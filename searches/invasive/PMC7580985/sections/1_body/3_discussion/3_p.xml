<p>Few previous studies on biological invasions have reported details on the differential abundance of taxa, and among these we found limited general consensus. For example, some studies report a decrease in abundance of bacteria associated with nitrogen cycling (e.g. Nitrosphaeria, Nitrospira, Nitrosomonadales) [

 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], while others report an increase of Nitrosomonadaceae following invasion [
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In our study some groups associated with the nitrogen cycle were positively associated with biological invasions (i.e. Nitrosomonadaceae, Pirellulaceae, Chitinophagaceae) while others were negatively associated (Beijerinckiaceae, Micromonosporaceae). Unfortunately, amplicon-based sequencing has a limited power to infer changes in the functions of microbiomes. Future metagenomic and metatranscriptomic studies are needed to investigate whether biological invasions alter gene content or gene expression of environmental microbiomes, and whether this reflects changes in biogeochemical cycling.
