<p>Here, we aim to test whether the effect of biological invasion on environmental microbiomes can be generalized or is idiosyncratic. To do so, we collected publicly available data and re-analyzed this data under a common framework. We tested the effect of invasive species on the diversity and structure of environmental microbiomes, with the hypothesis that the presence of invasive species will decrease microbial diversity and alter the composition of the environmental microbiome. We then investigated whether certain taxonomical groups are more responsive to biological invasions.</p>
