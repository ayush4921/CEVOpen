<p>Our ability to draw broad conclusions from published studies is limited, because individual studies have occurred within a limited geographical range or with a limited group of species. Meta-analyses of published biological means have long enabled more robust conclusions than individual studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, the meta-analytic approach has less frequently been applied to amplicon-sequencing data that represent environmental microbiome community composition. The majority of meta-analytic metabarcoding studies have occurred in the medical sciences [

 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This approach can be successfully used to address ecological questions. For example, meta-analytic metabarcoding studies have found common patterns in the structure of indoor microbiomes [
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and freshwater eukaryotes [
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Shade et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] also used a meta-analysis of metabarcoding datasets from different environments highlighting a time-dependent structure of microbiomes. A meta-analytic approach has also been used to test the effects of stressors (e.g. water availability, temperature, heavy metals) on environmental microbiomes [
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Thus meta-analyses on microbiome data have a striking potential to address global-scale questions, generate new hypotheses and model common patterns [
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], because they provide across study comparisons [
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
