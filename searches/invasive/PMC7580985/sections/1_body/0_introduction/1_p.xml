<p>Biological invasions have severe impacts on biodiversity, community composition and ecosystem functions [

 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Invasive plants can alter many important ecosystem functions including the nitrogen cycle [
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], carbon cycle, and decomposition. For example, invasion by the plant Amur Honeysuckle altered the decomposition rate in the invaded environment likely through changes in litter quality [
