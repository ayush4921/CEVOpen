<p>Previous studies have shown biological invasions can impact the diversity and taxonomical structure of environmental microbiomes. For example, we often see a shift in soil microbiota following invasion by non-native plant species [

 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Removal of feral pigs increased the diversity of soil bacterial communities and shifted their structure [

 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], mussels [
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and jellyfish [
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] produce changes in the structure of water microbiomes. However, shifts in environmental microbiome as consequence of biological invasions do not always occur. For example, invasion by the plants

 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> sp. [
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and 
 <italic>Vincetoxicum rossicum</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] did not alter the structure of soil microbial communities. Also, some microcosms exposed to the simultaneous invasion of multiple plant species [
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] did not alter soil microbiomes. Similarly, soil microbiome structure in microcosms did not change with the addition of the invasive earthworm 
 <italic>Aporrectodea trapezoides</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Several of these studies used techniques (e.g. DGGE, PLFA, t-RFLP) that limit fine scale investigations of biological invasions on environmental microbiome diversity and taxonomical composition. Among the studies using high-throughput amplicon-sequencing techniques, most did not find changes in microbiome diversity [

 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], few reported a decrease of microbial diversity in response to invasion [
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and fewer still reported an increase [
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Thus, there is little consensus on the effects of biological invasions on the diversity and taxonomical structure of the environmental microbiomes, both tied to the stability and function of microbial communities [
