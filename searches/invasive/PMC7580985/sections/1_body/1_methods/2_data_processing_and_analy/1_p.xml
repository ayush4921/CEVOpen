<p>Paired-end reads were merged using FLASH 1.2.11 [
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and data were processed using QIIME 1.9.1 [
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Quality-filtering of reads was performed using default parameters, binning OTUs and discarding chimeric sequences identified with VSEARCH 2.14.2 [
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Taxonomy for representative sequences was determined by querying against the SILVA database v132 [
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] using the BLAST method. A phylogeny was obtained by aligning representative sequences using MAFFT v7.464 [
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] and reconstructing a phylogenetic tree using FastTree [
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].
