<p>We took the following steps to alleviate some of the potential sources of bias due to studies performed in different labs, using different protocols and sequenced on different instruments. First, all studies included were performed using the Illumina MiSeq platform, in order to reduce the potential bias that might be generated by directly comparing data obtained from different platforms. Second, all studies targeted the same region of the 16S rRNA, as several primer pairs targeting different regions are currently published and widely used. Three out of five papers we considered in our analysis used the 515F/806R primer pair [
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], while two used the 341F/785R [
 <xref rid="pone.0240996.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Because these primer pairs overlap in the V4 region of 16S rRNA we feel confident that the chance of including spurious OTUs in our analysis is quite negligible. To account for study-specific variances due to small differences in sampling procedures and lab protocols, we also included the study itself, the environment where the study was performed (i.e., soil or water) and the identity of the invasive species as stratification variables in the PERMANOVA and as random factors in our linear model. This allowed us to ensure that our results are not biased by study-specific features.
