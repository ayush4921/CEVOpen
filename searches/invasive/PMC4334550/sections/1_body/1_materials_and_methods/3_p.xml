<p>Rodents are known to respond to lunar cycle independent of visual stimuli, with behavioral activity tracking moon phase [

 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. For each night, we obtained moon phase data for our area from the US Naval Observatory’s sun and moon data portal [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], reported as the fraction of the moon illuminated during each night in our study on a continuous scale of 0 (new moon) to 1.0 (full moon). However, on-the-ground visual lunar illumination is also affected by the rise and set times of the sun and moon, cloud cover, and other factors. Therefore, we also calculated ‘lunar-minutes’ for each night in the study as the product of moon illumination (0–1.0) and the time (in minutes) the moon was above the horizon after the end of civil twilight and before the onset of twilight the following morning (moonrise, moonset, and beginning and ending on twilight obtained from [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]). Qualitatively, our results were the same whether the effects on moonlight on GUD were analyzed using the fraction of moon illuminated (0–1.0) or lunar-minutes, and they were strongly positively correlated (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.9). For brevity, here we present results only for analyses using lunar-minutes. Kotler et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] showed that the sequence and phase of the lunar cycle is also important, with rodents responding differently to waxing and waning moons with the same amount of illumination. In our study, locations 1 and 3 were run with waning moons, while location 2 was run with a waxing moon.
