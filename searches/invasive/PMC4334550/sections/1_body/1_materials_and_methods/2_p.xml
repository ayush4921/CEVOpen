<p>We examined perceived predation risk by measuring GUDs on three locations with two sites each, one in 
 <italic>Ammophila</italic>-dominated habitat and the other in restored habitat. In each site, GUD was measured from 25 food stations arranged in a 5×5 grid (5 m spacing between stations) placed in each site. Each food station contained an uncovered clear plastic tub (Rubbermaid #3Q24; 42.7 × 33.8 × 13.5 cm) with six holes (7.6 cm diameter) drilled on the sides to allow for rodent accessibility and filled with 10.0 g of shelled sunflower seeds (kernels) mixed in with 1.0 L of sifted local dune sand. Livetrapping indicates the dominant rodents in this system are California voles (
 <italic>Microtus californicus</italic>), deer mice (
 <italic>Peromyscus maniculatus</italic>), and western harvest mice (
 <italic>Reithrodontomys megalotis;</italic> unpublished data). These rodents are primarily granivorous and nocturnal during the dry summer months in California [

 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. To collect nocturnal GUD data, sunflower seeds were deployed at dusk (19:00–21:00 PDT) and those remaining the following morning were sifted through wire mesh and collected. Patches were refilled with 1 L of sand and 10.0 g of fresh sunflower seeds. In the laboratory, collected seeds were separated from other particles, dried in an oven (60°C for at least 56 h) and then weighed. The mass in grams of the dried seeds is the GUD for a given patch on a given night. This process was repeated for six nights on each grid. To avoid confounding temporal effects with habitat comparisons, we ran the two grids at each location simultaneously, one on an 
 <italic>Ammophila</italic>-dominated site and one on a restored site. Location 1 was run from 19 to 24 June, location 2 was run 5–10 July, and location 3 was run 20–25 July.
