<p>To examine the GUD data, we first performed a Mantel test on the geographic distance and the mean GUD among feeding stations in order to assess the appropriateness of treating GUDs from each station as spatially independent samples. Independence was confirmed (see 
 <xref rid="sec003" ref-type="sec">Results</xref>), so we treated each feeding station independently in subsequent analyses. GUDs were normally distributed, so we used parametric analyses to maximize statistical power. We analyzed the data in two ways. First, we calculated the mean number of lunar-minutes over each 6 night trial, yielding three values (one for each location [pair of grids run simultaneously]). We used the mean GUD at each feeding station over the 6-night trial as the response variable in a 2-way ANOVA with habitat (
 <italic>Ammophila</italic>-dominated or restored) as one factor and mean lunar-minutes as the other factor. This analysis assessed main and interactive effects of habitat and lunar-minutes, but averaging moonlight over six nights masked what could be important variation. So, second, we used the GUD at each feeding station each night as the response variable in a linear mixed effects model with each station as a subject, night (1–6) nested within location as a subject factor (repeated measures), habitat as a fixed between subject effect, number of lunar-minutes as a fixed covariate. Over a six-night trial, the number of lunar minutes changed while the location stayed constant, so location was nested within lunar minutes as a random effect. We used an alpha level of 0.05 for these analyses, which were performed in R [
