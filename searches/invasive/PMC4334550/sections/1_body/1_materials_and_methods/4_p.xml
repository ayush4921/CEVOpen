<p>We measured plant cover at each feeding station by laying down a 1m
 <sup>2</sup> frame centered on each food station and visually estimating the cover (to nearest 10%) of each plant species with at least 10% cover. To aid in visualization, the frame was demarked with intersecting lines to demark 25 equally sized (20 × 20 cm) areas. Cover data were not normally distributed, so we analyzed differences in cover between habitats using non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests. We performed tests for each of the 24 species with at least 10% cover at feeding station, as well as for total cover, so we used Bonferroni’s adjustment to control for experimental wise error rate by lowering alpha for these tests down to 0.002.
