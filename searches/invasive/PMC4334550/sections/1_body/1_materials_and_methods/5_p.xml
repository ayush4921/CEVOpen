<p>We also placed motion-activated infrared video cameras (Primos Truthcam35) at some of the feeding stations to confirm the presence of rodent seed predators. Locations for cameras were chosen to minimize risk of theft, so they are not random sample of food patches and are used here only for descriptive purposes. Four cameras were deployed on each of the pair of sites run simultaneously. The cameras were attached at a height of 1 m to wooden stakes driven into the sand approximately 1.5 m away from a feeding station and oriented downward toward the interior of the stationâ€™s box. After trial runs, we learned that at this close range the infrared light source needed to be dampened to avoid overexposing the video, which we accomplished by using black electrical tape to obscure some of the bulbs.</p>
