<p>Results of this study support the hypothesis that cover provided by the invasive beach grass 
 <italic>Ammophila arenaria</italic> lowers the perceived predation risk for foraging rodents. Overall, the amount of seeds left behind by foraging rodents (the GUD), an indicator of perceived predation risk [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], was lower in the thick uniform vegetation on 
 <italic>Ammophila</italic>-dominated habitat than it was in the more sparsely and diversely vegetated restored habitat. There was also some support, though less consistent, for the hypothesis that the perceived safety provided by cover may depend on moonlight, with strongest differences during nights with more lunar light. Both a 2-way ANOVA and a mixed model showed significant main effects of lunar-minutes on GUD, with the former also showing a strong interaction in which GUD was lower in 
 <italic>Ammophila</italic> only when the number of lunar minutes was intermediate or high (
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). This interaction was not significant in the mixed model, which did not pool results across the six nights of each trial.
