<p>Perceived predation may be revealed by measuring GUDs, but this may or may not reflect actual risk of predation. Several studies involving GUDs suggest that rodents may perceive predation risk indirectly by monitoring vegetative structure and responding accordingly, regardless of other direct cues (e.g., number of predators) or true risk of death [

 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. For example, Orrock et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] found that mice at the Savannah River site in North Carolina perceived predation risk as a function of vegetative cover and moon illumination and were unresponsive to experimental direct cues (urine from predators). In our study system, the most important predators of rodents are probably gray foxes (

 <italic>(Felis catus)</italic>, barn owls (
 <italic>Tyto alba</italic>), and perhaps some snakes (e.g., California red-sided garter snake 
 <italic>Thamnophis sirtalis infernalis</italic>). All of these predators except the snakes should be hindered by the cover [
