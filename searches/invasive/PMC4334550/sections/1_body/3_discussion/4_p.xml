<p>Kotler et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] illustrated the importance of the lunar cycle to rodent foraging. They clarified that is not merely a matter of light intensity, but also a matter of sequence and context [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Nocturnal rodents forage and cache food during the darker period of the cycle, building up their energetic state. On the brighter period of the cycle, they lower predation risks by foraging less and relying on their reserves that deplete during this period. Therefore, as the moon wanes and the nights become darker, rodents invest more effort in foraging to recover their state effort (which should lead to low GUDs), whereas as the moon waxes and the light increases they reduce foraging (which should raise GUDs). In our study, the sites with high and intermediate moonlight (sites 1 and 3) were monitored during a waning moon when rodents may increase foraging to recover state, while the site with low moonlight (site 2) was monitored during the time when rodents reduce foraging. Therefore, due to the timing of the data collection, it is impossible to determine whether rodents foraged more at invaded sites on locations 1 and 3 because of the number of lunar minutes, the moon phase, or both.
