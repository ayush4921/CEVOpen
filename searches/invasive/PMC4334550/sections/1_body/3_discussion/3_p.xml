<p>Mattos and Orrock [

 <italic>Lonicera maackii</italic> in oak-hickory forests of Missouri USA, lowered risk perceived by granivorous rodents, but that this effect was contingent on abiotic factors, including both moonlight and temperature. Our results extend their finding to another invasive species and region, suggesting that moonlight may more generally mediate the effect of safety perceived in habitats dominated by high densities of invasive plants. Temperature did not vary enough among nights in our study period (June/July 2010) to merit analysis, so we cannot comment on possible effects of temperature in our system. Together, results of our study and those of Mattos and Orrock [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] underscore that simply examining the effects of invasive plants on wildlife behavior may not be enough, because their effects may be altered by abiotic factors.
