<p>Understanding how invasive plants may alter predator avoidance behaviors is especially important for granivorous rodents because their foraging can trigger ripple effects in trophic webs [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. If invasive plants provide a novel high-cover and low-risk habitat for native consumers, the resulting shifts in foraging behavior can alter the impact of consumers on plant populations [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Foraging animals are also affected by abiotic factors such as temperature [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], rainfall [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and, especially for nocturnal mammals, moonlight [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, we are aware of only one previous study that assessed how an abiotic factor (moon phase) may act in concert and possibly interact with effects of invasive plant species on animal foraging. Mattos and Orrock [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] found that the exotic invasive shrub 
 <italic>Lonicera maackii</italic> decreased perceived predation risk for rodents, but this effect was contingent on both moonlight and temperature.
