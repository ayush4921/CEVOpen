<p>Here, we examined rodent foraging in a coastal ecosystem by measuring GUDs in areas with and without abundant cover from 
 <italic>Ammophila</italic> and under varying amount of moonlight. We hypothesized that perceived predation risk would be lower (i.e., lower GUD) in the 
 <italic>Ammophila</italic>-dominated habitat because of abundant cover [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We also hypothesized that if moonlight helps predators capture their rodent prey more than it helps rodents evade predators [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], then rodent perceived predation risk (and GUD) should increase with increasing moonlight. Finally, we hypothesized that the perceived safety provided by cover may depend on moonlight, with strongest differences during nights with more lunar light.
