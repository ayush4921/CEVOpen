<p>The invasive European beach grass 
 <italic>Ammophila arenaria</italic> (hereafter, 
 <italic>Ammophila</italic>) was planted in California USA in the early 1900s to stabilize coastal dune habitats. It is now fully naturalized in central and northern California and has supplanted populations of native dune plants in many areas, including the North Spit of Humboldt Bay in northwestern California [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It reaches notoriously high levels of cover that differ drastically from sparser native dune plant communities, effectively creating a novel habitat in both composition and structure [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Maron and Simms found rodent granivory can strongly affect plant demography in Californiaâ€™s coastal ecosystems ([19, [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]), and the novel high cover provided by 
 <italic>Ammophila</italic> can affect rodent foraging and its consequences. For example, Dangremond et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] showed that, when close to 
 <italic>Ammophila</italic>-dominated habitat, the endangered coastal dune plant 
 <italic>Lupinus tidestromii</italic> experiences high levels of predispersal seed consumption by rodents. This may be due to lower perceived predation risk by rodents foraging in close proximity to the cover provided by 
 <italic>Ammophila</italic>, but this mechanism has not yet been tested.
