<p>As plant invasions continue to alter ecosystems worldwide [

 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], it becomes increasingly important to understand their effects on trophic relationships of native species. Invasive plants can dramatically alter the structure and composition of areas they invade [

 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], effectively creating novel habitats [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Habitat composition and structure are well known to affect animal behavior [

 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], but to date there have been few studies examining how plant invasions may affect consumersâ€™ avoidance of predation [
