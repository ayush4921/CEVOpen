<p>Foraging habitat selection by rodents can be measured by the use of ‘giving-up-densities’ (GUDs; e.g., [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]). In a depletable food patch, harvest rate for a consumer diminishes as food becomes increasingly scarce. The GUD is the density of food at which a forager ceases to feed in a food patch, which should occur when the marginal benefit of harvesting no longer outweighs the marginal cost of foraging. Foraging costs include metabolism, cost of harvesting, predation risk, and the cost of missed opportunities, i.e., the cost of not foraging elsewhere [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Thus, the GUD reflects the harvest rate when a rodent decides to stop foraging [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Trays containing seeds mixed with local sand have been used extensively to assess GUDs and measure how granivores value different foraging patches, especially in arid environments [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, there has been very little research on GUDs for rodents in coastal ecosystems [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], despite the potential for rodent foraging to strongly affect coastal ecosystem processes [
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].
