<p>A two-way ANOVA revealed strong effects of habitat, lunar-minutes, and their interaction on GUD (
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Overall, there was a significant main effect of habitat, with higher GUDs in the restored than in the 
 <italic>Ammophila</italic>-dominated habitat, consistent with the hypothesis that perceived predation risk diminishes with abundant cover. The main effect of lunar-minutes was also significant, with GUDs highest at intermediate values and the lowest GUDs on nights with low lunar-minutes. There also was a strongly significant interaction between habitat and lunar-minutes; GUD was lower in 
 <italic>Ammophila</italic> (lower predation risk) only when the number of lunar minutes was intermediate or high (
