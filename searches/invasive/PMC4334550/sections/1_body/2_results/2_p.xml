<p>Results of the Mantel tests indicated that there was little evidence for spatial autocorrelation among the feeding stations. Only one of the six tests (one test for each grid) was significant (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.014 based on 9999 permutations), and with Bonferroni adjustments for multiple comparisons (alpha lowered to 0.008), none was significant. Therefore, we analyzed the data with each GUD station (25/grid, 6 grids) treated as a sample unit.
