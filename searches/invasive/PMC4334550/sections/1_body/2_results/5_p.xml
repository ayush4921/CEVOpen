<p>The mixed effects linear model also revealed main effects of habitat and lunar-minutes, as well as location (
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). GUDs were higher in restored than 
 <italic>Ammophila</italic>-dominated habitat. There was also a main effect of location, with location 3 having higher GUD than the others, and a significant interaction between lunar-minutes and location, with GUDs at location 3 (intermediate lunar minutes) showing a strong positive association with increasing lunar minutes, whereas there was a slightly negative association with increasing lunar-minutes elsewhere. However, the interaction between habitat and moonlight was not statistically significant. Effects on individual nights within the six = night trial were not discernible because they were treated as random effects. In a few cases GUD values exceeded 10 g (initial seed weight) due to little or no foraging combined with persistent moisture or imperfect removal of sand, but this capacity should not have differed significantly between habitats or over lunar-minutes. Remote video evidence confirmed that seeds in the foraging trays were foraged for and consumed by (at least): California voles (
 <italic>Microtus californicus</italic>) and deer mice (
 <italic>Peromyscus maniculatus</italic>), which we observed in each of the two habitats. Other species observed also included gray foxes (
 <italic>Urocyon cinereoargenteus</italic>) and striped skunks (
 <italic>Mephitis mephitis</italic>), but they did not forage on seeds in the trays.
