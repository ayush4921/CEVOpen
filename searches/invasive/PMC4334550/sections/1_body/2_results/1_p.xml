<p>Total plant cover was significantly higher in the 
 <italic>Ammophila</italic>-dominated habitat (92.3%) than in the restored habitat (44.9%; 
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The 
 <italic>Ammophila</italic>-dominated habitat was comprised almost exclusively of 
 <italic>Ammophila</italic> (85.6% cover); the species with the next highest cover was 
 <italic>Baccharus pilularis</italic> (2.7% cover). The restored habitat was much more diverse, with five species showing significantly higher cover than in the 
 <italic>Ammophila</italic>-dominated habitat: 
 <italic>Abronia latifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>Achillea millefolium</italic>, 
 <italic>Erigonum latifolium</italic>, 
 <italic>Lathyrus littoralis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Solidago spathulata</italic> (
 <xref rid="pone.0117903.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Overall, 24 species were detected with at least 10% cover at a feeding station, 10 species in the 
 <italic>Ammophila</italic>-dominated habitat, 18 in the restored habitat, and four species that occurred in both. Four of the species that are considered invasive: 
 <italic>Ammophila</italic>, 
 <italic>Briza maxima</italic>, and 
 <italic>Lupinus arboreus</italic> were recorded only in the 
 <italic>Ammophila</italic>-dominated habitat, while 
 <italic>Carpobrutus edulis</italic> was recorded only in the restored habitat.
