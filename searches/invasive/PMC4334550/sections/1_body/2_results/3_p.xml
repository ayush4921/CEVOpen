<p>The number of lunar-minutes during a night varied from 28.1 to 281.4, with moon illumination varying from 0.23 to 0.83, over the course of the study. The mean number of lunar-minutes (±1 SE) was 176.8 (±30.3) for location 1, 116.4 (±31.5) for location 2, and 155.0 (±33.1) for location 3 (2 simultaneous grids at each location); these differences were statistically significant (ANOVA: F
 <sub>2,897</sub> = 55.8,
