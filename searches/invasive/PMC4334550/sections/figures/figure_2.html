 <caption> Effect of habitat and moonlight on giving up density. Mean (Â±1 SE) nocturnal giving-up-density of food (GUD) left behind on feeding stations deployed in Ammophila-dominated and restored habitats in the coastal dunes of Northwestern California, June-July 2011. The experiment was run under three moonlight conditions based on the number of lunar-minutes (product of fractional moon illumination and the number of minutes the moon was above the horizon after the end of civil twilight and before the onset of twilight the following morning): low moonlight (116.4), intermediate moonlight (155.0), and high moonlight (176.8). </caption>
