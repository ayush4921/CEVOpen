<p id="Par7">Here, we investigated whether there were distinct rhizosphere bacterial communities associated with different

 </sup>, homogeneity of rhizosphere bacteria within 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> lineages across the sampling range, along with heterogeneity among lineages in our field experiment, would be consistent with our hypothesis that lineage-specific forcing is structuring rhizosphere bacterial communities. Our results, confirmed in both a field survey and a common garden experiment, indicate that the rhizosphere bacterial community is structured by plant lineage, with the Introduced lineage demonstrating evidence of decreased enemy attack compared to the Gulf and Native lineages.
