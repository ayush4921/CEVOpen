 <italic>Phragmites australis</italic> is a globally distributed plant that is also a harmful invader in North America. It is among the best-studied uncultivated plants
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup> and is considered a model species for plant invasions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>. In North America there are at least three lineages of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> that grow sympatrically, including an invasive lineage (haplotype M, hereafter “Introduced”) that was introduced to North America from Europe
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup> at least 150 years ago
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup>. Other lineages of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> include multiple haplotypes of the native North American lineage (hereafter “Native”), and one Gulf coast lineage, (haplotype I, hereafter “Gulf”), whose origin is undetermined but appears to have been present in North America for thousands of years
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>. Across North America, Introduced 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> is highly dominant in coastal and inland marshes, affects multiple trophic levels and ecosystem processes, and is costly to eradicate
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>. Because the three different lineages of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> are widespread and grow sympatrically across North America, this species provides a unique opportunity to study the similarities and differences in the rhizosphere bacterial communities both among plant lineages with known phylogenies and across a wide range of geographical distances.
