<p id="Par3">Interactions between plants and soil microorganisms that occur in the rhizosphere create microhabitats that result in plant species-specific rhizosphere microbial communities. These interactions are highly localized in the region immediately adjacent to plant roots and play a critical role in plant fitness

However, we lack an understanding of the extent of intraspecific variation in plant–soil microbe interactions, particularly among invasive plant populations, which could provide insights into why some genotypes are more successful than others. While there is evidence of intraspecific variation in microbial communities among cultivated plant species
