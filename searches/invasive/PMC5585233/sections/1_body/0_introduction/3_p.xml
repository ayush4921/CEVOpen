If true, we might expect to see a greater homogeneity in the microbial community structure of native populations compared to introduced populations because of the need to maintain robust pathogen defenses. In contrast, invasive populations that do not use resources for pathogen defense would be more likely to have divergent microbial communities that are dominated by local soil generalists
