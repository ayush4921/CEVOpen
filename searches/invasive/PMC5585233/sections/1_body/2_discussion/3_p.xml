 </sup>. As a result, the bacterial communities associated with the native lineage should be similar regardless of geographical location. The much greater similarity observed within the Native and Gulf lineages, compared to the Introduced lineage, both in our field and our common garden experiment, supports this conclusion. The different abundances of important protein pathways that we observe (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) add additional support for the enemy release hypothesis. Introduced 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> rhizosphere microbial communities had significantly lower abundances of pathways involved in antimicrobial biosynthesis and degradation, suggesting a lower exposure to enemy attack. Introduced 
 <italic>P. australis</italic>, when freed from pathogens that were present in its native range, cease to dedicate resources to cultivation of a pathogen defense system. Thus, the bacterial community in the rhizosphere soils should show a greater contribution of local soil generalists, rather than specific taxa cultivated for pathogen defense. The greater change in bacterial turnover with distance in the Introduced lineage compared to the other lineages suggests that Introduced populations have a greater reliance on novel associations in soils from the introduced range that are derived from the pool of local microflora, a pool that would be expected to decrease in similarity with distance from the source population
