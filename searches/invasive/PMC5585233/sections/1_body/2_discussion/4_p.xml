<p id="Par18">Our results support that the 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> lineage played a critical role in structuring bacterial communities across large spatial scales. The importance of lineage overwhelmed the importance of local environmental factors in structuring bacterial communities both in the field and in a common garden greenhouse experiment. Globally, the spread of invasive species has reduced biodiversity

 </sup>, and this work highlights another potential impact of species invasionsâ€”lineage-specific reshaping of endemic microbial communities. The higher belowground biomass of the Introduced 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> lineage, compared to the Native lineage and to other native wetland plants it displaces, suggests that invasion-induced changes in microbial community could be widespread, though further work is needed to determine how far into the bulk soil these changes propagate. Microbes play key roles in ecosystem function and this bottom-up engineering of the rhizosphere microbial community assembly by plant lineage could have repercussions for important ecosystem services provided by microbes, such as nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration. It is therefore essential that we take the next step to determine how these lineage-specific changes in the rhizosphere bacterial community translate to changes in 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> associated ecosystem function.
