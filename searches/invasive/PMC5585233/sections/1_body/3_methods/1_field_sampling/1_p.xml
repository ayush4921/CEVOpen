<p id="Par19">During the summer and fall of 2015, we collected soil samples to assess the bacterial communities associated with Native, Introduced, and Gulf 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> rhizosphere (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). We ran 20 m transects through the middle of previously identified stands of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> and excavated belowground material every 5 m, starting with an initial sampling at 0 m and collecting additional samples at 5, 10, 15 and 20 m distances (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5 samples per transect, which we have previously shown to be robust to capture the dynamics within and between different plant rhizosphere bacterial communities

 </sup>). At each sampling location we collected the soil directly associated with the roots. Soil samples were preserved in RNAlater and stored at −20 °C. At the same time, aboveground plant tissue was collected to verify lineage and for measurement of carbon, nitrogen, and gallic acid concentration. Haplotypes of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> lineages were confirmed by cpDNA sequencing
