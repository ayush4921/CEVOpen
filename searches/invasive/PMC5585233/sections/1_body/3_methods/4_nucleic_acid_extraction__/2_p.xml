 </sup> on an Illumina MiSeq (San Diego, CA). Each sample was amplified in triplicate with a unique 12 base barcode to enable pooling of multiple samples per sequencing run. PCR products were cleaned via gel purification using the Qiagen QIAquick gel extraction kit (Valencia, CA) and were fluorometrically quantified using a ThermoFisher Qubit (Waltham, MA). Final PCR products were pooled in equimolar ratios and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform with a 300 cycle V2 chemistry sequencing kit.
