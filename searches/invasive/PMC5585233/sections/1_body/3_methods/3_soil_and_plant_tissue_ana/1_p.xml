<p id="Par21">Plant shoots and roots were oven-dried at 70 °C to a constant biomass and weighed to determine the total aboveground and belowground biomass for each plant. Leaves were lyophilized and ground to a fine powder in the laboratory. Carbon and nitrogen content of both the aboveground and belowground plant tissue was determined on a Perkin Elmer 2400 Series Elemental Analyzer (Waltham, MA) at the University of Massachusetts Environmental Analytical Facility following standard operating procedures. The coefficient of variation in replicate analysis was 0.016 for %C and 0.025 for %N. Total phenolics (nM g
 <sup>−1</sup> of dried plant tissue) were estimated using a microplate modified version of the Folin–Ciocalteu method
