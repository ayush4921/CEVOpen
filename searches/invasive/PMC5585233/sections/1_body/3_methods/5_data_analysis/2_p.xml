We assessed changes in community structure with distance by plotting the pairwise Bray–Curtis dissimilarity coefficient against pairwise distance between locations and calculated the linear regression between the two in R. We used PiCrust

After normalization PiCrust predicted the metagenomic content of each sample. We then used HUManN

 </sup> to generate pathway summaries and separated out those pathways associated with bacterial metabolisms for use in the structural equation model. We tested for significant differences in three specific pathway associated with plant–microbe interactions, toxin and metal detoxification, antimicrobial biosynthesis, and antimicrobial degradation using analysis of variance, followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test in R.
