<p id="Par8">We performed a field survey in which we collected rhizosphere soils from multiple 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> populations across three lineages at 21 locations spanning the continental United States (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). At three locations (Block Island, RI; Great Bay, NH; and Falmouth, MA), we collected rhizosphere soil samples from co-occurring Native and Introduced 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> populations, allowing us to more closely examine the relative strength of both lineage and geographic proximity in structuring rhizosphere bacterial communities. It is possible, however, that homogeneity in the bacterial community within lineages could also arise from different microhabitat preferences maintained by each lineage, so we confirmed the role of lineage as a driver of bacterial community structure in a common garden experiment. We grew multiple populations from each lineage individually from surface sterilized rhizomes in homogenized (though not sterilized) potting soil under identical greenhouse conditions. For both the field and common garden experiment we used high throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to examine the entire bacterial community and its gene product, 16S rRNA, to assess which bacteria were actively synthesizing proteins and were therefore more likely to be influencing plant fitness (see Methods).
