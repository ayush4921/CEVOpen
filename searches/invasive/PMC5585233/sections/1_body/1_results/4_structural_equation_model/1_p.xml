<p id="Par14">Whether changes in the bacterial community affect invasion success ultimately depends on how these changes influence plant fitness related traits, measured here as biomass. However, plant fitness might also be driven by other modified soil properties or solely by plant lineage. We teased apart these direct and indirect effects of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> lineage using Structural Equation Modeling

 </sup>. Common garden Introduced populations had lower bacterial activity and metabolism than Native and Gulf 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> populations. Surprisingly, this lineage effect on bacterial community structure did not translate into altered biomass of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> plants (Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Rather, while 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> lineage shaped the bacterial community, its activity, and belowground soil properties, the influence of lineage on aboveground and belowground biomass was solely via direct effects. Thus, 
 <italic>Phragmites australis</italic> lineage appears to be the primary driver of differences in the rhizosphere ecosystem and in plant biomass, at least for the 4-month-old plants in this common garden experiment. It is worth noting, however, that the observed differences in in the rhizosphere bacterial community could have indirect effects on co-occurring plants through spillover of generalist pathogens or mutualists, or by altering competitive interactions
