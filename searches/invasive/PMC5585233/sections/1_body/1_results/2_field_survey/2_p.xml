<p id="Par10">The rhizosphere bacterial communities within the Gulf and Native lineages demonstrated stronger within-lineage similarity than the Introduced lineage (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The lower overall similarity in community structure among Introduced populations ultimately resulted in an overall higher bacterial richness in the Introduced lineage compared to the other lineages (Supplementary Fig.

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The similarity among the bacterial communities within the Introduced lineage decreased with distance, a pattern not observed in the Native and Gulf lineages and indicative of a higher rate of bacterial turnover in the Introduced lineage rhizospheres.
