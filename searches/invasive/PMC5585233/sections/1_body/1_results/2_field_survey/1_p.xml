<p id="Par9">Even at continental scales, our results reveal a remarkable influence of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> lineage on the structure of the bacterial community (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). A principal coordinates analysis of Bray–Curtis similarity indicates that the rhizosphere bacterial communities of the Native, Gulf, and Introduced lineages were distinct from one another, regardless of where in North America they were collected (permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA);

 <sub>2,107</sub> = 22.38, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). We also found similar results when we examined the potentially active community (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>; PERMANOVA, 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>2,75</sub> = 8.13, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), indicating that lineage may be a sufficiently strong determinant of bacterial community structure that it overwhelms local environmental conditions even among the active community, which would be more likely to respond to local environmental variation.
