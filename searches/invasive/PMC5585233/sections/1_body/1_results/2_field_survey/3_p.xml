<p id="Par11">We examined the core microbiome of each lineage (taxa present in 100% of samples collected from across the continent). Despite striking differences in community structure among lineages (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), bacterial taxa within lineages displayed a core set of taxa that were consistent across large geographic regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Core microbiome members were predominantly heterotrophic taxa likely able to take advantage of the high primary productivity of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic>. Surprisingly, while core Native and Gulf bacteria were sometimes present in the Introduced rhizospheres, abundances were typically low (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). For example, the deltaproteobacterial order Myxococcales was among the most abundant orders identified but 77% of all Myxococcales in the total community were found in Native rhizospheres and only 4% were found in Introduced rhizospheres (Supplementary Table
