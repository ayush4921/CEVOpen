<p id="Par13">To assess whether the lineage-specific differences in bacterial community structure could potentially play a role in plant fitness or invasion success, we used an ancestral state reconstruction model to infer the function of the bacterial community

 </sup>. We assessed three different KEGG pathways relevant to plant–microbe interactions, including Toxin and Metal Detoxification, Antimicrobial Biosynthesis, and Antimicrobial Degradation. All three pathways were significantly less abundant in the rhizospheres of the Introduced lineage after 4 months growing in our common garden experiment (Fig.
