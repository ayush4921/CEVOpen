<p id="Par12">To investigate experimentally how different 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> lineages shape the rhizosphere community and whether this ecosystem engineering contributes to plant fitness, we performed a common garden experiment on a subset of the field populations (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). We also sought to tease apart the effects of lineage on plant performance as mediated by lineage-specific effects on the soil bacterial community. We hypothesized that the three lineages grown in homogenized Metromix potting soil would develop distinct rhizosphere bacterial communities, and that these communities would influence plant productivity. Although similar initially (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, 
 <italic>purple</italic>), 4 months of conditioning by the three different lineages caused soil bacterial communities to diverge dramatically (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). The total bacterial community (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, 
 <italic>open symbols</italic>) formed three clusters; one from the Gulf, one exclusively from Introduced, and one that was a mix of Introduced and Native. Consistent with our field results, the active bacterial community (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>) was strongly influenced by both lineage and source population. Active bacterial communities associated with the three Native populations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, 
 <italic>blue</italic>) were highly similar to each other, but divergent from Introduced and Gulf communities. In contrast, each individual population of active bacteria from both the Gulf (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, 
 <italic>green</italic>) and Introduced (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, 
 <italic>orange</italic>) lineages formed distinct non-overlapping clusters of points that were not only different from Native populations, but also different from each other.
