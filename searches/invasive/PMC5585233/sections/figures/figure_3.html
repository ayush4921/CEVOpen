 <caption> Microbial community structure of different lineages of Phragmites australis grown in a common garden experiment. a Principal coordinates analysis of Bray–Curtis dissimilarity for the entire ( open symbols) and active ( closed symbols) microbial community, along with the pre-incubation community ( purple). b Principal coordinates analysis of the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity values for just the active microbial community, indicating the importance of population (PERMANOVA, F 59,14 = 20.56, p &lt; 0.001), and lineage ( F 71,2 = 19.79, p &lt; 0.001) </caption>
