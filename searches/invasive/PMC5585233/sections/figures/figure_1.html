 <caption> Differences in microbial community structure among lineages and as a function of distance between sampling locations. a Principal coordinates analysis of Bray–Curtis dissimilarity for the microbial communities associated with Native ( green), Gulf ( blue) and Introduced ( orange) lineages of Phragmites australis, collected from across the United States (Supplementary Fig.  1). b Bray–Curtis dissimilarity plotted as a function of the distance (km) between sampling locations. Regression statistics are found in Supplementary Table  2. n = 5 replicates per P. australis population (eight Introduced populations, five Gulf populations, eight Native populations) </caption>
