 <caption> Structural Equation Model fitted with range-standardized coefficients. Solid lines indicate that the driver influences the likelihood of the model via a χ 2 Likelihood ratio test. Dashed paths indicate no detectable influence of the driver ( p &gt; 0.05). Standardized coefficients are presented for each path. Letters a and b denote groupings via post-hoc tests. χ 2 test statistics can be found in Supplementary Tables  5 and 6 </caption>
