  <p>Abundance of KEGG pathways potentially associated with plant–microbe interactions in the rhizosphere soils of Introduced, Gulf, and Native lineages. In each of the three pathways, data are the mean ± standard error of the mean and different letters denote significantly different means within each pathway. The abundance of each pathway was significantly lower in the Introduced lineage rhizosphere microbial communites than in those communities associated with the Gulf and Native lineages.
