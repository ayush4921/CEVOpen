 <p>Prior studies on preferences of native herbivores for native or exotic plants have tested both the enemy release hypothesis and the biotic resistance hypothesis and have reported inconsistent results. The different levels of resistance of native and exotic plants to native herbivores could resolve this controversy, but little attention has been paid to this issue. In this study, we investigated population performance, photosynthesis, leaf nitrogen concentration, and the constitutive and induced resistances of the successful invasive plant, 
  <italic>Alternanthera philoxeroides</italic>, and its native congener, 
  <italic>Alternanthera sessilis</italic>, in the presence of three population densities of the grasshopper, 
  <italic>Atractomorpha sinensis</italic>. When the grasshopper was absent, leaf biomass, total biomass, photosynthesis, and leaf nitrogen concentration of 
  <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> were higher than those of 
  <italic>A. sessilis</italic>. However, the morphological and physiological performances of 
  <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> were all decreased more intensively than 
  <italic>A. sessilis</italic> after herbivory by grasshoppers. Especially as the concentrations of constitutive lignin and cellulose in leaf of 
  <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> were higher than 
  <italic>A. sessilis</italic>, 
  <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> exhibited increased leaf lignin concentration to reduce its palatability only at severe herbivore load, whereas, leaf lignin, cellulose, and polyphenolic concentrations of 
  <italic>A. sessilis</italic> all increased with increasing herbivory pressure, and cellulose and polyphenolic concentrations were higher in 
  <italic>A. sessilis</italic> than in 
  <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> after herbivory. Our study indicated that the capability of the invasive plant to respond to native insect damage was lower than the native plant, and the invasive plant was suppressed more intensively than its native congener by the native insect. Our results support the biotic resistance hypothesis and suggest that native herbivores can constrain the abundance and reduce the adverse effects of invasive species.
