<p>Leaf biomass and total biomass showed an obvious decrease with increasing herbivore load levels (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083619-g001">Fig. 1a, b</xref>). A significant species×herbivory interaction indicated that changes in leaf biomass after herbivory differed among the two species (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0083619-t001">Table 1</xref>). Although leaf biomass of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> was higher than 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> in the control group, it was similar between the two species at both mild and severe herbivore load levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083619-g001">Fig. 1a</xref>), due to sharper decreases in 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> at both herbivore load levels (leaf biomass of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> decreased 46.2% and 69.2% at mild and severe herbivore load levels, respectively, while the decreases in 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> were 19.8% and 48.7% at mild and severe herbivore load levels, respectively). Total biomass of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> was significantly higher than that of 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> in the control group, although the differences were weakened at both mild and severe herbivore load levels, species×herbivory interaction was non-significant, total biomass of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> were still higher than 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> (
