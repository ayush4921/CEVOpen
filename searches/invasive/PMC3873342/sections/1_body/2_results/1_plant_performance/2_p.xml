<p>Herbivory significantly decreased the P

 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic>, but it only decreased the P

 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083619-g001">Fig. 1c, d, e</xref>). Changes to Fv/Fm, and leaf nitrogen concentration after herbivory differed among the two species, as indicated by the significant species×herbivory interactions (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0083619-t001">Table 1</xref>). In control groups, the Fv/Fm, and leaf nitrogen concentration of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> were higher than 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic>, however, these differences all disappeared at severe herbivore load levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083619-g001">Fig. 1d, e</xref>). Although the species×herbivory interaction for P
 <sub>max</sub> was not as strong as interactions for Fv/Fm, and leaf nitrogen concentration, it was moderately significant (p = 0.054), especially the sample size was low. And similar to Fv/Fm, and leaf nitrogen concentration, P
 <sub>max</sub> of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> was higher than 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> in control group, but difference also disappeared at severe herbivore load level (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083619-g001">Fig. 1c</xref>). In addition, under mild herbivore load, the P
 <sub>max</sub> of undamaged 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> leaves was significantly higher than damaged leaves, but there was no difference between damaged and undamaged leaves of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083619-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>). Conversely, the Fv/Fm of undamaged leaves of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> was significantly higher than damaged leaves, but damaged and undamaged leaves of 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> had similar Fv/Fm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083619-g002">Fig. 2b</xref>).
