<p>Herbivory greatly increased the leaf lignin, cellulose, and polyphenolic concentrations of 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic>, but it only increased the leaf lignin concentration of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0083619-t001">Table 1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083619-g001">Fig. 1f, g, h</xref>). The induction of these traits after herbivory differed among the two species, as indicated by the significant species×herbivory interactions (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0083619-t001">Table 1</xref>). The leaf lignin concentration of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> was higher than 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> in the control group, but the two species had similar leaf lignin concentrations after herbivory by 
 <italic>A. sinensis</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083619-g001">Fig. 1f</xref>). In the control group, the leaf cellulose concentration of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> was significantly higher than that of 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic>, but the differences were reversed at both mild and severe herbivore load levels, due to the increase in leaf cellulose concentration in 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083619-g001">Fig. 1g</xref>). Although the two species had similar leaf polyphenolic concentrations in the control group, 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> exhibited significantly higher leaf polyphenolic level when compared to 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> at both mild and severe herbivore load levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083619-g001">Fig. 1h</xref>). In addition, under mild herbivore load, while not significant at the alpha = 0.05 level, there was strong evidence suggesting that lignin and cellulose concentrations in undamaged leaves of 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> were lower than in damaged leaves (p = 0.07 and p = 0.062), but these traits did not differ in damaged and undamaged leaves of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> (
