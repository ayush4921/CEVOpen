<p>Many studies have tested these two hypotheses in different plant-animal systems, but results have been inconsistent. For instance, some studies have found that exotic plants suffered less herbivory than native plants in introduced ranges

 <xref rid="pone.0083619-Xiong1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, which is consistent with the enemy release hypothesis. However, other studies have shown that native herbivores prefer exotic plants over native plants

 <xref rid="pone.0083619-Morrison1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, which supports the biotic resistance hypothesis. Even within the same plant-animal system, conflicting results have been reported, depending on the field and laboratory settings. For example, Zas et al. 
 <xref rid="pone.0083619-Zas1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> found that pine weevils obviously preferred native pines over exotic pines in Petri dishes; however, this result was opposite in field trials because native pines produced more induced resistance than exotic congeners.
