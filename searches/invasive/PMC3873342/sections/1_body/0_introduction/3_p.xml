<p>Herbivores affect plant growth and fitness not only by damaging organs and tissues (e.g., leaves, phloem, roots, and twigs) but also by altering physiological traits. For instance, herbivory often affects the concentrations of available nitrogen and other important nutrients in foliage 
 <xref rid="pone.0083619-Karban1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, significantly decreases photosynthetic activity

 <xref rid="pone.0083619-Nabity1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and increases leaf conductance, transpiration rate, and intercellular CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration 
 <xref rid="pone.0083619-Marlina1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> of the remaining intact tissue. To minimize damage, plants have developed resistance strategies against herbivores. Resistance strategies should reduce the preference or performance of herbivores and include constitutive resistance (permanently expressed irrespective of herbivore attacks) and induced resistance (expressed only after herbivore attacks) 
 <xref rid="pone.0083619-NezFarfn1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. For instance, when an herbivore attacks a plant, phytohormone ethylene is produced by the damaged tissue and may influence the production of phenylalanine ammonia lyase, which determines the production of phenolics (such as lignin and other secondary metabolites), and ultimately affects leaf toughness 
 <xref rid="pone.0083619-Karban1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In addition, this induced resistance could grow as the level of damage to the plant increases
