<p>In introduced ranges, except when specialists switch to exotic congeners or specialists of exotic plants also are introduced to the same area, most exotic plants are free from specialist attack 
 <xref rid="pone.0083619-Keane1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, but they suffer damage from generalists, as native plants do. Theoretically, congeneric plants have similar growth and defense strategies 
 <xref rid="pone.0083619-Berenbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0083619-Harborne1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. However, according to the biotic resistance hypothesis, native plants should be able to defend against native generalist attack more effectively than exotics. Alternatively, if exotic plant defenses are uncommon or absent in the introduced range, native generalists would be deterred due to a lack of an effective detoxification mechanism 
 <xref rid="pone.0083619-Siemann1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0083619-Jogesh1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Therefore, differences in defenses between native and exotic species may explain native herbivore preference for them 
 <xref rid="pone.0083619-Zas1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, however, little attention has been paid to this aspect in the literature. Pearsea and Andrew 
 <xref rid="pone.0083619-Pearse1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> found the similarity of defensive traits between exotic and the native oak was predictive of the degree of chewing-guild herbivory that exotic oaks suffered. Zas et al. 
 <xref rid="pone.0083619-Zas1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> found that the native large pine weevil, 
 <italic>Hylobius abietis</italic>, preferred the exotic pine, 
 <italic>Pinus radiata,</italic> over its native congener, 
 <italic>P. pinaster</italic>, presumably because the native pine produced more resin in the stems when attacked. This study concluded that the native herbivore played a role in preventing 
 <italic>P. radiata</italic> from invading the region 
 <xref rid="pone.0083619-Zas1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Carrillo-Gavil√°n et al. 
 <xref rid="pone.0083619-CarrilloGaviln1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> also observed that the total amount of phenolics induced by herbivory damage from native, generalist insects were significantly greater in the native pines than in the closely related exotic pines. In addition, the concentration of total constitutive phenolics was higher in needles of exotic pines and in stems of native pines.
