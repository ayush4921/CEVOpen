<p>Invasive species cause significant ecological and socio-economic effects in introduced areas. To understand the mechanisms that allow exotics to become invasive, many hypotheses have been proposed. The enemy release hypothesis predicts that, in the absence of specialist enemies, generalist enemies have a greater impact on native competitors, which allows exotic species to outperform natives in introduced regions
