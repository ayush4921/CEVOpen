<p>The study subjects mentioned above were all exotic non-invasive plants. If an exotic plant is prevented from becoming invasive because it is less effective at resisting herbivory from native generalists than the native plant, it would be logical to assume that a successful invasive plant may be more effective at defending against native generalists than the native plant. However, we currently know little about differences in resistance strategies against native herbivores between native and successful invasive plants. Previous study showed biochemistry of invasive plant is no more deterrent to a native generalist herbivore than extracts from native plants 
 <xref rid="pone.0083619-Lind1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, but the study did not relate to induced resistance. In this study, we investigated damage caused by a native generalist grasshopper, 
 <italic>Atractomorpha sinensis</italic>, to an invasive aquatic plant, 
 <italic>Alternanthera philoxeroides</italic>, and its native congener, 
 <italic>Alternanthera sessilis</italic>. Performance and physiological responses, resistance strategies, and resistance intensity of the two plants to three population densities of grasshoppers were also evaluated. We attempted to address the following questions: (i) did the invasive plant suffer less damage than its native congener? (ii) were there any differences in performance and physiological responses in the two plants when they were attacked by 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic>? (iii) was the invasive plant more effective at defending against the native generalist than the native plant? (iv) were there any differences in resistance strategies of the plants at different levels of herbivore load?
