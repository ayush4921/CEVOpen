<p>The biotic resistance hypothesis proposes that native enemies have a greater impact on exotic plants than on native plants 
 <xref rid="pone.0083619-Parker1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Consistent with this hypothesis, our data indicated that both morphological traits (biomass and leaf biomass) and physiological traits (P
 <sub>max,</sub> Fv/Fm and leaf N concentration) of the invasive plant 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> were suppressed more intensely than those in its native congener 
 <italic>A. sessilis,</italic> by the native generalist 
 <italic>A. sinensis</italic>.
