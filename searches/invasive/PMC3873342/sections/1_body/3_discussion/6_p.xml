<p>In summary, we found that the induced resistance of 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> was more efficient and sophisticated than that of the invasive congener 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic>. Population performance, photosynthetic capacity and leaf nutrition content were reduced more in the invasive plant when compared to the metrics in the native plant. Our study suggests that the native herbivores can suppress the invasive plants. Although they rarely resist an invasion completely, native herbivores can constrain the abundance and reduce the adverse effects of invasive species once they have successfully established
