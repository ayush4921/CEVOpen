<p>Exotic prey usually lack effective defenses against native enemies in new regions where they share no evolutionary history with those enemies and have not experienced selection from them; therefore, native consumers may prefer exotic over native prey 
 <xref rid="pone.0083619-Parker1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. When exotic species encounter a novel, non-coevolved enemy, toxin-based defenses plants could obtain an inherent advantage because novel enemies lack proper detoxification mechanisms to unknown toxins, which would contribute to enemy release and invasive spread. However, elicitor-receptor plants would fail to recognize novel, non-coevolved enemies, which would contribute to biotic resistance and suppression of the invasion 
 <xref rid="pone.0083619-Verhoeven1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. In our study, the invasive plant 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> failed to respond to the attack of novel, non-coevolved enemies. In its original native range, the primary regulators of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> are specialists 
 <xref rid="pone.0083619-Coulson1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0083619-Sosa1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, which may exclude generalists from preying on the plants. The defense strategy of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> may aim primarily at specialists and therefore may be less efficient at deterring generalists. In our study, the induced resistance of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> was worse while its constitutive resistance was better when compared to its native congener, 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic>. Therefore, as the biotic resistance hypothesis suggests, our results show that the native generalist 
 <italic>A. sinensis</italic> can control the population of the invasive plant 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> more efficiently than its native congener 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic>, and thus potentially limits the invasion of the exotic plant
