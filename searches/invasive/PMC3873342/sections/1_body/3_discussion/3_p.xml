<p>Lignin and cellulose are major components of plant cell wall. Elevating lignin and cellulose contents increases leaf toughness and reduces plant palatability 
 <xref rid="pone.0083619-Wardle1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Polyphenol is a quantitative defensive component of plant quality, and has negative effects on the development and reproduction of herbivorous insects 
 <xref rid="pone.0083619-Bernays1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. In this study, we found that concentrations of constitutive lignin and cellulose in leaf of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> were higher than 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic>, both species had similar levels of leaf polyphenol. However, leaf polyphenolic, lignin, and cellulose concentrations all increased in 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> after herbivory by grasshoppers. In contrast, only the leaf lignin concentration increased in 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> after herbivory. In addition, the concentrations of cellulose and polyphenol in 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> were higher than in 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> when grasshoppers were present. The presence of polyphenol can affect food choices in some grasshoppers 
 <xref rid="pone.0083619-Dini1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Recent research also found the leaves of a plant population with lower tannin content were consumed by caterpillars more than those with higher tannin content, and caterpillar performance was higher on leaves with lower tannin content 
 <xref rid="pone.0083619-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Therefore, we suggest that elevated defense compounds in 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> decrease grasshopper performance, resulting in less leaf loss in 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic>. Note that when the grasshopper population was low, the lignin and cellulose concentrations in undamaged leaves of 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> were lower than damaged leaves. Implying that in damaged plants of 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic>, a leaf did not produce defense compounds until it was chewed by grasshoppers. Müller-Schärer et al. 
 <xref rid="pone.0083619-MllerSchrer1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> noted that high level of lignin reduced not only leaf palatability but also specific leaf area (SLA), one of the main determinants of the relative growth rate. In this study, we also found that leaf lignin concentration was negatively correlated with P
 <sub>max</sub> (R = 0.306, P&lt;0.05). Therefore, producing more lignin and cellulose might result in the growth rate of the whole plant decreasing more sharply. We propose that 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> might have adapted a strategy in which it can defend against herbivore, and reduce growth rate of itself as little as possible when the threat of herbivory is low.
