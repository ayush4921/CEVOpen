<p>Our results were consistent with the findings in Zas et al. 
 <xref rid="pone.0083619-Zas1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, which found that, compared to invasive plants, the capability of the native congener to respond to native insect damage was stronger. The weaker induced resistance of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> can contribute to its impaired competitiveness with 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> in the presence of the native generalist grasshoppers. Because our study was conducted in a closed system in which grasshoppers could not move freely to plants with lower induced resistance and higher palatability, we expect that the consequences would be further magnified in the field, where the two plants co-exist and where herbivores are not restricted.
