<p>After 16 weeks, the two plants in each aquarium developed into a single population and all leaves were intact, with no herbivore bite marks. The population densities of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> and 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> were 29.5±5.5 and 35.3±9.6 plants per square meter, respectively. Each aquarium was randomly assigned to one of three treatments- mild herbivory, severe herbivory, or control. Each species-treatment combination had six replicates. In the mild herbivore load group, we randomly picked out six aquaria of each species and put seven larvae of 
 <italic>A. sinensis</italic> in each aquarium. In the severe herbivore load group, six aquaria of each species were picked out randomly and each aquarium received twenty larvae of 
 <italic>A. sinensis</italic>. The last six aquaria of each species were used as controls. All aquaria were covered by white nylon web (mesh size: 1 mm
 <sup>2</sup>) throughout the experiment.
