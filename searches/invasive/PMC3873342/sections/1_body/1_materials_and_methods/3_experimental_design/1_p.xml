<p>This experiment was conducted at the National Field Station of Freshwater Ecosystem at Liangzi Lake, Hubei Province, China (30°50′–30°180′N, 114°210′–114°390′E). On April 23, 2012, 94 shoots of 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> and 77 shoots of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroide</italic> were cultivated in circular basins with sandy sediment and 5 cm of water. All shoots were approximately 10 cm long, with two nodes and three pairs of leaves. One week later, 36 plants of each species with similar height and weight (the mean heights were 13.21±1.09 cm and 12.71±1.02 cm; the mean fresh weights were 1.89±0.26 g and 1.00±0.16 g; and the mean lengths of roots were 3.4±0.65 cm and 4.3±0.84 cm for 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> and for 
 <italic>A. sessilis,</italic> respectively) were transferred to 36 aquaria (100 cm length × 50 cm width × 70 cm height) that were filled with 15 cm of fine-textured, homogeneous sediment soil. Two plants of one species were planted in each aquarium and all aquaria were placed on an outdoor, cement platform. The experimental systems were maintained daily, and the soil was saturated with water.
