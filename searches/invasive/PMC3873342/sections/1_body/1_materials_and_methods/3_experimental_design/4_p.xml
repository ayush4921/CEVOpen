<p>The next day, all grasshoppers were removed. All second and third pairs of leaves from the top of each plant were detached, dried at 70°C for more than 48 h, and stored at –20°C for chemical analyses. Lastly, the plants were harvested; the leaves, stems, and roots were separated, washed, and dried at 70°C for more than 48 h to determine the leaf biomass and total biomass of each population. Leaf nitrogen concentration based on mass (N
 <sub>mass</sub>) was determined using an element analyzer, Euro EA3000 (Euro Vector, Italy). Leaf polyphenolic concentrations were determined by the Folin-Ciocalteau method
