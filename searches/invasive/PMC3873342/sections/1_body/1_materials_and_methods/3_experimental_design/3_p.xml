<p>After 19 days, almost all leaves of the two species under severe herbivore load were gnawed by 
 <italic>A. sinensis</italic>, but the stems of the two species under both mild and severe herbivore load were still intact. Control plants had no herbivore bite marks. The net photosynthetic rate was determined using a Li-6400 Portable Photosynthesis System (Li-Cor, USA) under a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of natural light &gt;1700 µmol m
 <sup>–2</sup> s
 <sup>–1</sup> for either the second or the third pair of leaves from the top of each plant. The air temperature was moderate (25–30°C) and the relative humidity ranged from 60 to 70% between the hours of 11∶00 and 14∶00. We measured net photosynthetic rate on a single, undamaged leaf in each control aquarium and one undamaged and one herbivory damaged leaf in each mild herbivory treatment aquarium. In the severe herbivory treatment, we only measured damaged leaves because there were very few undamaged leaves. The leaves used for the photosynthesis measurements were marked and used for measuring the maximal quantum yield (Fv/Fm) using a DIVING-PAM (WALZ, Germany) between 20∶30 and 21∶00. Next, these leaves were detached, and the leaf area was measured using a Li-3100 Area Meter (Li-Cor, USA) to calculate the light-saturated photosynthetic rate per unit leaf area (P
 <sub>max</sub>).
