<p>All data including total biomass, leaf biomass, P
 <sub>max</sub>, Fv/Fm, and leaf nitrogen, lignin, cellulose and polyphenolic concentrations within the three herbivory treatments (except these traits for undamaged leaves at the mild herbivore load level) were analyzed with a factorial ANOVA assuming all effects (species, herbivory, and their interaction) as fixed factors, after testing for normality and homoscedasticity. Duncan tests were used to compare levels within factors for significance (P&lt;0.05). The differences in P
 <sub>max</sub>, Fv/Fm, and leaf nitrogen, lignin, cellulose and polyphenolic concentrations between damage and undamaged leaves under mild herbivore load were analyzed using a paired T Test. Polyphenolic concentration data were transformed using a Sqrt (x) function. All analyses were performed using SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
