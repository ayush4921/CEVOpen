 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic>, it cannot form tangled mats on the surface of a water body. 
 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> occurs in Bhutan, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Philippines, Sikkim, Thailand, and Vietnam. In China, it is distributed in most of the provinces south of the Yellow River

 <italic>A. sessilis</italic> shares the same phylogenetic history and has similar morphological traits and habitats to 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic>, it has often been used for comparisons with 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> in studies on invasion mechanisms
