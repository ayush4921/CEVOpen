 <italic>Pistia stratiotes</italic>) by a submerged one (
 <italic>E. densa</italic>), evaluating the implications of top-down vs bottom-up processes mediated by biological control efforts and nutrient loading, respectively. Their main message highlighted the risks associated with the adoption of control and eradication actions without planning active recovery interventions, as this lack may create opportunity windows for secondary invasions. Moreover,

 <italic>L. hexapetala</italic>, monitoring its relative growth rate and physiological traits in response to the exposition to root and leaf leachates of 
 <italic>L. peploides</italic>, 
 <italic>M. aquaticum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Mentha aquatica</italic>, finding complex allelopathic responses. Specifically, 
 <italic>L. hexapetala</italic> exibits a positive autoallelopathy which explains its invasiveness. In addition, they highlighted the risk of occurrence of potential invasional meltdown phenomena, with huge consequences on the local success of 
 <italic>L. hexapetala</italic>, and invasive 
 <italic>Ludwigia</italic> species in general.
