<p>However, beyond the characteristics of habitats and IAAPs, biological interactions—including competition, facilitation, invasional meltdown, and novel weapons—are also crucial for enlightening the IAAPs success. The study by

 <italic>Urochloa arrecta</italic> and the two native 
 <italic>Pontederia cordata</italic> and 
 <italic>Leersia hexandra</italic> performances in terms of biomass and plant length. In their manipulative experiment, they found that if 
 <italic>U. arrecta</italic> density increases (as number of fragments), the biomass and length of native species decrease substantially. However, the responses of the native species to the invader is species-specific, with differentiated biomass allocation behaviours.

 <italic>E. nuttallii</italic>, by modelling the temporal changes in water quality, and abundances of 
 <italic>E. nuttallii</italic> and of another critical invader, the quagga mussel, in a temperate shallow lake. They found that the dynamics of multi-invasion processes can be characterized by different, contrasting phases. After an initial mutual facilitation—as predicted by the invasional meltdown hypothesis—a strong space competition followed. This study offers a new mechanistic explanation of the typical boom-bust dynamics of invasive elodeids.
