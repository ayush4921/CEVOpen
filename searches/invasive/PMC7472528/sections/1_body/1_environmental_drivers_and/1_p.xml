<p>A key question is how IAAPs can progressively replace native counterparts. The invasive success of IAAPs depends in part on the characters of invaded ecosystems, as highlighted by

Furthermore, IAAPs invasion risk is expected to be boosted by climate change, as well as by increased nutrient availability, and it seems to be under the total control of future economic trends.
