<p>IAAPs can deeply alter the functioning of ecosystems.

 <italic>E. densa</italic> and 
 <italic>Lagarosiphon major</italic>, as they are capable to trigger huge stratification events for several key chemical parameters (O
 <sub>2</sub>, C, N), as recurrent hypoxia events. They confirmed that the spread of IAAPs involved a change in the metabolism of ecosystems, resulting in a net nutrient release towards the water column, concurrently with a net increase in carbon emission towards the atmosphere.
