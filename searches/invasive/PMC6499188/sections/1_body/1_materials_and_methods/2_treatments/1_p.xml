<p>We established 16 large-scale (12,000 m
 <sup>2</sup>) plots within four sites and 20 small-scale (1,000 m
 <sup>2</sup>) plots within six sites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Each plot was randomly assigned one treatment, such that all treatments were equally replicated (
 <italic>n</italic> = 9; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 4 for treatments applied at large scales and 
 <italic>n</italic> = 5 for treatments applied at small scales). Treatments were applied in only one plot per site (all treatments were not conducted at every small patch site due to space constraints and imazapyr permitting restrictions at some locations). Treatments were (1) summer imazapyr herbicide spray, (2) summer glyphosate herbicide spray, (3) fall glyphosate herbicide spray, and (4) untreated control. Due to space and logistical limitations, we were not able to include a fall imazapyr herbicide treatment. This treatment was less interesting to land managers that were consulted prior to experiment initiation (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Rohal et al., 2018</xref>). All herbicide treatments were followed by a winter mow. Plots were established in areas that had ≥75% 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> cover which had not been managed in the previous 5 years. 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> cover was not significantly different in small and large patches (paired 
 <italic>T</italic>-test: 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.39). Initial treatments were conducted in 2012, follow-up treatments conducted in 2013–2014, and monitoring continued in 2015–2016.
