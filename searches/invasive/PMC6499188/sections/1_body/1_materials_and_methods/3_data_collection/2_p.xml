<p>We selected the 16 innermost quadrats from the large patch plots in order to calculate plant community metrics that were comparable to the small-scale plots. Species richness was calculated for both scales at the plot level. Then, a mean coefficient of conservatism (mean 
 <italic>C</italic>) was calculated for each plot to estimate habitat quality. Coefficients of conservatism (CC) are expert-derived values that describe a plant speciesâ€™ disturbance tolerance or habitat specificity (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 2004</xref>). Species are assigned conservation values from 0 to 10, where species with the highest CC exhibit the least tolerance to human disturbance, while zeros represent exotic or invasive species. Mean 
 <italic>C</italic> is a robust metric frequently used to assess conservation value in wetlands (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Matthews et al., 2005</xref>). We calculated mean 
 <italic>C</italic> for all native species in each plot, using 
 <italic>C</italic>-values developed for other Western states that were evaluated for suitability in Utah (
