<p>At both scales, we monitored vegetation annually in September 2013–2016 after the fall herbicide treatments had been conducted. Pre-treatment monitoring occurred in June 2012 before the initial summer herbicide treatments were implemented. In the small patches, vegetation was sampled along four permanent, evenly spaced transects, within four, evenly spaced 1 m
 <sup>2</sup> quadrats placed to the right of each transect. In the large patches, vegetation was sampled along two permanent, evenly spaced transects, with two 1 m
 <sup>2</sup> quadrats placed on either side of each transect at 10 evenly-spaced locations. We determined percent cover by ocular estimation in each 1 m
 <sup>2</sup> quadrat using cover classes (&lt;1%, 1–5%, 6–25%, 26–50%, 51–75%, and 76–100%). Percent cover estimations were made by the same two individuals following a coordination test to ensure similar estimations. We identified plants to species level (
