<p>We drew a 1000-m buffer (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Matthews et al., 2009</xref>) around each plot from which we collected additional anthropogenic disturbance and land-use information. Landscape-level disturbances such as human development, roads, and agriculture have been correlated with plant invasions and other plant community changes in other wetlands (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Chambers et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">Tousignant et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Menuz and Kettenring, 2013</xref>). Within each buffer, we determined the length of roads and canals which were hand digitized using high resolution (0.5 m resolution) aerial imagery collected in June 2016. We overlaid each buffer with water diversion data, sourced from the Utah Division of Water Rights, to determine the number of water diversions in each 1000 m radius surrounding each plot. Water diversions, roads (often associated with dikes), and canals represented the degree of hydrologic manipulation in the surrounding region. We determined the proportion of agriculture, developed land, open water, and emergent wetlands within each 1000 m buffer using the National Land Cover Dataset.
