<p>Variables related to the vegetation matrix are correlates for dispersal of propagules entering the plot. Plots with high levels of 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> cover in the matrix should be expected to receive high levels of propagule pressure influencing further 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> invasion (
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">Simberloff, 2009</xref>), while plots surrounded by high levels of native species should have more native propagules available to assemble (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Palmer et al., 1997</xref>). Long distance dispersal (particularly for water-transported seed like many of Utah’s native wetland species) may be disrupted by other factors, such as man-made impoundments and water control structures (
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">Soomers et al., 2013</xref>). Around the small plots, we collected data on the surrounding vegetation matrix of each plot in summer 2013. We expected the vegetation in these areas to remain relatively stable year-to-year in the absence of disturbance. We placed 12 1 m
 <sup>2</sup> quadrats at even intervals 7 m outside of the plot edge, and collected cover data for each species using the same cover classes used within plots. Around the large plots, we used high resolution 4-band (RGB–red, blue, green, + NIR–near infrared) aerial imagery collected in the summer of 2013 to determine the vegetation composition at 12 even intervals 7 m from the edge of each plot. Our analysis determined that each large plot was surrounded by 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> monocultures, which was confirmed during site visits.
