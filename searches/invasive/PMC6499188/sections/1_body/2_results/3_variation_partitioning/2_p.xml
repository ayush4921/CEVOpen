<p>Management explained almost 10% of the variation for 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> cover, but was not a significant variable for any other response (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Fall herbicide treatments resulted in less 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> cover than summer treatments, but type of herbicide was not significant (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table S6</xref>).
