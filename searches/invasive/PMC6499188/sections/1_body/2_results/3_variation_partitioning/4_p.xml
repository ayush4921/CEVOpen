<p>Landscape variables were significant for each plant community outcome, and uniquely explained ∼7–13% of variation in native perennials and species richness. Plots with high amounts of hydrologic disturbance in the landscape (high levels of landscape PCA1) had lower levels of species richness and perennial cover, while those that had high amounts of perennial natives in the surrounding landscape had high cover of native perennials and greater species richness (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Landscape variables also accounted for nearly half of the explained variation in 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> cover (∼16%) (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Plots with higher levels of hydrologic disturbance and with a smaller proportion of emergent marsh in the surrounding landscape had higher covers of 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The RDA biplot with significant landscape variables overlaid reflected these results. Plots that were more dominated by 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> were associated with higher levels of hydrologic disturbance in the landscape (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). More species rich wetland plant communities were associated with greater amounts of native perennials in the landscape.
