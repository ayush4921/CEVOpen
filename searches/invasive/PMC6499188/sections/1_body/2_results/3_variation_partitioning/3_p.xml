<p>Abiotic variables were consistently the most important unique variable explaining variation in plant community responses (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Deeper hydrology (higher values of abiotic PCA1) had a negative influence on native perennials, species richness, and mean 
 <italic>C</italic> (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table S6</xref>). The RDA biplot with the abiotic principal component overlaid showed patterns that reflected these results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Sites with low scores along the first axis were dominated by a few species with lower habitat value that could tolerate deep flooding including 
 <italic>Lemna</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Typha</italic> spp., and 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>. Sites with high scores along the first axis were associated with more diverse species assemblages, and organized by more drought tolerant species (i.e., 
 <italic>Salicornia rubra</italic> and 
 <italic>Hordeum jubatum</italic>) associated with high scores on axis 2, and more obligate wetland species (i.e., 
 <italic>Eleocharis palustris</italic> and 
 <italic>Bidens cernua</italic>) with low scores on axis 2.
