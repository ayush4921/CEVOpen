<p>Scale was a significant variable in explaining variation in each plant community outcome, but the amount of variation scale alone explained was minimal (&lt;5%) (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). For each univariate plant community outcome, the combined influence of scale and abiotic factors explained ∼14–38% of variation. Scale in combination with both landscape and abiotic variables explained 23% of variation for mean 
 <italic>C</italic> and 11% of variation for native perennial cover (
