<p>The reduction of abiotic variables resulted in two retained principal components that explained 69.1% of the variation in abiotic factors among patches (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). PC axis 1 loaded heavily on water depth variables and organic horizon depth, which generally is higher with deeper and prolonged flooding (
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">Reddy and DeLaune, 2008</xref>). This axis primarily represented a hydrologic gradient from drier conditions to deeper water conditions. This axis also represented a gradient from low to high salinity. PC axis 2 loaded most heavily on phosphorus and nitrogen and primarily represented a nutrient gradient.
