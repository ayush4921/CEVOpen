<p>Stepwise variable selection retained abiotic PCA1 (describing plot hydrology) for three response variables; the factors in abiotic PCA1 had a significant negative effect on species richness, mean 
 <italic>C</italic>, and percent cover of native perennials (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Abiotic PCA2 (nutrients) was not selected in variable selection for any response variable. Landscape PCA1 (describing landscape hydrologic disturbance) was retained in all models except mean 
 <italic>C</italic>; the factors in PCA1 had a negative influence on species richness and native perennial cover and a positive influence on 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> cover. Percent cover surrounding natives had a significant positive effect on all response variables except 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Landscape PCA2 was only significant for the plant community model. The proportion of emergent marsh in the surrounding area had a positive effect on species richness and a negative effect on 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> cover, though this effect was only moderately significant. Herbicide season was significant for both 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> and mean 
 <italic>C</italic> models, while herbicide type was not significant in all models. Spatial scale was selected and significant in all models except for the plant community analysis. The direction of spatial effects indicated that smaller plots had higher species richness, mean 
 <italic>C</italic>, and native perennial cover, and lower 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> cover than the large plots (
