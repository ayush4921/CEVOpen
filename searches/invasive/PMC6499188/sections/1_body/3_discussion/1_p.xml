 <italic>Phragmites</italic> is known to be one of the most problematic wetland invaders in North America (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Galatowitsch et al., 1999</xref>) and is heavily managed (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Martin and Blossey, 2013</xref>), yet little is known about how the size and environmental context of managed patches can influence 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> management outcomes (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Hazelton et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">Quirion et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, we found that herbicide treatments led to more consistently successful outcomes in small patches compared with large ones. Over a 5-year management timeline, 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> reinvaded more slowly, and native perennial plants established at higher covers in the small patches. Like other studies that have evaluated patch scale influence on assembling communities (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">Ricketts, 2001</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Holl and Crone, 2004</xref>), we found the scale of the treated patch alone accounted for very little of the variation in plant community responses. However, scale jointly with abiotic and/or landscape factors explained large amounts of variation in 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> and native plant responses following management. Specifically, large patches often had deeper and more prolonged flooding than small patches, which had a negative influence on the cover, conservation value, and richness of native plants. Large patches were also often in areas with more landscape-scale hydrologic disturbance, which promoted 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> reinvasion and had a negative influence on the cover and habitat quality of returning native species. Small patches were more often surrounded by a matrix of native perennial species, which had a positive influence on native plant recovery. For the most successful outcomes, managers should focus 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> treatments on patches with shallow flooding, less hydrologic disturbance, and more native species in the surrounding matrix.
