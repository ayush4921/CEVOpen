<p>Hydrology, specifically flooding depth, duration, and frequency, is known to be a factor of overriding influence in determining plant community assembly in wetlands (
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">Reddy and DeLaune, 2008</xref>). Thus, our finding that hydrologic variables were the leading driver of plant community outcomes is not surprising and confirms similar findings in other wetlands (e.g., 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Matthews et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">Tousignant et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">Tsai et al., 2012</xref>). Like others studying arid wetlands (
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">Tsai et al., 2012</xref>), we found that greater water depth and increased organic horizons (associated with prolonged flooding) negatively influenced species richness and native perennial cover. Shallowly flooded or mudflat conditions that promote a more diverse suite of wetland plant germination syndromes (
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Kadlec, 1983</xref>) were more common in the small patches, where we recorded greater numbers of species and covers of native perennials. Deep and prolonged flooding in the large patches also negatively influenced the conservation value of the returning species. 
 <italic>Typha</italic>, a species with low conservation value and considered a wetland invader in many ecosystems, was the most dominant emergent plant beyond 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> that returned to large, more deeply flooded patches. Like 
 <italic>Phragmites, Typha</italic> is more tolerant of deeply flooded conditions than many native species (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Kercher and Zedler, 2004</xref>). Hydrologic shifts that lead to deep and prolonged flooding often favor invasive species that are more broadly tolerant of these altered conditions (
