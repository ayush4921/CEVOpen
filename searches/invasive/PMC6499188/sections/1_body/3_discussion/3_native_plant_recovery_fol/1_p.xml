<p>Despite minimal quantitative evidence of plant community outcomes following

 <italic>Phragmites</italic> managers often assume that conditions will be adequate for native plant recruitment following management (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Rohal et al., 2018</xref>). However, we saw variable levels of native plant return following management efforts, with consistently greater covers of native perennial plants and higher species richness in small patches than large (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). The size of the patch alone accounted for very little of this variation in plant communities. While scale-based ecological processes like differing spatial heterogeneity and edge to area ratios were likely still at play (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Englund and Cooper, 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Holl and Crone, 2004</xref>), they were less important relative to abiotic and landscape factors at the temporal scale of this study. Spatial scale in combination with abiotic conditions (predominantly hydrology) explained the most variation for each measured plant community response.
