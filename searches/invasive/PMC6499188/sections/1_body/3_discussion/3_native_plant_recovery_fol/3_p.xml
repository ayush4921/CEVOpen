<p>Still, others have found that dispersal and seed availability are more limiting than abiotic conditions in wetland plant assembly (
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">Zobel et al., 2000</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Kettenring and Galatowitsch, 2011a</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>), suggesting seed availability might also be limiting the plant community responses we observed. Even in more deeply flooded sites, the heterogeneity we observed in water depth was substantial, which indicates that there were enough germination opportunities to expect greater richness and covers of perennial wetland species than what we observed. For example, three bulrush species (
 <italic>Schoenoplectus americanus, S. acutus</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. maritimus</italic>) that are the dominant perennial species in GSL (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Downard et al., 2017</xref>) all have superior germination in 5–10 cm of water (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Clevering, 1995</xref>), conditions that were met in all but the most deeply flooded sites. If these species were readily available in the seed bank, we would expect to see them take advantage of microsites, yet we observed minimal recruitment, possibly because the densities of invaded seed banks rarely match uninvaded areas (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Gioria and Pyšek, 2015</xref>). While seed banks under 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> stands are diverse in tidal systems (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Baldwin et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Hazelton et al., 2018</xref>), this may not be the case in inland systems, particularly where hydrologic connectivity between wetlands has been disrupted.
