<p>Invasive plant experiments are often conducted at small (&lt;1 m
 <sup>2</sup>) scales which can limit their applicability to real-world restorations (

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Erskine Ogden and Rejm√°nek (2005)</xref>, we found that the results we observed at a smaller scale did not translate to large-scale efforts, particularly regarding native plant recovery after invader removal. These results highlight the importance of having an experimental arena that reflect the common scales of management (

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Brudvig et al., 2017</xref>) to conduct restoration research across many sites with diverse abiotic, historic, and landscape contexts to better understand the contingencies of restoration outcomes. Partnerships between researchers and managers can enable investigation at the necessary spatial and temporal scales to elucidate such constraints (
