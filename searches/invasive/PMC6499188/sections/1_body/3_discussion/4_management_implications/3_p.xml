<p>Often the management of large patches of invasive species is prioritized because of political reasons (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">Palmer, 2009</xref>), feasibility (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Larson et al., 2011</xref>), and site-specific concerns (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">McGeoch et al., 2016</xref>). Should practitioners choose to manage large patches of 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>, our results suggest they should then plan for the additional constraints that are likely associated with such patches. Particularly for large patches that are isolated from intact native species, or subject to hydrologic disturbance that might limit native species dispersal, managers should consider including active revegetation in management plans, which can help overcome propagule limitations (

 <italic>Phragmites</italic> reinvasion (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Byun et al., 2015</xref>). If hydrologic control is an option, our research suggests promoting a more natural hydrologic pattern instead of moderately deep and prolonged flooding, which can promote more native species germination. However, managers should be cautious that these conditions might also promote 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> germination (
