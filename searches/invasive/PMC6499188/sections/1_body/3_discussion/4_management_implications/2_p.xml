<p>Multiple ecological models have supported recommendations for managers to target small, outlier patches of invasive species, which most efficiently reduces invader spread and is more cost effective (

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Higgins et al., 2000</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">Taylor and Hastings, 2004</xref>). One 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>-specific model offered evidence that prioritizing small patches of 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> is more effective for reducing spread (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Alminagorta Cabezas, 2015</xref>), explained by 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>â€™ ability to rapidly expand vegetatively (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Kettenring et al., 2016</xref>), and the larger edge to area ratios of small patches. Regardless, large patches of 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> are often targeted, though this may not be the best method to reduce 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> cover at the landscape scale. For example, one 6-year 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> monitoring effort showed that the reduction of 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> cover from the herbicide treatment of large patches (&gt;5 acres) was offset by rapid expansion of untreated small patches (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Myers et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, our study, like 
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">Quirion et al. (2018)</xref>, provides evidence that large patches of 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> might also be more challenging to manage effectively, and may result in lower recruitment of native plants. Our research provides further context, suggesting that it is not the scale of the patch, 
 <italic>per se</italic>, that controls outcomes, but the abiotic and landscape factors that correspond with patch scale that drive plant community results. Thus, to maximize plant community results, managers should target small 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> patches in less disturbed areas, with substantial established native communities in the matrix (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Long et al., 2017b</xref>). With limited resources, choosing less degraded sites (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">Reid et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">Prior et al., 2017</xref>) with a matrix dominated by desirable native species (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Matthews et al., 2017</xref>) allows managers to maximize the success of their efforts (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Holl and Aide, 2011</xref>).
