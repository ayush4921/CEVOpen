<p>While managers seek to refine management practices to achieve restoration goals, it is often factors outside of management decision-making, like site, landscape, or historical contingencies that drive plant community outcomes (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Brudvig, 2011</xref>). In this study, management choices about herbicide type and timing were less important than landscape and abiotic factors for explaining differences in 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> cover and native plant recovery following treatments. Nevertheless, while herbicide type was insignificant, fall herbicide timing did result in less 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> cover and led to more consistent results across scales than summer treatments. Fall treatments were superior for 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> removal likely because herbicide is more effectively translocated to rhizomes in the fall as 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> prepares for senescence (
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">Tu et al., 2001</xref>). While fall treatments released more opportunities for native establishment by more effectively removing 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>, herbicide timing did not explain much variation in plant community responses. Although we did not see a strong signal for management decisions on plant community outcomes in this study, we caution that management decisions may still have important consequences in other contexts. We chose management methods that we expected would be effective, following consultations with experienced land managers and a review of previous research (
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Rohal et al., 2018</xref>). Had we included less appropriate management actions, such as manual removal without herbicide, we may have seen greater variability in plant community outcomes, and a stronger signal for management.
