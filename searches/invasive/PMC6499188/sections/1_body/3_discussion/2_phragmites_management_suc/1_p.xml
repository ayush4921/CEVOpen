<p>Invasive species reinvasion following management efforts is common, and has been attributed to variable environmental conditions, invader propagule pressure, native plant recruitment limitations, or ineffective treatments (
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">Pearson et al., 2016</xref>). Patch scale can also have implications for invasive species reinvasion patterns. Mirroring our results, another recent study found 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> herbicide management most effective at smaller scales (
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">Quirion et al., 2018</xref>), though they found the best 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> cover reduction in patches less than 1 m
 <sup>2</sup>, far smaller than our 1000 m
 <sup>2</sup> small patches. 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> reinvasion, particularly following management of large patches (&gt;5 acres), is a common observation among managers (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Myers et al., 2009</xref>). We found that patch size alone accounted for a small amount of variation (&lt;5%) in 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> cover, likely explained by the different modes of follow-up herbicide treatment at the different scales (machine herbicide spraying in large patches vs. more precise and less destructive backpack spraying in small patches). But most of the variation in 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> cover that we observed was from abiotic conditions and landscape influences, factors which often corresponded with patch scale.
