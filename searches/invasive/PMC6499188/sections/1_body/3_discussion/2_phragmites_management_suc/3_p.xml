<p>The environmental factors and processes that lead to the creation of large, expansive 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> patches are explored in the literature, but are poorly understood (

 <italic>Phragmites</italic> patch expansion rates and patch dynamics are highly variable across its range (reviewed in 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Kettenring et al., 2016</xref>), indicating that the creation of large patches is not just a function of time since invasion, but may also be influenced by other variables, such as environmental factors, propagule pressure, and disturbance histories. It is often suggested that site hydrology may play an important role (

 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Kettenring et al., 2016</xref>). Given the stark differences in hydrology that we observed in the small and large patches, we hypothesize that it may be altered hydrologic patterns [specifically prolonged flooding (&lt;0.5 m) through the growing season] that most enable the rapid patch expansion and the creation of large patches. This study highlights that these conditions, in turn, can limit restoration outcomes.
