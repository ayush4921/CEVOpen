 <italic>Phragmites</italic> can withstand a wide range of salinity, hydrologic, and nutrient conditions (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Eller et al., 2017</xref>), but treatments may not be equally effective across environmental gradients (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Rohal, 2018</xref>). In this study, abiotic conditions in combination with scale accounted for a large amount of the variation in 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> cover following treatments. This result was largely explained by the differences in flooding observed across patch scales, with deeper water and larger organic horizons observed in large-scale plots (e.g., average water depth for large patches was 17.5 cm compared with 2.6 cm for small patches). 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> herbicide management is most effective when soil moisture is high, since drought-stressed 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> does not effectively translocate herbicides to the roots (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Carlson et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Rohal et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Rohal, 2018</xref>). But water depth, particularly after management treatments cease, likely plays an important part in the competitive dynamics between 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> and other native species. For example, fewer plant competitors can withstand deeper water, thus increasing light resource availability and increasing ecosystem susceptibility to invasion (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Davis et al., 2000</xref>). Established 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> is highly tolerant of inundation, while many native species cannot withstand these conditions (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Brix et al., 1992</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Eller et al., 2017</xref>). Flooding (&gt;3.5 cm) is known to inhibit 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> seed germination (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Baldwin et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Kettenring et al., 2015</xref>), but also can limit the germination of many native wetland plants (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Leck, 2003</xref>). Those patches that had deeper flooding likely saw an expansion of the remaining 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> through rhizomes due to clonal integration (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Amsberry et al., 2000</xref>), with limited recruitment of 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> by seed, but also limited recruitment of native species. Lower native plant recruitment likely also limited the biotic resistance to 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> expansion (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Byun et al., 2015</xref>), which in turn may have contributed to the higher amounts of 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> observed in the large flooded patches. Very deep flooding (&gt;0.5 m) can restrict 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> growth (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Hudon et al., 2005</xref>), but the depth of flooding we measured (the deepest plots rarely exceeded 30 cm) did not limit 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> expansion after herbicide treatments ceased.
