 <italic>Phragmites</italic> is a high nutrient specialist (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Mozdzer et al., 2010</xref>); with plentiful nutrients it can produce more above-ground biomass (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Minchinton and Bertness, 2003</xref>), greater numbers of florets and inflorescences (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Kettenring et al., 2011</xref>), and explosive seedling growth (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Kettenring and Whigham, 2018</xref>). Contrary to our expectations, soil nutrients did not explain any of the variation in 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> reinvasion following management. Our one-time measurements of soil nutrients likely did not capture temporal and spatial variation in nutrient dynamics or all the different forms of nitrogen important to 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> growth (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Mozdzer et al., 2010</xref>), which may have been more important in explaining vegetation dynamics. High salinity can also constrain 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> growth (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Burdick et al., 2001</xref>), and may have an influence on treatment effectiveness when elevated, but the salinities observed in our treatment plots were well within its tolerance limits (
