<p>Landscape level disturbances are widely considered factors that can promote plant invasions (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Menuz and Kettenring, 2013</xref>), particularly in wetlands that are landscape sinks (
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">Zedler and Kercher, 2004</xref>). Our findings indicate that some landscape-scale disturbances, such as hydrologic disturbances from roads and canals associated with man-made impoundments can also promote the reinvasion of 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> following management. Landscape factors associated with disturbance to a wetlandâ€™s natural hydrology, including shoreline alterations, dredging, and diking, are often implicated in promoting invasions (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Galatowitsch et al., 1999</xref>), and have been linked to 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> invasions (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Chambers et al., 1999</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Restrictions to natural hydrology may create lower salinities than unaltered wetlands, which can promote 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> presence (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Burdick et al., 2001</xref>). Impoundments and water alterations also likely contributed to the deeper and longer duration flooding that can contribute to 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> competitive dominance (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Brix et al., 1992</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Galatowitsch et al., 1999</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Kercher and Zedler, 2004</xref>). Despite the possible negative implications, impoundments have enormous benefits for buffering GSL wetlands from drought, since water availability is limited by widespread upstream urban and agricultural uses (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Downard and Endter-Wada, 2013</xref>). Water control associated with such impoundments can often assist 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> management efforts by allowing for increased equipment access (
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Rohal et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, water control may allow for the manipulation of a hydrologic regime that could favor native species over 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>, though this has been unexplored empirically.
