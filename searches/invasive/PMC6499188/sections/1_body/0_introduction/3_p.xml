<p>It is often recognized that treatments enacted at small scales can be more effective at invader removal (
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">Quirion et al., 2018</xref>) and result in more robust native plant recovery (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Erskine Ogden and Rejmánek, 2005</xref>) than large-scale efforts. Larger scale treatments may have to be conducted with different methods than smaller patches (e.g., resource intensive methods such as manual removal of invasive plants are typically infeasible at large scales) which can have implications for success (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Kettenring and Adams, 2011</xref>). The patch scale can also influence plant assembly processes following management treatments. The spatial heterogeneity of biotic and abiotic conditions within a patch is likely to increase with increasing patch area, leading to greater opportunities for a diversity of species recruitment in larger patches (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">De Blois et al., 2002</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Englund and Cooper, 2003</xref>). A patch’s size might also influence its degree of openness (edge-to-area ratio), which can impact its permeability to the exchange of organisms (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Englund and Cooper, 2003</xref>). Small patches that have a higher edge to interior ratio might be more influenced by propagules or clonal growth from the surrounding matrix and edge-mediated environmental conditions (e.g., light intensity) that influence plant community assembly patterns (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">Phillips and Shure, 1990</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">De Blois et al., 2002</xref>). The unique impact of patch size on community assembly is challenging to distinguish from the local and landscape factors that can co-occur with patch scale (

 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">Pauchard and Shea, 2006</xref>). The abiotic environment of a patch can differ with its scale, in turn influencing species assembly (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">Phillips and Shure, 1990</xref>). In addition, landscape-scale disturbance factors that can enable the formation of large invaded patches (
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">Zedler and Kercher, 2004</xref>) might then constrain the assembling plant community following management treatments (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Ehrenfeld, 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">Tousignant et al., 2010</xref>).
