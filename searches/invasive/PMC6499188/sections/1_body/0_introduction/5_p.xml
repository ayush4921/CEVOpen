<p>Given the widespread nature of the 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> invasion and limited resources for restoration, managers must often prioritize sites, often choosing between targeting the large stands where the impacts appear most severe or focusing on the initial patches, which can spread rapidly (

 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Hazelton et al., 2014</xref>). 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> managers must also select patches across heterogeneous abiotic conditions, which can impact treatment success (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Rohal, 2018</xref>). And they must select patches within a diverse landscape, with different matrix vegetation and varying levels of landscape-scale disturbances (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Long et al., 2017b</xref>). These abiotic and landscape influences may have contributed to 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>â€™ presence and therefore might further restrict restoration outcomes (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Hazelton et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Long et al., 2017a</xref>). Furthermore, managers must select the appropriate management action, which most commonly involves herbicide, primarily due to its cost-effectiveness (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Martin and Blossey, 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Rohal et al., 2018</xref>). Manual methods such as burning and mowing that do not kill roots and rhizomes are not effective without the addition of herbicide, and biological control is presently unavailable (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Hazelton et al., 2014</xref>). Managers must choose the timing of herbicide application, commonly in summer or fall, and the type of herbicide: imazapyr, or glyphosate (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Hazelton et al., 2014</xref>). Spray timing and the composition of herbicide can have different effectiveness regarding 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> dieback and non-target native plant impacts (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Mozdzer et al., 2008</xref>). Knowing the degree to which 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> management choices, patch scale, local abiotic factors, and landscape factors might independently and jointly influence restoration outcomes can help managers focus on the most influential factors constraining success. While restoration research often focuses on management and site level abiotic factors, an understanding of how these factors interact with patch scale and landscape factors to influence restoration outcomes is relatively unexplored (
