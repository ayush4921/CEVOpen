 <italic>Phragmites australis</italic> (Cav.) Trin ex Steud (i.e., common reed, hereafter called 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>) is a widespread invasive plant present in wetlands across North America (
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Saltonstall, 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Kettenring et al., 2012</xref>) that is often the target of restoration efforts (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Martin and Blossey, 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Rohal et al., 2018</xref>). The impacts of 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> to plant biodiversity (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Chambers et al., 1999</xref>), wildlife habitat quality (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Dibble et al., 2013</xref>), and ecosystem functioning (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Findlay et al., 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">Rooth et al., 2003</xref>) have led managers to spend large sums of money and time on its management (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Martin and Blossey, 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Rohal et al., 2018</xref>). With the capacity to reproduce both sexually and asexually (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Kettenring and Mock, 2012</xref>), 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> invades wetlands by colonizing new areas from seed or rhizome fragments, which can then rapidly expand through clonal growth (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Amsberry et al., 2000</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Kettenring et al., 2016</xref>). A disturbance specialist (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Minchinton and Bertness, 2003</xref>), 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> often becomes established following a (small-scale) disturbance in a wetland (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Kettenring et al., 2015</xref>), and expands most rapidly following additional disturbance to the vegetation matrix or hydrologic drawdowns (
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">Warren et al., 2001</xref>). These processes can create a pattern across the landscape of small patches surrounded by remnant native vegetation intermixed with large-scale stands where patches have expanded and merged to form large monocultures (
