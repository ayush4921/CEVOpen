<p>Invasive plants can reduce the abundance and diversity of native plant communities, and can markedly alter ecosystem functions and services, making invasive plant management a restoration priority (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Hejda et al., 2009</xref>). It is often assumed that desirable species will naturally recover once the invader is removed (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Galatowitsch et al., 1999</xref>), but this is rarely the case (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Kettenring and Adams, 2011</xref>). Restoration outcomes are notoriously variable across sites, and can be very challenging to predict (

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Brudvig et al., 2017</xref>). But clearly understanding the constraints to restoration success is important in order to prioritize sites for invasive species management that are most likely to have successful outcomes (i.e., effective removal of the invader and native plant recovery), or to plan for the additional efforts needed to overcome thresholds at sites that have a high degree of impairment (
