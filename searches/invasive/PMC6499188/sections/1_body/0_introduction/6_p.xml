<p>Here we investigate the plant community outcomes of three different 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> management regimes (summer glyphosate, summer imazapyr, and fall glyphosate) at two discrete spatial scales (small 1000 m
 <sup>2</sup> patches representing initial invasions, and large 12,000 m
 <sup>2</sup> patches representing large stands). These three herbicide timings were chosen based on manager suggestions of the most logistically feasible treatments (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Rohal et al., 2018</xref>) and the restoration ecology literature that indicated that these treatments might be most successful (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Ailstock et al., 2001</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Mozdzer et al., 2008</xref>). We asked, does the scale at which a treatment is conducted influence (1) 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> cover, (2) native perennial plant cover, and (3) species richness of the returning plant community? And is this effect (or lack of effect) consistent over a typical 5-year management time frame? We also sought to understand the influence of patch scale and management choices in relation to other factors known to influence assembling plant communities, specifically their local abiotic and landscape contexts. Using variance partitioning, we asked: what is the relative influence of patch scale, management, local abiotic factors, and landscape factors on assembling plant communities following 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> management? Are the differences we see in plant community outcomes at different spatial scales attributable to the patch scale alone? Or are there abiotic and landscape factors that are associated with patch scale that influence different plant community responses?
