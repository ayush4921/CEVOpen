 <caption> RDA of the plant community from 2015 with the significant landscape variables overlaid. Large plots are marked by black dots. Small plots are marked by open white dots. The RDA vectors are PCA.1_HydroDist: Landscape PCA 1 representing nearby hydrologic disturbances like canals and impoundments; PCA.2_DevDisturbance: Landscape PCA2 representing nearby disturbance from nearby human developments; SurVegNative: percent cover of native perennial species in the surrounding vegetation of each plot. For species codes, refer to Figure 5. </caption>
