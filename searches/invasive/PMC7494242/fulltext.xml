Because of the potential for enemy release of invasive nonnative plant species from species-specific soil pathogens, invasive plants may be able to shift ranges more readily than native plant species. Additionally, changing climatic conditions may alter soil microbial functioning, affecting plant&#x02013;microbe interactions. We evaluated the effects of site, plant&#x02013;soil microbe interactions, altered climate, and their interactions on the growth and germination of three congeneric shrub species, two native to southern and central Florida (<italic>Eugenia foetida</italic> and <italic>E. axillaris</italic>), and one nonnative invasive from south America (<italic>E. uniflora</italic>). We measured germination and biomass for these plant species in growth chambers grown under live and sterile soils from two sites within their current range, and one site in their expected range, simulating current (2010) and predicted future (2050) spring growing season temperatures in the new range. Soil microbes (microscopic bacteria, fungi, viruses and other organisms) had a net negative effect on the invasive plant, <italic>E. uniflora</italic>, across all sites and temperature treatments. This negative response to soil microbes suggests that <italic>E. uniflora</italic>&#x02019;s invasive success and potential for range expansion are due to other contributing factors, e.g. higher germination and growth relative to native <italic>Eugenia</italic>. The effect of soil microbes on the native species depended on the geographic provenance of the microbes, and this may influence range expansion of these native species.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser"><p>Species ranges are expected to shift in response to climate change; however, it is unclear how species interactions will affect range shifts.

Climate change varies around the world and concomitant ecological responses are likely to differ by region (<xref rid="CIT0077" ref-type="bibr">Walther <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>). During the past century, average annual global temperatures for land and ocean surfaces have increased at a rate near 0.6 &#x000b0;C/century; however, the trend has been three times greater since 1976, with some of the largest increases in temperature occurring in the high latitudes (<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">NOAA Satellite and Information Service 2009</xref>). As the climate changes, most species have been shifting their ranges poleward, or upward on mountains (<xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Parmesan and Yohe 2003</xref>); however, species vary in their ability to shift their ranges (<xref rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr">Sorte <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). Growing evidence suggests that biotic interactions play key roles in species response to climate change (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Guo <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). Specifically, the study of above- and below-ground biotic interactions are important to consider in relation to plant range expansion with climate change (<xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">van der Putten <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). In a literature review of over 600 papers, <xref rid="CIT0074" ref-type="bibr">Tylianakis <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> revealed that climate change influences virtually every type of biotic interaction, yet biotic interactions are rarely incorporated into models of organismal response to climate change (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Gilman <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Gilman <italic>et al</italic>. (2010)</xref> stressed the importance of assessing the potential effects of novel interactions precipitated by climate change, suggesting that assessing species demographic responses to interactions with species beyond current range boundaries would improve our ability to understand species range-expanding capacities.</p><p>Soil microbial communities comprise symbionts and decomposers, which generally results in positive plant soil feedbacks (PSF) (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Ehrenfeld <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>) as well as soil pathogens, which result in negative PSF (<xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">Reinhart and Callaway 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Morris <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Kulmatiski <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). Nonnative plant species may be able to expand their ranges more readily than native species because they may have fewer enemies (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Klironomos 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Hawkes <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>) when compared with their native range [&#x02018;enemy release hypothesis&#x02019; (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Keane and Crawley 2002</xref>)], maintain the ability to form positive mycorrhizal interactions in their new ranges (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Callaway <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>), receive greater positive impacts in the new range than the native range [&#x02018;enhanced mutualism hypothesis&#x02019; (<xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">Reinhart and Callaway 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Callaway <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>)], reduce local symbionts (<xref rid="CIT0069" ref-type="bibr">Stinson <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0076" ref-type="bibr">Vogelsang and Bever 2009</xref>), alter secondary metabolites (<xref rid="CIT0078" ref-type="bibr">Wardle <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>) and nutrient dynamics in new ranges (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Kourtev <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">von Holle <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). Specifically, nonnative plant species may be able to expand their ranges more readily than native species because they encounter fewer co-evolved root pathogens, the absence of which may allow greater colonization by generalist mycorrhizal fungi in their new ranges, benefitting invasive plants (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Beckstead and Parker 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">van Grunsven <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Hawkes <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). Additionally, soil biota may not be able to shift their ranges as quickly as plant species can (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Berg <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>), which may have strong effects on the potential for both native and nonnative plant range expansion and community composition (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">van Grunsven <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Engelkes <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">van Grunsven <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>).</p><p>Warming is expected to benefit plant&#x02013;mycorrhizal interactions and nutrient cycling, which will affect plant nutritional status as well as aboveground plant&#x02013;insect interactions (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Koricheva <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). Microbial responses to warming can be short-lived (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Balser <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>), potentially due to changes in microbial community composition, substrate availability, altered litter quality, or physiological adjustments of the soil biota (<xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">Pritchard 2011</xref>). Soil warming has been found to promote soil microbial activity, net nitrification rates, P and N mineralization rates and total respiration in soil (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Andresen <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). In a meta-analysis of mycorrhizal response to global change, warming increased mycorrhizal fungal abundance in 63 % of the studies, whereas mycorrhizal activity decreased in 71 % of the studies (<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Mohan <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). It is expected that the activity and abundance of soil pathogens will increase with rising temperatures because their life cycles will be shortened (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Bragazza <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). While there is strong evidence for an increase in aboveground plant pathogens with warming, little is known about the effects of warming on below-ground pathogens and their effects on natural plant populations (<xref rid="CIT0075" ref-type="bibr">Van der Putten <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>).</p><p>Our research addressed the question of whether nonnative species will be better potential range-expanders than native species because of their propensity to have less negative plant&#x02013;soil microbial interactions, or a net positive interactions with microbes, after invading a new area (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Diez <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). We hypothesized that the ability of nonnative species to expand their range would be greater than native species, because of their ability to form positive generalist associations with soil biota and the likelihood that they will escape species-specific soil enemies (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Hawkes 2007</xref>). Further, we predicted that nonnative species would have net positive associations with soil biota, and that these positive associations will increase outside their range, with plant&#x02013;microbe interactions more positive in their new range than in their current range (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Callaway and Aschehoug 2000</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Diez <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). Additionally, we assessed whether plant&#x02013;soil microbe interactions for a nonnative species are affected by climate change. We expected that warming would enhance nonnative plant growth, and that the effect of warming on plant growth would be enhanced by plant&#x02013;microbe interactions because there would be fewer negative interactions from co-evolved soil pathogens outside of its current range. We expected that native plant species would have negative plant&#x02013;microbe interactions in their current range, but that these would switch to positive plant&#x02013;microbe interactions outside of their range, because of a lack of coevolved pathogens in the new range.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Study species</title><p>Closely related native and nonnative species were used for this experiment to control for species responses that are attributable to phylogeny and isolate the response of plant origin (native, nonnative) to climate change and soil biota. We chose species from <italic>Eugenia,</italic> in the Myrtaceae family, because there are closely related native and nonnative species of the same genus and functional group which co-occur in subtropical hammock habitat of Florida (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). All three species are relatively abundant throughout Florida (<xref rid="CIT0081" ref-type="bibr">Wunderlin <italic>et al.</italic> 1996</xref>). These small tree and shrub species are found in subtropical habitats in Florida, central and South America and the Caribbean. <italic>Eugenia uniflora</italic>, or Surinam cherry, is native to Brazil and has been introduced to much of South America outside of Brazil, in addition to Asia, Australasia-Pacific Region, Europe and North America (<xref rid="CIT0081" ref-type="bibr">Wunderlin <italic>et al.</italic> 1996</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">ISSG 2016</xref>). <italic>E. uniflora</italic> associates with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (<xref rid="CIT0083" ref-type="bibr">Zangaro <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). <italic>E. uniflora</italic> was introduced to Florida as an ornamental and for its edible fruit prior to 1931, and has been widely planted in central and south Florida, especially for hedges (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Langeland <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). <italic>E. uniflora</italic> has a high impact on ecological communities (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">FLEPPC 2017</xref>), is able to invade upland habitat, and is located south of the freeze line in Florida. <italic>E. uniflora</italic> is considered Category I, as designated by the Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">FLEPPC 2017</xref>), which is a species that causes large ecological damage through the displacement of native species, changing community structures or ecological functions, or hybridizing with natives.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Growth chamber experiment set up</title><p>Changes in growth and germination of our three <italic>Eugenia</italic> study species was monitored in pots placed in growth chambers, using upland hammock soils from their current range in Florida and from their potential climatically induced expanded range.

The fruit covering from each seed was removed by hand and the seeds were surface sterilized in 5 % bleach solution for 15 min, and washed with de-ionized water, prior to planting.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Soil sampling</title><p>Soil was collected from three hammock habitat sites within each of the central, south and north Florida sites. Soil biota was collected in the form of fresh field-collected soil from one of two sources: the current home range [Central Florida (Cape Canaveral, FL), South Florida (Hugh Taylor Birch State Park)] or within the projected new range [North Florida (Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve, Florida)]. Soils were collected from all three Florida source regions within 1 week prior of the potting date, to ensure viability of the soil microbiota. In the south and central Florida sites, we collected soil from hammock habitats within natural areas which were at least 20 m from <italic>Eugenia</italic> shrubs or seedlings. In the north Florida site, we collected soil from randomly placed transects (using random point generator feature of ArcMap, ESRI, Redlands, CA) within hammock habitats. Within each of these three sites, two, 10-m transects were laid within hammock habitat, at least 5 m away from roads. Every 2 m, 10 cm deep soil samples were collected and placed into a Ziploc bag. The two, 10 m transects were parallel and at least 10 m apart. Soil samples were combined within each site, sieved to 2 mm, and added to the pots within 1 week of collection (as in <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Hawkes <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). We pooled soils within each site to provide a soil inoculum treatment representing all possible soil microbes in that site and the average density found within that site (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Cahill <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>), which is a common treatment used to understand the effect of soil microbes on plant germination and growth (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Grman and Suding 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Lau and Lennon 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Farrer and Suding 2016</xref>); however, this method can artificially decrease variation in plant&#x02013;microbe interactions (<xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">Reinhart and Rinella 2016</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">Rinella and Reinhart 2017</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). While variation in plant&#x02013;microbe interactions is decreased with pooling samples, this method of soil pooling is preferable when the objective is to understand if the average pathogen density found in each of two regions differentially effects plant growth (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Cahill <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>). The soil biota treatment is one of several treatments, where we evaluate plant&#x02013;microbial interactions in relation to those treatments.</p><p>The soil biota treatment was fresh field-collected soil from each of the central, south, and north Florida sites. For the control treatment, we sterilized half of these field-collected soils from the current and new ranges. The sterile soil inoculum was autoclaved three times, and we mixed the soil in between autoclave events, to ensure sterilization of the soils. The soil biota and sterile control inocula comprised 5 % of the mass of the pot, to ensure sufficient inoculation of the soil biota to the pot while also maintaining the same nutrient conditions and soil characteristics across all treatments (as in <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">Reinhart and Callaway 2006</xref>).</p><p>For each species, eight seeds were planted into a minimum of seven, sterile replicate pots (4 &#x000d7; 4 &#x000d7; 6&#x02033;) filled with sterile potting mix (MetroMix 366 sterile potting soil) and one of two soil inoculum treatments (sterile, nonsterile), two temperature treatments 2010 (e.g. &#x02018;current&#x02019;) and 2050 (e.g. &#x02018;future&#x02019; temperature conditions at our northernmost site) and three site treatments (south, central and north), for a total of 86 pots for the nonnative species and 105 pots each for the native species. Eight to nine replicate pots per treatment were made for the native species (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1a</xref>), and seven replicate pots were made per treatment for the nonnative species (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1b</xref>), as the native species have lower germination rates, relative to the nonnative <italic>Eugenia</italic> species (<xref rid="CIT0071" ref-type="bibr">Stricker and Stiling 2013</xref>). The potting dates were 27 January 2012, for the native species, and 9 May 2012, for the nonnative species, in accord with their fruiting phenology and when the seeds were collected. After germination, pots were kept in a growth chamber for the next 12 weeks, to assess growth. They were watered daily with equal amounts of water, approximately 15&#x02013;20 mL. Pots were rotated daily within the growth chamber, to control for positional effects. Care was taken to ensure that the soil biota were not cross-contaminated between pots by using sterile techniques. Germination was monitored weekly until after the appearance of the first germinant, at which point monitoring occurred daily. Daily monitoring ceased after the pots were monitored daily for 2 weeks with no new germination. Two weeks after germination ceased for each species, we selected a maximum of four seedlings to remain, and removed all other seedlings from the pot, taking care not to disturb the soil. Twelve weeks following initiation of germination, the remaining plants were harvested for total above and below-ground biomass. Shoots were cut at ground level and oven-dried separately in paper bags at 60 &#x000b0;C for 2 days. The roots were carefully washed to remove soil particles and also oven-dried at 60 &#x000b0;C in paper bags. After drying, shoots and roots were weighed with a precision balance to determine dry weight.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Statistical design and analyses</title><p>Our objective was to determine differences in closely related native and nonnative species responses to soil microbiota under conditions of range expansion and climate change. The difference in plant performance between the pots that had the living soil inoculum to those of the sterile controls was due to differences in plant response to soil biota. Additionally, the difference in native and nonnative plant performance in its home soils versus its expanded range soils was used to assess differences in plant&#x02013;soil microbe interactions between home and away sites. Last, differences in plant performance between temperature treatments can be used to assess differences in plant&#x02013;microbe interactions under climate change.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Nonnative <italic>Eugenia</italic></title><p>The experimental design for the nonnative <italic>E. uniflora</italic> was an incomplete split-plot design with climate as the main plot treatment, growth chambers nested within climate as the main plots and site and soil as subplot treatments. Total biomass was analysed with a generalized linear mixed model (<xref rid="CIT0080" ref-type="bibr">Wolfinger and O&#x02019;Connell 1993</xref>) using SAS/GLIMMIX. Climate, site and soil were fixed effects and growth chamber within climate was a random effect. The distribution was specified as lognormal and the link was specified as identity. The estimation method used was the default RSPL (residual pseudo-likelihood with expansion locus the vector of random effects solutions). With the pattern of missing combinations of climate, site and soil, it was determined that all main effects and interactions, except for the three-way interaction, could be tested for significance. Any significant effects were followed up by appropriate pairwise comparisons with suitable sequential Bonferroni corrections (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Holm 1979</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s9"><title>Native <italic>Eugenia</italic></title><p>We evaluated current and future climate treatments on the total biomass of <italic>E. axillaris</italic> and <italic>E. foetida</italic> separately, as opposed to together, as was done for the nonnative <italic>E. uniflora</italic>. Within each level of climate, we had a complete three-way factorial experiment with all combinations of species, site and soil. Here, we had no replication (multiple growth chambers) for each level of climate. Consequently, we could not directly test for climate in combination with the other factors.</p><p>A large number of total biomass values were zero due to the lack of germination of <italic>E. axillaris</italic> and <italic>E. foetida</italic>. Consequently, a finite mixture model (<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">McLachlan and Peel 2000</xref>) was chosen to analyse the data. A finite mixture model is a weighted average of two or more models. We used a two-point mixture distribution where the distribution was degenerate at zero in the case of no germination and the other was a lognormal distribution, conditional on germination. Both individual models are generalized linear models. The mixing probabilities were the probability of no germination for the degenerate distribution and the probability of germination for the lognormal distribution.</p><p>The analysis was conducted in two steps, using a hurdle model (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Cameron and Trivedi 1998</xref>). Each step included a generalized linear mixed model using SAS/GLIMMIX with species, site and soil as fixed effects. Additionally, the estimation method used was LAPLACE (approximates the marginal likelihood by using the Laplace method) since it more closely resembled the results of SAS/FMM using dual quasi-Newton optimization. First, the probability of germination was separately analysed for each level of climate. The distribution was specified as binomial and the link was specified as logit. The second step was the analysis of total biomass conditional on germination. In other words, for those seeds that did germinate, i.e. those that clear the hurdle, the total biomass can then be affected by the treatments. This is tantamount to eliminating all observations where there was no germination (zero biomass) and analysing the remaining responses. The distribution was binomial with a logit link. Any significant effects were followed up by appropriate pairwise comparisons with suitable sequential Bonferroni corrections (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Holm 1979</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s10"><title>Results</title><sec id="s11"><title>Germination of nonnative <italic>Eugenia</italic></title><p>

We expected that warming would enhance nonnative plant growth, and that the effect of warming on plant growth would be enhanced by plant&#x02013;microbe interactions because microbial activity increases with temperature. While warming significantly enhanced growth of the nonnative plant species grown in central and northern soils, the opposite was found for plants grown in southern soils. Given that the interaction between climate and soil, and site and soil were not significant, these results do not necessarily reflect plant&#x02013;soil microbe interactions. The increased biomass of the nonnative species in central and northern soils, under warmer conditions, may reflect some other aspect of the soils from the different parts of the range. Additionally, we expected that there would be fewer negative interactions from co-evolved soil pathogens outside of its current range and a net positive plant&#x02013;soil microbe interaction in the new range, which we did not find. In accord with our study, conducted in growth chambers with a difference of 1 &#x000b0;C, a greenhouse study comparing plant&#x02013;microbe interactions of native and nonnative species in the Netherlands found a temperature difference of 5 &#x000b0;C did not influence net plant&#x02013;microbe interactions of either the native or closely related nonnative species (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">van Grunsven <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>).

Given that the plant&#x02013;microbe interactions for this invasive species did not change under different temperature conditions, it is unlikely that warming significantly increased below-ground pathogens (<xref rid="CIT0075" ref-type="bibr">Van der Putten <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>), relative to soil microbiota with positive effects.</p></sec><sec id="s18"><title>Native <italic>Eugenia</italic>&#x02013;microbe interactions</title><p>We expected that native plant species would have negative plant&#x02013;microbe interactions in their current range, but positive plant&#x02013;microbe interactions outside of their current range, because of a lack of co-evolved pathogens in the new range.

Given that there is a strong positive relationship between plant&#x02013;soil feedback and the abundance of plants in the field (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Klironomos 2002</xref>), we expect that the abundance of <italic>E. axillaris</italic> would be greater than <italic>E. foetida</italic> in its current range, however, given the trend of a linear decrease of <italic>E. axillaris</italic> biomass as it was grown in soils increasingly outside of its range, from south to north (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), it may be less likely to expand its range northward than <italic>E. foetida</italic> would under warmer temperatures.</p><p>Early successional forest trees have been documented to be dominated by soil pathogens and root herbivores (<xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Packer and Clay 2000</xref>), and so our study species may be more likely to have negative plant&#x02013;soil microbe interactions than other functional groups.

It is also likely that the degree to which the plant&#x02013;soil microbe interactions manifested for our species, grown in growth chambers, was greater than what would be observed in the field (<xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">Schittko <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s19"><title>Germination and biomass of native and nonnative <italic>Eugenia</italic></title><p>Our research addressed the question of whether nonnative species will be better potential range-expanders than native species because of their propensity to have less negative plant&#x02013;soil microbe interactions, or a net positive plant&#x02013;microbe interactions, after invading a new area (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Diez <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). The germination success of the nonnative species, <italic>E. uniflora</italic>, across all temperature and soil treatments, underscores the invasive potential of this nonnative species (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Langeland <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0071" ref-type="bibr">Stricker and Stiling 2013</xref>). Invasiveness may depend on the physiology of the invaders, and their &#x02018;pre-adaptations&#x02019; (<xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">Rejmanek and Richardson 1996</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Parker and Hay 2005</xref>). In particular, <xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">Rejmanek and Richardson (1996)</xref> found that the best measures of invasiveness of <italic>Pinus</italic> species were factors of mean seed mass, minimum juvenile period and the average time between large seed-producing events, with the most invasive species having lower average seed mass, shorter juvenile periods and short times between when large crops of seeds are released. It is relatively intuitive that these characters confer a greater degree of invasiveness to a given species. If a species reaches maturity quickly, devotes less energy to each individual seed, and has short intervals between seed crops, this may quickly result in the outnumbering of other co-occurring species, especially in disturbed, open habitats. Our invasive study species had extremely high levels of germination and accrued a large amount of biomass in the 12 weeks following germination, relative to the native congeners.</p><p>The lack of significant differences in germination between native species, site or soil for either level of climate may be due to the low power associated with the growth chamber experiments for the two native species. Another possibility is there are seeds that will not germinate regardless of species, site or soil treatments, which would indicate that a hurdle model is appropriate to use (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Cameron and Trivedi 1998</xref>). For those seeds that do germinate, i.e. those that clear the hurdle, total biomass can then be affected by the treatments. Given the low germination success of the native species, especially <italic>E. axillaris</italic>, future experiments should increase the number of replicates of the native species to increase the ability to detect differences in germination.</p><p>Plant herbivory for our nonnative study species was found to be higher than that for its native, co-occurring congeners in a separate study conducted in our southern-most site (<xref rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr">Stricker and Stiling 2012</xref>), largely due to a recently introduced nonnative weevil from Sri Lanka, <italic>Myllocerus undatus</italic>. Interestingly, in a study 4 years prior on the same species and at the same site, the enemy release hypothesis was supported because significantly more specialized (oligophagous and endophagous) insect herbivory occurred on the native congeners (<italic>E. axillaris</italic> and <italic>E. foetida</italic>) than on the nonnative invasive <italic>E. uniflora</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>), at a time when the nonnative weevil was not well-established (<xref rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr">Stricker and Stiling 2012</xref>). This example may not be the norm. A meta-analysis of paired invasive and native congeners revealed significantly higher insect herbivory on the paired native congeners, suggesting that enemy release of above-ground herbivores on nonnative plant species may facilitate their invasion (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Stiling 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s20"><title>Limitations of &#x02018;black box&#x02019; approach</title><p>We used a &#x02018;black box&#x02019; approach, where we added fresh, field-collected soils to sterile soils for an inoculum of soil biota to the pots, and compared plant responses in these pots to those where the field-collected soils were sterilized before adding them to the pots. Thus, our research approach will only indicate the net effect of soil microbial communities on these plant species, and not which group of soil biota (symbionts and decomposers with positive effects or pathogens with negative effects) benefited from the experimental treatments. Additionally, by pooling the soil inoculum treatment within each site, the variation in plant&#x02013;microbe interactions was decreased, as soil mixing causes the microbial composition across the site treatment to be homogenized (<xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">Reinhart and Rinella 2016</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">Rinella and Reinhart 2017</xref>). For example, if a pathogen influencing the invasive species was present in only a small fraction of our samples, soil mixing could have caused the pathogen to be included in all of the replicates (<xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">Rinella and Reinhart 2018</xref>). Future work on these species could characterize the microbial communities found in the soils of the sites and pots, as well as fungal and bacterial colonization of roots, to evaluate which groups of soil biota occurred in and benefitted from the treatments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s21"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results from this experimental approach uniquely informs our understanding of the mechanisms that mediate range expansion of native and nonnative species under climate change. Plant&#x02013;soil microbial interactions appeared as a form of biotic resistance to our nonnative study species, <italic>E. uniflora</italic>, as evidenced by the negative plant&#x02013;microbe interactions found across its current and future range, as well as under different temperature conditions. <italic>E. uniflora</italic> had extremely high germination success and growth across all soil and temperature treatments, underscoring the invasive potential of this nonnative species. Soil microbes benefited our two native species differently across the current and future range. Outside of their current range and grown under future spring temperatures, <italic>E. foetida</italic> benefitted the most from soil microbes relative to <italic>E. axillaris</italic>, whereas the opposite was true in their current range of south Florida. This could have been due to the ability of this species to form new or greater positive generalist associations with soil biota, an escape from species-specific soil enemies, or variation between species in plant&#x02013;soil microbe interactions by geographic region (<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">McGinn <italic>et al.</italic> 2018</xref>).</p><p>The exact nature of environmental conditions associated with climatic change that nonnatives will be able to capitalize on, when compared with native species, are poorly understood (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">von Holle <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0079" ref-type="bibr">Willis <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). While the role of species interactions is likely to be important in influencing range expansion by both native and nonnative species, few studies have focused on this (<xref rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr">Svenning <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Jones and Gilbert 2016</xref>). Specifically, the role of soil microbes on species range expansion has not received as much attention as that for its role in plant community membership (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">van Grunsven <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Jones and Gilbert 2016</xref>). Our study demonstrates that soil microbiota negatively affect growth of one native and one nonnative species in habitats outside of their current range; however, one native species benefited more from soil microbes in the new range, and under warmer conditions, than the other native study species. Clearly more research is needed to elucidate the role of plant&#x02013;soil microbe interactions on native and nonnative species, when compared with other factors, to understand the potential for biotic interactions to govern range expansion in a rapidly changing world.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s22"><title>Supporting Information</title><p>The following supporting information is available in the online version of this article&#x02014;</p><p>Table S1. <italic>Eugenia uniflora</italic> germination effect tests for climate (current, future), site (north, central and south) and soil (nonsterile, sterile).</p><p>Table S2a.
