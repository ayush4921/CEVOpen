 <p>Species ranges are expected to shift in response to climate change; however, it is unclear how species interactions will affect range shifts. Our study demonstrates that, in the predicted future range, plant–soil microbial interactions appeared as a form of biotic resistance to one native and one nonnative shrub species, however soil microbes facilitated a native species in the future range, under warmer temperatures. Plant–soil microbe interactions for the native congeners depended on the geographic provenance of the soils, which may affect their ability to expand their ranges.</p>
