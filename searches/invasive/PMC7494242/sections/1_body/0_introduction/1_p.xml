<p>Understanding species responses to global change will help predict shifts in species distributions as well as aid in conservation planning and management. Climate change varies around the world and concomitant ecological responses are likely to differ by region (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2002

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2013
 </xref>). Specifically, the study of above- and below-ground biotic interactions are important to consider in relation to plant range expansion with climate change (

 <xref rid="CIT0074" ref-type="bibr">Tylianakis 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)

 </xref>). 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Gilman 
  <italic>et al</italic>. (2010)
 </xref> stressed the importance of assessing the potential effects of novel interactions precipitated by climate change, suggesting that assessing species demographic responses to interactions with species beyond current range boundaries would improve our ability to understand species range-expanding capacities.
