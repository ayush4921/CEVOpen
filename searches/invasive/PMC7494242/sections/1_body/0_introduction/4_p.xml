<p>Our research addressed the question of whether nonnative species will be better potential range-expanders than native species because of their propensity to have less negative plant–soil microbial interactions, or a net positive interactions with microbes, after invading a new area (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2010
 </xref>). We hypothesized that the ability of nonnative species to expand their range would be greater than native species, because of their ability to form positive generalist associations with soil biota and the likelihood that they will escape species-specific soil enemies (

Further, we predicted that nonnative species would have net positive associations with soil biota, and that these positive associations will increase outside their range, with plant–microbe interactions more positive in their new range than in their current range (

 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Diez 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2010
 </xref>). Additionally, we assessed whether plant–soil microbe interactions for a nonnative species are affected by climate change. We expected that warming would enhance nonnative plant growth, and that the effect of warming on plant growth would be enhanced by plant–microbe interactions because there would be fewer negative interactions from co-evolved soil pathogens outside of its current range. We expected that native plant species would have negative plant–microbe interactions in their current range, but that these would switch to positive plant–microbe interactions outside of their range, because of a lack of coevolved pathogens in the new range.
