<p>The exact nature of environmental conditions associated with climatic change that nonnatives will be able to capitalize on, when compared with native species, are poorly understood (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2007
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Jones and Gilbert 2016</xref>). Our study demonstrates that soil microbiota negatively affect growth of one native and one nonnative species in habitats outside of their current range; however, one native species benefited more from soil microbes in the new range, and under warmer conditions, than the other native study species. Clearly more research is needed to elucidate the role of plantâ€“soil microbe interactions on native and nonnative species, when compared with other factors, to understand the potential for biotic interactions to govern range expansion in a rapidly changing world.
