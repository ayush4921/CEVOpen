<p>The results from this experimental approach uniquely informs our understanding of the mechanisms that mediate range expansion of native and nonnative species under climate change. Plant–soil microbial interactions appeared as a form of biotic resistance to our nonnative study species, 
 <italic>E. uniflora</italic>, as evidenced by the negative plant–microbe interactions found across its current and future range, as well as under different temperature conditions. 
 <italic>E. uniflora</italic> had extremely high germination success and growth across all soil and temperature treatments, underscoring the invasive potential of this nonnative species. Soil microbes benefited our two native species differently across the current and future range. Outside of their current range and grown under future spring temperatures, 
 <italic>E. foetida</italic> benefitted the most from soil microbes relative to 
 <italic>E. axillaris</italic>, whereas the opposite was true in their current range of south Florida. This could have been due to the ability of this species to form new or greater positive generalist associations with soil biota, an escape from species-specific soil enemies, or variation between species in plant–soil microbe interactions by geographic region (
