<p>Total biomass of the native 
 <italic>E. axillaris</italic> grown in nonsterile soils were higher when grown in soils from the southern site soils than when grown in soils from the northern site (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), suggesting that soil microbes from the southern sites benefit 
 <italic>E. axillaris</italic> more than soil microbes from the northern sites, contrary to our hypothesis that plantâ€“microbe interactions would be positive outside of its current range, when compared with within its current range. When this species was grown in sterilized soil from the different sites, total biomass was not significantly different between the sites.
