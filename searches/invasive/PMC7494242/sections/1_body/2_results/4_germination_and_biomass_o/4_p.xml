<p>In the northernmost site, outside of their current range and under future temperature conditions, 
 <italic>E. axillaris</italic> had significantly lower biomass than 
 <italic>E. foetida</italic> when grown in nonsterile soils (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). This suggests that 
 <italic>E. foetida</italic> benefits more from the soil microbial community in the new, northern range, than 
 <italic>E. axillaris</italic>. As indicated by the significant three-way interaction between species, site and soil (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), these relationships switched in the southernmost site, where 
 <italic>E. axillaris</italic> had significantly greater biomass when grown in nonsterile soils, when compared with 
 <italic>E. foetida</italic>. This suggests that in the southernmost sites where they currently co-occur, 
 <italic>E. axillaris</italic> is benefitted by the soil microbes more than 
 <italic>E. foetida</italic>, under future climatic conditions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>).
