<p>The climate*soil term was not significant in the generalized linear mixed model, suggesting that the net negative effect of the soil biota on nonnative 
 <italic>Eugenia</italic> growth is similar for both the future and current temperature treatments. Total biomass of the invasive species 
 <italic>E. uniflora</italic> depended on the site and the climatic conditions under which it was grown, as indicated by the significant climate by site interaction (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Three separate pair-wise comparisons of current to future temperature were made for each level of site. 
 <italic>P</italic>-values of current versus future temperature at the following sites were: South (0.0144), Central (0.2226) and North (0.0248). Plants grown in soil from the northern site had significantly greater biomass when grown in warmer temperatures than in current temperatures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). This relationship switched in the southern site, where total biomass of this species was greatest under current temperatures, when compared with future, warmer temperatures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Under current temperatures, there were no statistically significant differences of 
 <italic>E. uniflora</italic> between sites [
 <italic>P</italic>-values: South versus Central (0.4026), South versus North (0.1326) and Central versus North (0.5181)]. When grown under warmer temperatures, 
 <italic>E. uniflora</italic> had significantly lower biomass in soils from the southern-most site, when compared with the central and northern sites [
 <italic>P</italic>-values: South versus Central (0.0049**), South versus North (0.0016***) and Central versus North (0.7079)].
