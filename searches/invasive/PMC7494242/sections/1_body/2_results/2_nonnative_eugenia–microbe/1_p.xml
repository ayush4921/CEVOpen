<p>The nonnative 
 <italic>E. uniflora</italic> had significantly lower biomass when grown in soils containing soil microbes, indicative of a negative plant–soil microbe interaction for this species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), and this held across all sites and temperature conditions (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Soil biota from native hammock habitats have a negative effect on the growth of nonnative 
 <italic>E. uniflora</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), regardless of site and temperature conditions. In the generalized linear mixed model, the ‘site*soil’ term was not significant, suggesting that a negative plant–soil microbe interaction is consistent across sites, including outside of its current range, contrary to our hypothesis that plant–microbe interactions would be positive outside of the current range of this species (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).
