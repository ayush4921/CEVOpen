<p>Changes in growth and germination of our three 
 <italic>Eugenia</italic> study species was monitored in pots placed in growth chambers, using upland hammock soils from their current range in Florida and from their potential climatically induced expanded range. Central Florida is the current northern limit of 
 <italic>Eugenia</italic> species in Florida (
 <xref rid="CIT0082" ref-type="bibr">Wunderlin and Hansen 2003</xref>), and so we chose a site with hammock habitats that was north and well outside of their current range, as predicted by the poleward expansion of species (
 <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Parmesan and Yohe 2003</xref>). Future temperature conditions of the northern site were estimated with a Low, B1 emission scenario; for a range of SRES emissions scenarios, and using global climate projections from the Fourth IPCC Assessment (

Pots were placed in growth chambers where diurnal variation in daylength and temperatures were simulated, with the high and low daily temperatures determined by the average daily maximum and minimum temperatures for the month of May in Jacksonville, FL (Florida Climate Center, Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies), the northernmost site from where soil was collected. The pots experienced environmental conditions simulated for current (2010) and future (2050) conditions, with 10 h of light per day and 30/17 °C and 31/18 °C and day/night temperatures ("
