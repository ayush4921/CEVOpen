<p>We evaluated current and future climate treatments on the total biomass of 
 <italic>E. axillaris</italic> and 
 <italic>E. foetida</italic> separately, as opposed to together, as was done for the nonnative 
 <italic>E. uniflora</italic>. Within each level of climate, we had a complete three-way factorial experiment with all combinations of species, site and soil. Here, we had no replication (multiple growth chambers) for each level of climate. Consequently, we could not directly test for climate in combination with the other factors.
