<p>The analysis was conducted in two steps, using a hurdle model (
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Cameron and Trivedi 1998</xref>). Each step included a generalized linear mixed model using SAS/GLIMMIX with species, site and soil as fixed effects. Additionally, the estimation method used was LAPLACE (approximates the marginal likelihood by using the Laplace method) since it more closely resembled the results of SAS/FMM using dual quasi-Newton optimization. First, the probability of germination was separately analysed for each level of climate. The distribution was specified as binomial and the link was specified as logit. The second step was the analysis of total biomass conditional on germination. In other words, for those seeds that did germinate, i.e. those that clear the hurdle, the total biomass can then be affected by the treatments. This is tantamount to eliminating all observations where there was no germination (zero biomass) and analysing the remaining responses. The distribution was binomial with a logit link. Any significant effects were followed up by appropriate pairwise comparisons with suitable sequential Bonferroni corrections (
