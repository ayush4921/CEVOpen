<p>Our objective was to determine differences in closely related native and nonnative species responses to soil microbiota under conditions of range expansion and climate change. The difference in plant performance between the pots that had the living soil inoculum to those of the sterile controls was due to differences in plant response to soil biota. Additionally, the difference in native and nonnative plant performance in its home soils versus its expanded range soils was used to assess differences in plant–soil microbe interactions between home and away sites. Last, differences in plant performance between temperature treatments can be used to assess differences in plant–microbe interactions under climate change.</p>
