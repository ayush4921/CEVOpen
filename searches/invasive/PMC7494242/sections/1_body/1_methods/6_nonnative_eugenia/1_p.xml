<p>The experimental design for the nonnative 
 <italic>E. uniflora</italic> was an incomplete split-plot design with climate as the main plot treatment, growth chambers nested within climate as the main plots and site and soil as subplot treatments. Total biomass was analysed with a generalized linear mixed model (
 <xref rid="CIT0080" ref-type="bibr">Wolfinger and Oâ€™Connell 1993</xref>) using SAS/GLIMMIX. Climate, site and soil were fixed effects and growth chamber within climate was a random effect. The distribution was specified as lognormal and the link was specified as identity. The estimation method used was the default RSPL (residual pseudo-likelihood with expansion locus the vector of random effects solutions). With the pattern of missing combinations of climate, site and soil, it was determined that all main effects and interactions, except for the three-way interaction, could be tested for significance. Any significant effects were followed up by appropriate pairwise comparisons with suitable sequential Bonferroni corrections (
