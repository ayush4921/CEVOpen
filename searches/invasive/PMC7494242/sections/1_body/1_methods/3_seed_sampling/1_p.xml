<p>Seeds were haphazardly collected from populations located within Hugh Taylor Birch State Park, in south Florida, for the one nonnative and two native study species. Seeds were collected for each species at the peak of seed production for their species. Seeds for the native species were collected on 17 December 2011, and seeds for the nonnative 
 <italic>Eugenia</italic> species were collected on 28 April 2012. The fruit covering from each seed was removed by hand and the seeds were surface sterilized in 5 % bleach solution for 15 min, and washed with de-ionized water, prior to planting.
