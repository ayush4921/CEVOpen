<p>Closely related native and nonnative species were used for this experiment to control for species responses that are attributable to phylogeny and isolate the response of plant origin (native, nonnative) to climate change and soil biota. We chose species from 
 <italic>Eugenia,</italic> in the Myrtaceae family, because there are closely related native and nonnative species of the same genus and functional group which co-occur in subtropical hammock habitat of Florida (
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Liu 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2007
 </xref>). All three species are relatively abundant throughout Florida (
 <xref rid="CIT0081" ref-type="bibr">Wunderlin 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 1996
 </xref>). These small tree and shrub species are found in subtropical habitats in Florida, central and South America and the Caribbean. 
 <italic>Eugenia uniflora</italic>, or Surinam cherry, is native to Brazil and has been introduced to much of South America outside of Brazil, in addition to Asia, Australasia-Pacific Region, Europe and North America (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 1996
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">ISSG 2016</xref>). 
 <italic>E. uniflora</italic> associates with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (
 <xref rid="CIT0083" ref-type="bibr">Zangaro 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2005
 </xref>). 
 <italic>E. uniflora</italic> was introduced to Florida as an ornamental and for its edible fruit prior to 1931, and has been widely planted in central and south Florida, especially for hedges (
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Langeland 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2008
 </xref>). 
 <italic>E. uniflora</italic> has a high impact on ecological communities (
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">FLEPPC 2017</xref>), is able to invade upland habitat, and is located south of the freeze line in Florida. 
 <italic>E. uniflora</italic> is considered Category I, as designated by the Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council (
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">FLEPPC 2017</xref>), which is a species that causes large ecological damage through the displacement of native species, changing community structures or ecological functions, or hybridizing with natives.
