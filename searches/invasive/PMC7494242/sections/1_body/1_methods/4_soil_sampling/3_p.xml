<p>For each species, eight seeds were planted into a minimum of seven, sterile replicate pots (4 × 4 × 6″) filled with sterile potting mix (MetroMix 366 sterile potting soil) and one of two soil inoculum treatments (sterile, nonsterile), two temperature treatments 2010 (e.g. ‘current’) and 2050 (e.g. ‘future’ temperature conditions at our northernmost site) and three site treatments (south, central and north), for a total of 86 pots for the nonnative species and 105 pots each for the native species. Eight to nine replicate pots per treatment were made for the native species (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1a</xref>), and seven replicate pots were made per treatment for the nonnative species (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1b</xref>), as the native species have lower germination rates, relative to the nonnative 
 <italic>Eugenia</italic> species (
 <xref rid="CIT0071" ref-type="bibr">Stricker and Stiling 2013</xref>). The potting dates were 27 January 2012, for the native species, and 9 May 2012, for the nonnative species, in accord with their fruiting phenology and when the seeds were collected. After germination, pots were kept in a growth chamber for the next 12 weeks, to assess growth. They were watered daily with equal amounts of water, approximately 15–20 mL. Pots were rotated daily within the growth chamber, to control for positional effects. Care was taken to ensure that the soil biota were not cross-contaminated between pots by using sterile techniques. Germination was monitored weekly until after the appearance of the first germinant, at which point monitoring occurred daily. Daily monitoring ceased after the pots were monitored daily for 2 weeks with no new germination. Two weeks after germination ceased for each species, we selected a maximum of four seedlings to remain, and removed all other seedlings from the pot, taking care not to disturb the soil. Twelve weeks following initiation of germination, the remaining plants were harvested for total above and below-ground biomass. Shoots were cut at ground level and oven-dried separately in paper bags at 60 °C for 2 days. The roots were carefully washed to remove soil particles and also oven-dried at 60 °C in paper bags. After drying, shoots and roots were weighed with a precision balance to determine dry weight.
