<p>Soil was collected from three hammock habitat sites within each of the central, south and north Florida sites. Soil biota was collected in the form of fresh field-collected soil from one of two sources: the current home range [Central Florida (Cape Canaveral, FL), South Florida (Hugh Taylor Birch State Park)] or within the projected new range [North Florida (Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve, Florida)]. Soils were collected from all three Florida source regions within 1 week prior of the potting date, to ensure viability of the soil microbiota. In the south and central Florida sites, we collected soil from hammock habitats within natural areas which were at least 20 m from 
 <italic>Eugenia</italic> shrubs or seedlings. In the north Florida site, we collected soil from randomly placed transects (using random point generator feature of ArcMap, ESRI, Redlands, CA) within hammock habitats. Within each of these three sites, two, 10-m transects were laid within hammock habitat, at least 5 m away from roads. Every 2 m, 10 cm deep soil samples were collected and placed into a Ziploc bag. The two, 10 m transects were parallel and at least 10 m apart. Soil samples were combined within each site, sieved to 2 mm, and added to the pots within 1 week of collection (as in

 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Farrer and Suding 2016</xref>); however, this method can artificially decrease variation in plant–microbe interactions (

 <xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). While variation in plant–microbe interactions is decreased with pooling samples, this method of soil pooling is preferable when the objective is to understand if the average pathogen density found in each of two regions differentially effects plant growth (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2017
