<p>Plant herbivory for our nonnative study species was found to be higher than that for its native, co-occurring congeners in a separate study conducted in our southern-most site (
 <xref rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr">Stricker and Stiling 2012</xref>), largely due to a recently introduced nonnative weevil from Sri Lanka, 
 <italic>Myllocerus undatus</italic>. Interestingly, in a study 4 years prior on the same species and at the same site, the enemy release hypothesis was supported because significantly more specialized (oligophagous and endophagous) insect herbivory occurred on the native congeners (
 <italic>E. axillaris</italic> and 
 <italic>E. foetida</italic>) than on the nonnative invasive 
 <italic>E. uniflora</italic> (
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Liu 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2007
 </xref>), at a time when the nonnative weevil was not well-established (
 <xref rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr">Stricker and Stiling 2012</xref>). This example may not be the norm. A meta-analysis of paired invasive and native congeners revealed significantly higher insect herbivory on the paired native congeners, suggesting that enemy release of above-ground herbivores on nonnative plant species may facilitate their invasion (
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Stiling 2006</xref>).
