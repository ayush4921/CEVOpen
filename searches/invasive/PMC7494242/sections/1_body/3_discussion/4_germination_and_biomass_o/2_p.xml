<p>The lack of significant differences in germination between native species, site or soil for either level of climate may be due to the low power associated with the growth chamber experiments for the two native species. Another possibility is there are seeds that will not germinate regardless of species, site or soil treatments, which would indicate that a hurdle model is appropriate to use (
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Cameron and Trivedi 1998</xref>). For those seeds that do germinate, i.e. those that clear the hurdle, total biomass can then be affected by the treatments. Given the low germination success of the native species, especially 
 <italic>E. axillaris</italic>, future experiments should increase the number of replicates of the native species to increase the ability to detect differences in germination.
