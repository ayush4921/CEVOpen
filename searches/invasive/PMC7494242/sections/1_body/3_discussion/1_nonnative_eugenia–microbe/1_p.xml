<p>Soil biota from native hammock habitats have a negative effect on the growth of nonnative 
 <italic>E. uniflora,</italic> irrespective of site and temperature conditions. Our finding of a negative plant–soil microbe interaction across all sites, including outside of its current range, is contrary to our hypothesis that plant–microbe interactions would be positive for this nonnative species, especially outside of the current range of this species. Pathogens tend to cluster phylogenetically (
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Agrawal and Kotanen 2003</xref>), and could ‘hop’ from native to nonnative hosts with relative ease (
 <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Parker and Gilbert 2004</xref>), which may be especially true of our nonnative study species, which co-occurs with native congeners in the hammock habitat of our southern and central sites (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2007
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0071" ref-type="bibr">Stricker and Stiling 2013</xref>), including our two native study species. Research focusing on PSF of nonnative species which invade habitats with resident congeners and have a higher shared evolutionary history differ substantially from studies which simply compare PSF between native and nonnative species, regardless of their evolutionary history (

 </xref>). For example, in Europe, the fungal communities associated with the introduced lodgepole pine (
 <italic>Pinus contorta</italic>) comprised those species associated with the local native Scots pine, 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic>; however, in South America where the most closely related native species is in the 
 <italic>Nothofagus</italic> genus, the fungal communities of this introduced species comprised those found from its native range (
