<p>For invasive plants, enemy release has been estimated to attenuate over the course of approximately 200 years (

 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Lankau 2011</xref>), likely due to an increasing chance of soil pathogens arriving from their home range (

 <italic>E. uniflora</italic> experienced enemy release upon introduction to Florida in 1931, it seems unlikely that enemy release for this species would attenuate more than twice as rapidly as enemy release in other studies.
