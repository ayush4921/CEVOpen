<p>We used a ‘black box’ approach, where we added fresh, field-collected soils to sterile soils for an inoculum of soil biota to the pots, and compared plant responses in these pots to those where the field-collected soils were sterilized before adding them to the pots. Thus, our research approach will only indicate the net effect of soil microbial communities on these plant species, and not which group of soil biota (symbionts and decomposers with positive effects or pathogens with negative effects) benefited from the experimental treatments. Additionally, by pooling the soil inoculum treatment within each site, the variation in plant–microbe interactions was decreased, as soil mixing causes the microbial composition across the site treatment to be homogenized (

Future work on these species could characterize the microbial communities found in the soils of the sites and pots, as well as fungal and bacterial colonization of roots, to evaluate which groups of soil biota occurred in and benefitted from the treatments.
