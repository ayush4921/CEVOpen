<p>We expected that native plant species would have negative plant–microbe interactions in their current range, but positive plant–microbe interactions outside of their current range, because of a lack of co-evolved pathogens in the new range. We found evidence that the native 
 <italic>E. axillaris</italic> benefited from soils from their current range relative to 
 <italic>E. foetida</italic>, however this relationship switched in the new range, under future climatic conditions. Given that there is a strong positive relationship between plant–soil feedback and the abundance of plants in the field (
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Klironomos 2002</xref>), we expect that the abundance of 
 <italic>E. axillaris</italic> would be greater than 
 <italic>E. foetida</italic> in its current range, however, given the trend of a linear decrease of 
 <italic>E. axillaris</italic> biomass as it was grown in soils increasingly outside of its range, from south to north (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), it may be less likely to expand its range northward than 
 <italic>E. foetida</italic> would under warmer temperatures.
