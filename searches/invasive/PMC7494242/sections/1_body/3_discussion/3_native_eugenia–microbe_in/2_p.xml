<p>Early successional forest trees have been documented to be dominated by soil pathogens and root herbivores (
 <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Packer and Clay 2000</xref>), and so our study species may be more likely to have negative plant–soil microbe interactions than other functional groups. Further, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal tree systems tend to have negative plant–soil microbe interactions, in general (
