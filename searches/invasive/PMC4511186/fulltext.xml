Delimiting this range of conditions is a methodological challenge, because it is impossible to sample all potential field locations for any species in a given region. Developing approaches to track ecological range over time could substantially contribute to understanding invasion dynamics. In this study, we use a previously established sampling strategy to document apparent changes across a 15-year time interval in the ecological range of the Asian annual <italic>Polygonum cespitosum</italic> Blume in northeastern North America, where the species has recently become invasive. Using a structured sample drawn from a large set of field populations, we determined the range of light, soil moisture and soil nutrient conditions that the species currently occupies in this region and the proportional distribution of individuals in differing types of microsite, and compared them with field measurements that were similarly determined 15 years earlier. Although in 1994 the species was absent from both high-light and flooded habitats, in 2009 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> occurred in open as well as shaded habitats, across a wide range of moisture conditions. In 2009 the species also occupied a greater proportion of high-light microsites within field sites than in 1994. These findings suggest an expanded ecological range that, intriguingly, is consistent with the recent evolution in North American <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> populations of adaptive plasticity in response to high light. Possible non-evolutionary explanations for the change in field distribution are also considered.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Ecological distribution</kwd><kwd>invasive spread</kwd><kwd>light availability</kwd><kwd>phenotypic plasticity</kwd><kwd>soil moisture</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>A non-indigenous species' transition from introduced to invasive is usually marked by the onset of aggressive range expansion (<xref rid="PLV038C29" ref-type="bibr">Theoharides and Dukes 2007</xref>; <xref rid="PLV038C30" ref-type="bibr">Val&#x000e9;ry <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>). Typically, studies of range expansion in introduced species model the geographic spread of these species at regional scales using historical presence/absence data, often in combination with climatic data (e.g. <xref rid="PLV038C6" ref-type="bibr">Elton 1958</xref>; <xref rid="PLV038C19" ref-type="bibr">Paterson 2000</xref>; <xref rid="PLV038C25" ref-type="bibr">Salo 2005</xref>; <xref rid="PLV038C23" ref-type="bibr">Preisser <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="PLV038C16" ref-type="bibr">Lyons and Scheibling 2009</xref>). However, within an introduced species' geographic range, ecological factors such as resource availability and community composition will determine which particular habitats the species is able to invade (<xref rid="PLV038C20" ref-type="bibr">Pearson and Dawson 2003</xref>). Despite the abundance of research documenting geographic range expansion in introduced species, little is known about how an introduced species may expand its ecological range, i.e. the set of local environmental conditions in which such a species can successfully establish populations (see <xref rid="PLV038C1" ref-type="bibr">Alexander and Edwards 2010</xref>; for a general discussion of species distribution in relation to ecological niche, see <xref rid="PLV038C7" ref-type="bibr">Guisan and Thuiller 2005</xref>; <xref rid="PLV038C8" ref-type="bibr">Hargreaves <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>).</p><p>Ecological range expansion may be a particularly important aspect of the invasion process to document because it can influence future invasion dynamics in two key ways. First, expansion into a broader range of ecological conditions may enhance a species' rate of spread by increasing connectivity among suitable habitats and the probability of dispersal to suitable sites (<xref rid="PLV038C31" ref-type="bibr">With 2002</xref>; <xref rid="PLV038C9" ref-type="bibr">Hastings <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>; <xref rid="PLV038C29" ref-type="bibr">Theoharides and Dukes 2007</xref>). Second, if newly colonized habitats have greater resource availability than ancestral habitats (which is typical of the disturbed, open conditions colonized by many invasive species, <xref rid="PLV038C29" ref-type="bibr">Theoharides and Dukes 2007</xref>), ecological range expansion may increase individual fitness, population growth rate and propagule pressure on adjacent habitats (<xref rid="PLV038C9" ref-type="bibr">Hastings <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>; <xref rid="PLV038C15" ref-type="bibr">Lockwood <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>).</p><p>A number of ecological and evolutionary processes can lead to changes in a species' ecological range (see <xref rid="PLV038C10" ref-type="bibr">Holt 2003</xref>). Expansion can occur after a species is introduced to a new region if its populations in that region evolve broader individual repertoires of adaptive plasticity to contrasting conditions (e.g. <xref rid="PLV038C13" ref-type="bibr">Lavergne and Molofsky 2007</xref>; reviewed in <xref rid="PLV038C24" ref-type="bibr">Richards <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>; <xref rid="PLV038C17" ref-type="bibr">Matesanz <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>). Indeed, selection in the disturbed, heterogeneous environments typically colonized by introduced species may favour the evolution of such increased plasticity, which may in turn allow an introduced species to spread into a wider range of habitats (<xref rid="PLV038C14" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Gelembiuk 2008</xref>; <xref rid="PLV038C28" ref-type="bibr">Sultan <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>). Alternatively, ecological range expansion may occur if geographically separate populations become locally adapted to diverse habitats, if genotypes from distinct habitats in a species&#x02019; home range are brought in over time via multiple introductions (<xref rid="PLV038C5" ref-type="bibr">Dlugosch and Parker 2008</xref>), or due to non-evolutionary processes, such as changes in community composition that facilitate a introduced species' occupancy of previously unsuitable habitats (<xref rid="PLV038C8" ref-type="bibr">Hargreaves <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>). For instance, populations of the Atlantic coast shore-grass <italic>Spartina alterniflora</italic> stabilize cobble beaches, which are then occupied by a diverse community of other plants (and their associated animals) that would otherwise be excluded (<xref rid="PLV038C3" ref-type="bibr">Bruno and Kennedy 2000</xref>).</p><p>Despite its importance for understanding biological invasion, determining the extent of a species' ecological range over time is problematic, since even a dataset based on many field populations may by chance lack infrequent types of sites that would enlarge the range. Indeed, the only <italic>absolutely</italic> definitive way to characterize a species' ecological range at a given time point is to sample every possible location within its geographic distribution and to measure all possible environmental parameters within each of them. A feasible alternative is to construct a set of natural populations, based on a broad sampling of field habitats, that collectively encompass the <italic>full range of environmental conditions</italic> (i.e. the highest and lowest resource levels) in which the species occurs and forms viable populations (<xref rid="PLV038C4" ref-type="bibr">Colwell and Futuyma 1971</xref>; see <xref rid="PLV038C27" ref-type="bibr">Sultan <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>). This type of population sample, specifically designed to include the environmental extremes in which the species is found, will be more informative for delimiting ecological range than a random population sample (<xref rid="PLV038C27" ref-type="bibr">Sultan <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>). Moreover, using a smaller number of field sites makes it possible to comprehensively measure environmental variability within each site and to assess the distribution of individuals among different microsites. Such microsite data are critical because they make it possible to distinguish environmental shifts in a species' realized distribution from changes that could possibly result simply from increased dispersal. A final element in this strategy is to focus on certain key environmental variables; such as light, soil moisture and nutrient availability. Using this approach at two or more time points, it is possible to statistically test for changes in ecological range for the specified variables. Despite the inevitable interpretive limitations of a finite field sample, such environmental comparisons can provide useful insights to this critical dimension of invasive spread.</p><p>Here we document a measurable change over a recent 15-year period in the ecological range of the Asian annual <italic>Polygonum</italic> (s.l.) <italic>cespitosum</italic> Blume (<italic>Persicaria cespitosa</italic>, <xref rid="PLV038C11" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>) in northeastern North America, where the species was introduced in the early 1900s (<xref rid="PLV038C19" ref-type="bibr">Paterson 2000</xref>). Its tiny achenes are readily dispersed (e.g. in mud and plant debris) and the species has spread rapidly across the continent (it has been reported throughout eastern North America), aided by transport on animal hooves, shoes and vehicle tyres. <italic>Polygonum cespitosum</italic> is of particular interest because it was rather recently introduced in New England (first listed in 1976; <xref rid="PLV038C18" ref-type="bibr">Mehrhoff <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>) and subsequently has become invasive in this part of its non-native range. Throughout most of its residency in the region, the species has inhabited moderately shaded, moist sites (<xref rid="PLV038C27" ref-type="bibr">Sultan <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>) similar to those typical of its native Asian range (<xref rid="PLV038C2" ref-type="bibr">Anjen <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>). However, within just the past two decades, <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> populations have been reported in open sites in New England, often forming very dense monocultures (<xref rid="PLV038C18" ref-type="bibr">Mehrhoff <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>). A series of glasshouse studies showed that, during this same time interval, local populations in the species' introduced range have rapidly evolved increased adaptive plasticity in response to high-light conditions (<xref rid="PLV038C28" ref-type="bibr">Sultan <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>). This intriguing scenario suggests that the species might be undergoing an expansion of its ecological range to include open habitats, and that this change in ecological breadth could be contributing to its recent transition to invasiveness.</p><p>In this study, we measured the range of light, soil moisture and soil nutrient levels in which <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> currently occurs in northeastern North America (2009 field data), and compared these measurements with the species&#x02019; ranges of light, moisture and nutrient conditions that were similarly determined 15 years earlier (1994 field data; <xref rid="PLV038C27" ref-type="bibr">Sultan <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>). Specifically, we asked the following questions: over the last 15 years, has <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> measurably expanded its ecological range in northeastern North America? If so, does the species occur in habitats from which it was absent in the past (e.g. sunny habitats), and has it shifted its occupancy of different types of microsite within sites? We discuss the potential implications of ecological range expansion on the species&#x02019; potential invasive spread, in terms of individual and population performance. Because detailed historical data on the environments inhabited by introduced species are rare, to our knowledge this is the first study that uses comparisons of environmental data across time to assess change in ecological range during an ongoing species invasion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Population/site sample</title><p>In order to rigorously compare the recent (2009) ecological range of the species with its earlier (1994) ecological range, we precisely quantified the highest and lowest levels of insolation, soil moisture and macronutrient conditions in which viable populations of the species were found (see <xref rid="PLV038C4" ref-type="bibr">Colwell and Futuyma 1971</xref>). In 1994 and 2009, more than 50 field sites were examined in a common geographic area extending from southwestern Connecticut to northern and central Massachusetts (an area of &#x0223c;40 000 km<sup>2</sup>). This initial examination covered the complete range of habitat types in which annual plants occur in Northeastern North America, including a broad variety of naturally and artificially disturbed habitats such as forest paths and trails, road embankments and meadows. For each year, based on environmental measurements taken at 14&#x02013;18 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> sites chosen from this initial large sample (details below), five disjunct natural populations of the species, consisting of at least 100 individuals, were chosen to encompass the full range of conditions occupied. Hence, the final population sample in each year reflected the highest and lowest resource levels revealed in an initially large, random sample of field populations. Importantly, environmental conditions (daily precipitation for the months previous to data collection as well as annual precipitation) of the study years when the environmental measurements were performed were very similar (differences in spring&#x02013;summer and annual precipitation between 1994 and 2009 were &#x0003c;4 %) <bold>[see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/plv038/-/DC1">Supporting Information</ext-link>]</bold> which allowed a meaningful comparison between years that was not affected by between-year climatic variation.</p><p>In 1994, light availability (% of full photosynthetically active radiation, PAR) and soil moisture (at 0&#x02013;10 cm depth) were measured early in the growth season at 18 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> population sites across the region (see details below and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/plv038/-/DC1"><bold>Supporting Information</bold></ext-link>), and plant community composition. From this initial set of 18 populations, the five populations in sites most different from one another were selected for detailed investigation as representing the range of environmental conditions across which the species occurred. This subset included the sites with highest and lowest light availability (TP1 and ARL), highest and lowest soil moisture (TP1 and RW) and the sites with intermediate light and moisture conditions but contrasting mixtures of herbaceous and woody plant species (ORD and WEI; see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV038F1">1</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/plv038/-/DC1"><bold>Supporting Information</bold></ext-link> for population locations and settings); details of measurements and population/site sample selection are available in <xref rid="PLV038C27" ref-type="bibr">Sultan <italic>et al</italic>.

Importantly, these data were collected as part of a multi-species comparison, which included many sites in types of habitats from which <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> was absent, and therefore, any measured increase in ecological range between years was not likely due to incomplete sampling in 1994.

In order to further ensure comparability of the environmental measurements in both years, the same field protocols were followed (see below). For both years, field measurements were made both (i) during seedling establishment and juvenile growth (23 June&#x02013;6 July 1994 and 28 June&#x02013;15 July 2009; early sampling date) and (ii) during peak of achene (seed) production by mature plants (25 August&#x02013;3 September 1994 and 31 August&#x02013;15 September 2009; late sampling date). In both 1994 and 2009 the early sampling date was well after tree leaf expansion, and the late sampling date was before the onset of autumn leaf fall, so measurements were taken at comparable points in the growth season across years.</p><sec id="s2b1"><title>Soil moisture</title><p>Soil moisture (percentage of field capacity) was determined gravimetrically at both early and late sampling dates for each population site, from samples taken at 0&#x02013;10 cm depth and 20&#x02013;30 cm depth.

To ensure comparable sampling conditions, all samples were collected at least 3 days after the most recent rainfall. Soil moisture content was calculated as the percentage of soil mass lost after oven-drying at 70 &#x000b0;C to constant weight. Soil moisture content was then converted to a percentage of field capacity (a proxy for soil water potential) which was determined separately for each site soil and sample depth by weighing, drying at 65 &#x000b0;C for 48 h, and reweighing soil that had been fully saturated with water and allowed to drain overnight (<xref rid="PLV038C12" ref-type="bibr">Klute 1986</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b2"><title>Light availability</title><p>Instantaneous light availability was measured on sunny days between 1030 and 1600 hours using an Accupar LP-80 sunfleck ceptometer (Decagon Devices, WA, USA).

At each population site, on each sampling date, a total of 15&#x02013;16 transects covering the spatial extent of the population were established at both <italic>Polygonum</italic> canopy height (&#x0223c;20&#x02013;30 cm aboveground level) and one-half of canopy height (10&#x02013;15 cm), for a total of 240&#x02013;256 data points per population site per date (8 data points per sample &#x000d7; 15&#x02013;16 samples per population &#x000d7; 2 heights). Measurements were converted to a percentage of total available PAR in full sun (PAR intensity at a separate quantum sensor placed in the nearest fully insolated location and wired to the ceptometer). To characterize the distribution of high- and low-light microsites, the proportion of measurements with &#x0003e;80 % available PAR and &#x0003c;10 % available PAR was calculated for each sample of eight measurements from each transect for each site and date.</p><p>In 2009, the species&#x02019; range of light conditions was also quantified using hemispherical photography, a method of directly quantifying canopy closure to infer light availability based on the sun's trajectory.

A hand-held level and magnetic compass were used to orient the camera. Photographs were analysed with HemiView version 2.1 (Delta-T Devices, Ltd, Cambridge, UK), with light/dark thresholds selected based on the photograph's lighting and individually checked for each image to ensure consistent analysis. Global site factor (GSF), an indicator of photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) received during a day compared with PPFD at a completely unobstructed site, was calculated as (0.9 &#x000d7; direct site factor + 0.1 &#x000d7; indirect site factor) (<xref rid="PLV038C32" ref-type="bibr">Valladares <italic>et al</italic>. 1997</xref>). Mean and median sunfleck durations (interval of direct insolation) were calculated for each photograph.

Reproductive output per square metre was estimated as individual reproductive output &#x000d7; population density (based on the late sampling date measurements).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Mixed ANOVA with type-III sums of squares was used to test for differences between sampling years in soil moisture (% of field capacity), light availability (% available PAR) and the proportion of low- and high-light microsites. The model tested for the effects of year (2009 vs. 1994), population site (nested within year) and sampling date (early vs. late) for all variables, and also for the effect of height (canopy vs. mid-canopy) for light measurements, depth (0&#x02013;10 cm vs. 20&#x02013;30 cm) for soil moisture measurements and ceptometer transect (nested within year, population, sampling date and height) for percentage available PAR. Measurement height (or depth) and sampling date were included as terms in the analysis because they were of interest as distinct samples of different aspects of the population's environment, though separate analyses conducted with data from the different depths or sampling dates as unique datasets rendered similar results. Transect was treated as a random factor. All other factors were treated as fixed. Initially, all interactions were tested, but because the interactions were not of primary interest, interactions for which <italic>P</italic>&#x0003e; 0.2 in the initial analysis were dropped from subsequent analyses. Because depth was NS for soil moisture, the two depths were pooled in correlation analyses (see below). Because soil samples for nutrient analysis were pooled from each site, depth and sampling date, we did not statistically test for differences among populations in soil properties. Mean nutrient content values were calculated for each population in each year, and these population-mean values for 1994 and 2009 were categorized according to current guidelines for soils in this region (University of Connecticut Soil Testing Lab, <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://soiltest.uconn.edu/factsheet.php">http://soiltest.uconn.edu/factsheet.php</uri>, University of Massachusetts Soil and Plant Tissue Testing Lab, <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://soiltest.umass.edu/fact-sheets/soil-test-interpretation-recommendations">http://soiltest.umass.edu/fact-sheets/soil-test-interpretation-recommendations</uri>).</p><p>To test for ecological range expansion, linear contrasts were used comparing the most extreme site in 1994 to the most extreme site in 2009 for each factor (e.g. the contrast tested for a significant difference between the driest site in 1994 and the driest site in 2009, etc.). In cases where the contrast showed a significant change in the most extreme site for a given environmental factor, the second most extreme site from the year with the broader range was compared with the most extreme site from the year with the narrower range to verify that the measured change in ecological range was not due to sampling an extremely unusual site by chance. Linear correlation analyses were used to assess the correlations of individual and population performance (leaf number, reproductive output, density, cover, proportion of individuals flowering, reproductive output per square meter) with environmental variables (soil moisture and GSF) in 2009. All analyses were performed in JMP v 7 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Soil moisture</title><p>In 2009, <italic>P. cespitosum</italic>'s ecological range included sites with higher average soil moisture than those it inhabited in 1994, as well as wetter microsites (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="PLV038TB1" ref-type="table">1</xref>; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV038F2">2</xref>).

In 1994, the species was excluded from high-light as well as flooded habitats and habitat patches (microsites within sites) in this region (<xref rid="PLV038C27" ref-type="bibr">Sultan <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>). As of 2009, the distribution of <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> in the same region included sites with increased mean light availability, a higher proportion of high-light microsites, sites with higher average soil moisture and wetter microsites than were occupied by the species in 1994.</p><p>The newly colonized high-light habitats span the range of moisture environments inhabited by <italic>P. cespitosum.</italic> Although the driest sites in both years had similar soil moisture, the driest site in 2009 had higher light availability than the driest site in 1994. Because of the increased transpirational demands of high-light habitats, the combination of high light and dry soil represents a novel stress level for the species compared with its 1994 distribution. The change in <italic>P. cespitosum</italic>'s distribution documented in this study signifies a true expansion since the species now colonizes the full breadth of 1994 habitats as well as the new, sunnier and wetter habitats. Although this initial dataset is not definitive, these findings suggest that ecological range expansion is accompanying the species' increasingly invasive spread in the region (<xref rid="PLV038C18" ref-type="bibr">Mehrhoff <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>).</p><p>Comparative data on field distribution cannot be absolutely conclusive, since one cannot exhaustively sample every possible site across a large range. However, the difference described above is unlikely to be an artefact for several reasons. First, the 1994 data on <italic>P. cespitosum</italic>'s ecological range were collected as part of a multi-species comparison that included annual congeners that did occupy high-light and flooded habitats and habitat patches. Although many such sites in the region were examined in 1994, <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> was not found in <italic>any</italic> open, moist site or habitat patch within a site, which strongly supports the conclusion that <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> did not occur in these conditions in northeastern North America at that time (<xref rid="PLV038C27" ref-type="bibr">Sultan <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>). Second, our sampling strategy allowed us to assess the distribution of <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> plants with respect to environmentally distinct microsites within each of the field populations, a key indicator of change in the species' realized ecological niche. Compared with the 1994 dataset, in 2009 a significantly lower proportion of plants occurred in low-light microsites, and a (more than three-fold) higher proportion were found in high-light microsites. Although it could perhaps be argued that the species' new occupancy of open, wet sites might reflect newly successful dispersal into those sites rather than a change in ecological tolerance <italic>per se</italic>, a changed pattern of microsite occupancy <italic>within</italic> field sites could not result from greater dispersal (see <xref rid="PLV038C8" ref-type="bibr">Hargreaves <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref> on the difficulty in many distribution studies of distinguishing dispersal from environmental factors).</p><p>Finally, annual precipitation in this area was virtually identical in 1994 and 2009, so the difference in soil moisture documented in the 2009 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> sites and microsites does not reflect between-year climatic variation. As with any multi-year field study, however, the possibility remains that some unknown environmental difference between measurement years contributed to the change here documented in the extent of resource levels occupied by the species. For instance, if a competitor, pathogen or herbivore, was present in high-light and wet sites in 1994 but absent for some reason in 2009, the species might be newly able to occupy those sites. It seems unlikely however that any such ecological interaction would be consistently present versus absent in all of the numerous sites sampled each year. A species' ecological distribution can also shift or expand due to changes within habitats in the species' geographical range, for instance in community composition, soil biota or disturbance regime. The change between 1994 and 2009 in <italic>P. cespitosum</italic>'s ecological distribution within northeastern North America does not appear to be related to such changes within that range, since we found no changes in the presence or abundance of interacting plant or animal species. Instead, the species is now colonizing open habitat types that were already present in this part of its introduced range (and indeed already inhabited by congeners such as <italic>P. persicaria</italic>; <xref rid="PLV038C27" ref-type="bibr">Sultan <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>). This suggests that ecological range expansion may have resulted from a change in the species' performance in high-light environments, rather than from environmental changes at <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> populations. However, it is possible that changes in microbial community that we did not measure could have also contributed to the changed ecological range of the species.</p><p>Along with these possible habitat factors influencing ecological distribution, broad environmental tolerance that results in an invasive species colonizing a variety of habitats may result from high individual plasticity (<xref rid="PLV038C26" ref-type="bibr">Sultan 2004</xref>). Indeed, many successful invasive species show greater plasticity for functional traits in the introduced compared with the native range (<xref rid="PLV038C24" ref-type="bibr">Richards <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>). An intriguing possibility is that ecological range expansion in <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> between 1994 and 2009 may have been facilitated by changed patterns of adaptive plasticity. Such plasticity changes were found to have occurred between 1994 and 2005 in three replicate North American populations of the species (<xref rid="PLV038C28" ref-type="bibr">Sultan <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>). Compared with earlier-collected (1994) individuals, recently evolved (2005) <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> plants showed greater functional adaptation and significantly higher fitness in a glasshouse treatment simulating the high-light, high-moisture environments <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> has recently begun to colonize, but no reduction in performance in controlled shade conditions (<xref rid="PLV038C28" ref-type="bibr">Sultan <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>). Although a retrospective field study such as this cannot definitively test any causal explanation, it is certainly suggestive that these rapidly evolved changes in individual plasticity patterns are broadly consistent with the expansion in <italic>P. cespitosum</italic>'s ecological distribution. The coincidence of rapid evolution of adaptations to high-light environments, and the species' spread into high-light habitats in northeastern North America during the same very recent time period, suggests that the evolution of increased plasticity in introduced-range populations of <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> may have contributed to the ecological range expansion of the species in this region.</p><p>Whatever the precise causes, the species' expanded ecological range is likely to affect the future dynamics of its invasive spread. Clearly its geographic spread will be increased if a greater proportion of the introduced range offers suitable habitat. Additionally, expansion into new sites will result in increased connectivity among suitable habitats, which is likely to enhance dispersal to suitable sites and the rate of spatial spread (<xref rid="PLV038C31" ref-type="bibr">With 2002</xref>; <xref rid="PLV038C9" ref-type="bibr">Hastings <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>; <xref rid="PLV038C29" ref-type="bibr">Theoharides and Dukes 2007</xref>). This may be particularly important for <italic>P. cespitosum</italic>'s spread in northeastern North America, where the species' historic low-light forest habitats are interspersed with the open meadows, agricultural fields and developed areas it is now able to colonize. Increased habitat connectivity will also enhance gene flow among populations, which may affect processes like local adaptation and geographic expansion at the leading edge of the invasion (<xref rid="PLV038C29" ref-type="bibr">Theoharides and Dukes 2007</xref>). <italic>Polygonum cespitosum</italic> populations in the newly colonized high-light sites showed higher reproductive output at both individual and population levels compared with populations in sites with lower levels of available light. This enhanced performance may lead to further expansion into new sites and possibly new habitats as well, as a result of increased propagule pressure on adjacent locations (<xref rid="PLV038C31" ref-type="bibr">With 2002</xref>; <xref rid="PLV038C9" ref-type="bibr">Hastings <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>; <xref rid="PLV038C15" ref-type="bibr">Lockwood <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>).</p><p>Niche-based models of species' distributions in future environments (including habitat-distribution and climate-envelope models) usually assume constant habitat requirements through time (e.g. <xref rid="PLV038C21" ref-type="bibr">Peterson and Vieglais 2001</xref>). Our results provide initial empirical support for the possibility that a species&#x02019; ecological range may actually expand, perhaps rapidly (see also <xref rid="PLV038C20" ref-type="bibr">Pearson and Dawson 2003</xref>; <xref rid="PLV038C1" ref-type="bibr">Alexander and Edwards 2010</xref>). A research focus on ecological range can add a critically important dimension to the study of biological invasion as well as species' distributions more broadly (see meta-analysis in <xref rid="PLV038C8" ref-type="bibr">Hargreaves <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>). We hope that this initial study will encourage invasion biologists to develop robust, consensus approaches to the challenging but central issue of ecological range expansion.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Sources of Funding</title><p>This work was funded by a <funding-source>Marie Curie IOF Postdoctoral Fellowship (European Commission FP7)</funding-source> and a <funding-source>US National Science Foundation Research Grant</funding-source> (<award-id>DEB-9496050</award-id>).
