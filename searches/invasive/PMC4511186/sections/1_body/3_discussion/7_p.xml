<p>Niche-based models of species' distributions in future environments (including habitat-distribution and climate-envelope models) usually assume constant habitat requirements through time (e.g. 
 <xref rid="PLV038C21" ref-type="bibr">Peterson and Vieglais 2001</xref>). Our results provide initial empirical support for the possibility that a speciesâ€™ ecological range may actually expand, perhaps rapidly (see also

 <xref rid="PLV038C1" ref-type="bibr">Alexander and Edwards 2010</xref>). A research focus on ecological range can add a critically important dimension to the study of biological invasion as well as species' distributions more broadly (see meta-analysis in 
 <xref rid="PLV038C8" ref-type="bibr">Hargreaves 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2014
 </xref>). We hope that this initial study will encourage invasion biologists to develop robust, consensus approaches to the challenging but central issue of ecological range expansion.
