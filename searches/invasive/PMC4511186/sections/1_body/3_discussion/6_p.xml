<p>Whatever the precise causes, the species' expanded ecological range is likely to affect the future dynamics of its invasive spread. Clearly its geographic spread will be increased if a greater proportion of the introduced range offers suitable habitat. Additionally, expansion into new sites will result in increased connectivity among suitable habitats, which is likely to enhance dispersal to suitable sites and the rate of spatial spread (

 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic>'s spread in northeastern North America, where the species' historic low-light forest habitats are interspersed with the open meadows, agricultural fields and developed areas it is now able to colonize. Increased habitat connectivity will also enhance gene flow among populations, which may affect processes like local adaptation and geographic expansion at the leading edge of the invasion (

 <italic>Polygonum cespitosum</italic> populations in the newly colonized high-light sites showed higher reproductive output at both individual and population levels compared with populations in sites with lower levels of available light. This enhanced performance may lead to further expansion into new sites and possibly new habitats as well, as a result of increased propagule pressure on adjacent locations (
