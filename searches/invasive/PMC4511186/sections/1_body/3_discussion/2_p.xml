<p>The newly colonized high-light habitats span the range of moisture environments inhabited by 
 <italic>P. cespitosum.</italic> Although the driest sites in both years had similar soil moisture, the driest site in 2009 had higher light availability than the driest site in 1994. Because of the increased transpirational demands of high-light habitats, the combination of high light and dry soil represents a novel stress level for the species compared with its 1994 distribution. The change in 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic>'s distribution documented in this study signifies a true expansion since the species now colonizes the full breadth of 1994 habitats as well as the new, sunnier and wetter habitats. Although this initial dataset is not definitive, these findings suggest that ecological range expansion is accompanying the species' increasingly invasive spread in the region (
