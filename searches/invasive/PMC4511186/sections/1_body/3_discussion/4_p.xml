<p>Finally, annual precipitation in this area was virtually identical in 1994 and 2009, so the difference in soil moisture documented in the 2009 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> sites and microsites does not reflect between-year climatic variation. As with any multi-year field study, however, the possibility remains that some unknown environmental difference between measurement years contributed to the change here documented in the extent of resource levels occupied by the species. For instance, if a competitor, pathogen or herbivore, was present in high-light and wet sites in 1994 but absent for some reason in 2009, the species might be newly able to occupy those sites. It seems unlikely however that any such ecological interaction would be consistently present versus absent in all of the numerous sites sampled each year. A species' ecological distribution can also shift or expand due to changes within habitats in the species' geographical range, for instance in community composition, soil biota or disturbance regime. The change between 1994 and 2009 in 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic>'s ecological distribution within northeastern North America does not appear to be related to such changes within that range, since we found no changes in the presence or abundance of interacting plant or animal species. Instead, the species is now colonizing open habitat types that were already present in this part of its introduced range (and indeed already inhabited by congeners such as 
 <italic>P. persicaria</italic>; 
 <xref rid="PLV038C27" ref-type="bibr">Sultan 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 1998
 </xref>). This suggests that ecological range expansion may have resulted from a change in the species' performance in high-light environments, rather than from environmental changes at 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> populations. However, it is possible that changes in microbial community that we did not measure could have also contributed to the changed ecological range of the species.
