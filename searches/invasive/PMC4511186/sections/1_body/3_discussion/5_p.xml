<p>Along with these possible habitat factors influencing ecological distribution, broad environmental tolerance that results in an invasive species colonizing a variety of habitats may result from high individual plasticity (
 <xref rid="PLV038C26" ref-type="bibr">Sultan 2004</xref>). Indeed, many successful invasive species show greater plasticity for functional traits in the introduced compared with the native range (

  <italic>et al</italic>. 2006
 </xref>). An intriguing possibility is that ecological range expansion in 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> between 1994 and 2009 may have been facilitated by changed patterns of adaptive plasticity. Such plasticity changes were found to have occurred between 1994 and 2005 in three replicate North American populations of the species (

  <italic>et al</italic>. 2013
 </xref>). Compared with earlier-collected (1994) individuals, recently evolved (2005) 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> plants showed greater functional adaptation and significantly higher fitness in a glasshouse treatment simulating the high-light, high-moisture environments 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> has recently begun to colonize, but no reduction in performance in controlled shade conditions (
 <xref rid="PLV038C28" ref-type="bibr">Sultan 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2013
 </xref>). Although a retrospective field study such as this cannot definitively test any causal explanation, it is certainly suggestive that these rapidly evolved changes in individual plasticity patterns are broadly consistent with the expansion in 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic>'s ecological distribution. The coincidence of rapid evolution of adaptations to high-light environments, and the species' spread into high-light habitats in northeastern North America during the same very recent time period, suggests that the evolution of increased plasticity in introduced-range populations of 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> may have contributed to the ecological range expansion of the species in this region.
