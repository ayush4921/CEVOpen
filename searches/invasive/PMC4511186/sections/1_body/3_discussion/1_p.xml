<p>A study of comparable multi-population field datasets indicates that in the 15 years between 1994 and 2009, the introduced Asian annual 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> measurably expanded its ecological range in northeastern North America. In 1994, the species was excluded from high-light as well as flooded habitats and habitat patches (microsites within sites) in this region (

  <italic>et al</italic>. 1998
 </xref>). As of 2009, the distribution of 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> in the same region included sites with increased mean light availability, a higher proportion of high-light microsites, sites with higher average soil moisture and wetter microsites than were occupied by the species in 1994.
