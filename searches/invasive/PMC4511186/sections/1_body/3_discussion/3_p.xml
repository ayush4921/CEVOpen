<p>Comparative data on field distribution cannot be absolutely conclusive, since one cannot exhaustively sample every possible site across a large range. However, the difference described above is unlikely to be an artefact for several reasons. First, the 1994 data on 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic>'s ecological range were collected as part of a multi-species comparison that included annual congeners that did occupy high-light and flooded habitats and habitat patches. Although many such sites in the region were examined in 1994, 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> was not found in 
 <italic>any</italic> open, moist site or habitat patch within a site, which strongly supports the conclusion that 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> did not occur in these conditions in northeastern North America at that time (

  <italic>et al</italic>. 1998
 </xref>). Second, our sampling strategy allowed us to assess the distribution of 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> plants with respect to environmentally distinct microsites within each of the field populations, a key indicator of change in the species' realized ecological niche. Compared with the 1994 dataset, in 2009 a significantly lower proportion of plants occurred in low-light microsites, and a (more than three-fold) higher proportion were found in high-light microsites. Although it could perhaps be argued that the species' new occupancy of open, wet sites might reflect newly successful dispersal into those sites rather than a change in ecological tolerance 
 <italic>per se</italic>, a changed pattern of microsite occupancy 
 <italic>within</italic> field sites could not result from greater dispersal (see 
 <xref rid="PLV038C8" ref-type="bibr">Hargreaves 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2014
 </xref> on the difficulty in many distribution studies of distinguishing dispersal from environmental factors).
