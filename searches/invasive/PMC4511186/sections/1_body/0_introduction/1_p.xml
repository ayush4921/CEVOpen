<p>A non-indigenous species' transition from introduced to invasive is usually marked by the onset of aggressive range expansion (

Despite the abundance of research documenting geographic range expansion in introduced species, little is known about how an introduced species may expand its ecological range, i.e. the set of local environmental conditions in which such a species can successfully establish populations (see
