<p>Ecological range expansion may be a particularly important aspect of the invasion process to document because it can influence future invasion dynamics in two key ways. First, expansion into a broader range of ecological conditions may enhance a species' rate of spread by increasing connectivity among suitable habitats and the probability of dispersal to suitable sites (
