<p>In this study, we measured the range of light, soil moisture and soil nutrient levels in which 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> currently occurs in northeastern North America (2009 field data), and compared these measurements with the species’ ranges of light, moisture and nutrient conditions that were similarly determined 15 years earlier (1994 field data; 
 <xref rid="PLV038C27" ref-type="bibr">Sultan 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 1998
 </xref>). Specifically, we asked the following questions: over the last 15 years, has 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> measurably expanded its ecological range in northeastern North America? If so, does the species occur in habitats from which it was absent in the past (e.g. sunny habitats), and has it shifted its occupancy of different types of microsite within sites? We discuss the potential implications of ecological range expansion on the species’ potential invasive spread, in terms of individual and population performance. Because detailed historical data on the environments inhabited by introduced species are rare, to our knowledge this is the first study that uses comparisons of environmental data across time to assess change in ecological range during an ongoing species invasion.
