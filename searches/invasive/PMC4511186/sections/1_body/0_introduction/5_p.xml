<p>Here we document a measurable change over a recent 15-year period in the ecological range of the Asian annual 
 <italic>Polygonum</italic> (s.l.) 
 <italic>cespitosum</italic> Blume (
 <italic>Persicaria cespitosa</italic>, 
 <xref rid="PLV038C11" ref-type="bibr">Kim 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2008
 </xref>) in northeastern North America, where the species was introduced in the early 1900s (
 <xref rid="PLV038C19" ref-type="bibr">Paterson 2000</xref>). Its tiny achenes are readily dispersed (e.g. in mud and plant debris) and the species has spread rapidly across the continent (it has been reported throughout eastern North America), aided by transport on animal hooves, shoes and vehicle tyres. 
 <italic>Polygonum cespitosum</italic> is of particular interest because it was rather recently introduced in New England (first listed in 1976; 
 <xref rid="PLV038C18" ref-type="bibr">Mehrhoff 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2003
 </xref>) and subsequently has become invasive in this part of its non-native range. Throughout most of its residency in the region, the species has inhabited moderately shaded, moist sites (
 <xref rid="PLV038C27" ref-type="bibr">Sultan 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 1998
 </xref>) similar to those typical of its native Asian range (
 <xref rid="PLV038C2" ref-type="bibr">Anjen 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2003
 </xref>). However, within just the past two decades, 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> populations have been reported in open sites in New England, often forming very dense monocultures (
 <xref rid="PLV038C18" ref-type="bibr">Mehrhoff 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2003
 </xref>). A series of glasshouse studies showed that, during this same time interval, local populations in the species' introduced range have rapidly evolved increased adaptive plasticity in response to high-light conditions (
 <xref rid="PLV038C28" ref-type="bibr">Sultan 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2013
 </xref>). This intriguing scenario suggests that the species might be undergoing an expansion of its ecological range to include open habitats, and that this change in ecological breadth could be contributing to its recent transition to invasiveness.
