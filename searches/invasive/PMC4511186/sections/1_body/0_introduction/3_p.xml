<p>A number of ecological and evolutionary processes can lead to changes in a species' ecological range (see 
 <xref rid="PLV038C10" ref-type="bibr">Holt 2003</xref>). Expansion can occur after a species is introduced to a new region if its populations in that region evolve broader individual repertoires of adaptive plasticity to contrasting conditions (e.g.

 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="PLV038C17" ref-type="bibr">Matesanz 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2010
 </xref>). Indeed, selection in the disturbed, heterogeneous environments typically colonized by introduced species may favour the evolution of such increased plasticity, which may in turn allow an introduced species to spread into a wider range of habitats (

  <italic>et al</italic>. 2013
 </xref>). Alternatively, ecological range expansion may occur if geographically separate populations become locally adapted to diverse habitats, if genotypes from distinct habitats in a speciesâ€™ home range are brought in over time via multiple introductions (
 <xref rid="PLV038C5" ref-type="bibr">Dlugosch and Parker 2008</xref>), or due to non-evolutionary processes, such as changes in community composition that facilitate a introduced species' occupancy of previously unsuitable habitats (
 <xref rid="PLV038C8" ref-type="bibr">Hargreaves 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2014
 </xref>). For instance, populations of the Atlantic coast shore-grass
