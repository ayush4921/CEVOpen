<p>Both the sunniest and second sunniest sites in 2009 had a significantly higher proportion of high-light microsites than the sunniest site from 1994 (
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.001 and 
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.001); in 1994, the sunniest site had 21 and 4 % of microsites, &gt;80 % PAR, at canopy and mid-canopy height, respectively, compared with 45 and 15 % of microsites, respectively, at the sunniest site in 2009 (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV038F4">4</xref>A and B). The shadiest sites from 1994 and 2009 did not differ significantly in the proportion of high-light microsites (
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.552); at the shadiest population in 1994, no microsites at either canopy or mid-canopy level received &gt;80 % of available PAR, while in 2009, at the shadiest site 5 % of microsites at canopy height and 0.4 % of microsites at mid-canopy height received &gt;80 % PAR (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV038F4">4</xref>A and B). Neither the sunniest sites from both years nor the shadiest sites from both years differed significantly in the proportion of low-light microsites (
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.447 and 
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.081, respectively).
