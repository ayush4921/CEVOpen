<p>In 1994, mean light availability at 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> populations ranged from 5 to 32 % at canopy height, and from 2 to 17 % at mid-canopy height (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV038F3">3</xref>A). In 2009, mean light availability ranged from 12 to 49 % at canopy height and from 7 to 34 % at mid-canopy. Both the site with highest mean light availability (‘sunniest population’) and second sunniest 2009 populations had significantly higher mean light availability than the sunniest site in 1994 (
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.001 and 
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.007, respectively). In contrast, there was no significant difference in mean light levels between the site with lowest mean light availability (‘shadiest population’) in 1994 and the shadiest population in 2009 (
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.143). In both 1994 and 2009, plants occurred in very low-light microsites (&lt;10 % available PAR at canopy height) as well as high-light microsites (&gt;80 % available PAR at canopy height) (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV038F3">3</xref>B), but in 2009 a lower proportion of plants occurred in low-light microsites (55 vs. 70 %), and a higher proportion of plants were found in high-light microsites (17 vs. 5 %) (Fig.
