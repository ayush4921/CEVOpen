<p>In 2009, 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic>'s ecological range included sites with higher average soil moisture than those it inhabited in 1994, as well as wetter microsites (Table 
 <xref rid="PLV038TB1" ref-type="table">1</xref>; Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV038F2">2</xref>). In 1994, mean soil moisture at 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> populations (% of field capacity for each site's soil) ranged from 35 to 59 %, while in 2009 mean soil moisture ranged from 47 % to over 140 % (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV038F2">2</xref>A). Both the wettest and second wettest 2009 sites had significantly higher mean soil moisture than the wettest site from 1994 (linear contrasts 
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.001 and 
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.006 respectively; Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV038F2">2</xref>A). Similarly, 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> inhabited a wider range of soil moisture microsites in 2009 than in 1994. Whereas in 1994, 95 % of all microsites sampled in 
 <italic>Polygonum</italic> populations had soil moisture between 19 and 93 % of field capacity, in 2009 this 95 % microsite range extended from 23 to 206 % of field capacity (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV038F2">2</xref>B). Surprisingly, 25 % of all microsites sampled in 2009 had higher soil moisture than any microsite sampled in 1994. The difference in mean soil moisture between the driest site in 1994 (35 % of field capacity) and in 2009 (47 % of field capacity) was not significant (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.136).
