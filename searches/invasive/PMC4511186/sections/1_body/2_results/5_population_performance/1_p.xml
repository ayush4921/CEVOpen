<p>At the late sampling date in 2009, population-mean soil moisture was positively correlated with mean leaf number (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.848, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.002), mean inflorescence number (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.880, 
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.001) and mean reproductive output (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.864, 
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.001); and negatively correlated with mean population density (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.576, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.081). These correlations were disproportionately influenced by one population with very high soil moisture (see Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV038F2">2</xref>A), and were no longer significant (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.2) when this population was removed from the analysis.
