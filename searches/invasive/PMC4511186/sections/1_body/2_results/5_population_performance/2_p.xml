<p>Light availability (quantified as GSF) was positively correlated with several indicators of individual and population performance. At the early sampling date, population-mean GSF was positively correlated with the proportion of individuals flowering (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.800, 
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.001), mean plant height (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.866, 
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.001) and mean leaf number (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.658, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.014). At the late sampling date, population-mean GSF was positively correlated with mean plant height (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.937, 
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.001), mean leaf number (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.769, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.009), mean inflorescence number (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.667, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.035) and mean reproductive output (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.729, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.017), as well as mean 
 <italic>Polygonum</italic> cover (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.578, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.080) and mean reproductive output per unit area (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.758, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.011). See
