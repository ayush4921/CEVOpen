<p>In both years, 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> populations were found in sandy loam soils that included a very broad range of soil nutrient levels. The range of soil pH and nutrient values was generally similar in 1994 and 2009 (5.1–7.4 and 5.1–6.7 in 1994 and 2009, respectively). In both years, population-mean CEC values fell within the moderate-optimal range and were typical for soils found in the study region (1.8–18.0 and 3.8–19.0 meq/100 g in 1994 and 2009, respectively). Ranges of values for individual soil nutrients were also broadly similar between 1994 and 2009: nitrate concentration was low to moderate in both 1994 and 2009 (5.4–23.6 and 10.0–15.0 ppm); Potassium levels ranged from low to high in 1994 (56–192 ppm) but were low in 2009 (55–72 ppm); calcium levels ranged from very low to optimum in both years (320–1895 and 246–1336 ppm in 1994 and 2009, respectively). Magnesium content ranged from very low to above optimal in both years (27–303 and 26–180 ppm in 1994 and 2009, respectively), and phosphorous contents ranged from very low to either optimal or excessive in both years as well.
