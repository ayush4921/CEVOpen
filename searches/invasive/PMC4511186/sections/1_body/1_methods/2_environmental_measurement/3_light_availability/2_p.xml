<p>In 2009, the species’ range of light conditions was also quantified using hemispherical photography, a method of directly quantifying canopy closure to infer light availability based on the sun's trajectory. At each population site, at both early and late sampling dates, 15 photographs spaced &gt;1 m apart were taken at 
 <italic>Polygonum</italic> canopy height with a Nikon Coolpix 900 camera and Nikon FCE8 180° hemispherical lens (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). A hand-held level and magnetic compass were used to orient the camera. Photographs were analysed with HemiView version 2.1 (Delta-T Devices, Ltd, Cambridge, UK), with light/dark thresholds selected based on the photograph's lighting and individually checked for each image to ensure consistent analysis. Global site factor (GSF), an indicator of photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) received during a day compared with PPFD at a completely unobstructed site, was calculated as (0.9 × direct site factor + 0.1 × indirect site factor) (

 </xref>). Mean and median sunfleck durations (interval of direct insolation) were calculated for each photograph. Calculations of the Sun's trajectory were made for 1 July (early sampling date photographs) and 25 August (late sampling date photographs). Comparisons of the percentage of total available PAR calculated from the 
 <italic>in situ</italic> measurements to the mean GSF for each site calculated with hemispherical photography rendered very similar results.
