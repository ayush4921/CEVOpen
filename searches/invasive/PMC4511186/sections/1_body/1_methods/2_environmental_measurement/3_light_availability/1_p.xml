<p>Instantaneous light availability was measured on sunny days between 1030 and 1600 hours using an Accupar LP-80 sunfleck ceptometer (Decagon Devices, WA, USA). Each data point consisted of the mean of 10 adjacent PAR sensors spaced 1 cm apart along a 0.8 m transect, giving eight data points per transect. At each population site, on each sampling date, a total of 15–16 transects covering the spatial extent of the population were established at both 
 <italic>Polygonum</italic> canopy height (∼20–30 cm aboveground level) and one-half of canopy height (10–15 cm), for a total of 240–256 data points per population site per date (8 data points per sample × 15–16 samples per population × 2 heights). Measurements were converted to a percentage of total available PAR in full sun (PAR intensity at a separate quantum sensor placed in the nearest fully insolated location and wired to the ceptometer). To characterize the distribution of high- and low-light microsites, the proportion of measurements with &gt;80 % available PAR and &lt;10 % available PAR was calculated for each sample of eight measurements from each transect for each site and date.
