<p>Soil pH, nutrient content and structural properties were determined from six soil samples per population site, depth (0–10 cm or 20–30 cm) and sampling date, sampled from across each population site as for soil moisture (see above; 
 <italic>N</italic> = 24 per site). Samples from the same population, depth and sampling date were combined for analysis (four combined samples per site). Soil tests were performed at the University of Massachusetts Amherst Soil and Plant Tissue Testing Lab (
