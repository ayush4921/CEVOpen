<p>Soil moisture (percentage of field capacity) was determined gravimetrically at both early and late sampling dates for each population site, from samples taken at 0–10 cm depth and 20–30 cm depth. A soil core sampler was used to collect individual samples from 8 to 10 evenly spaced microsites per soil depth per population roughly evenly spaced across the spatial extent of the site area. To ensure comparable sampling conditions, all samples were collected at least 3 days after the most recent rainfall. Soil moisture content was calculated as the percentage of soil mass lost after oven-drying at 70 °C to constant weight. Soil moisture content was then converted to a percentage of field capacity (a proxy for soil water potential) which was determined separately for each site soil and sample depth by weighing, drying at 65 °C for 48 h, and reweighing soil that had been fully saturated with water and allowed to drain overnight (
