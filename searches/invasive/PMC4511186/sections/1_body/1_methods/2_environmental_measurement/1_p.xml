<p>To determine the species' environmental distribution among as well as within sites, we collected environmental data at the five representative population sites in each year. In order to further ensure comparability of the environmental measurements in both years, the same field protocols were followed (see below). For both years, field measurements were made both (i) during seedling establishment and juvenile growth (23 June–6 July 1994 and 28 June–15 July 2009; early sampling date) and (ii) during peak of achene (seed) production by mature plants (25 August–3 September 1994 and 31 August–15 September 2009; late sampling date). In both 1994 and 2009 the early sampling date was well after tree leaf expansion, and the late sampling date was before the onset of autumn leaf fall, so measurements were taken at comparable points in the growth season across years.</p>
