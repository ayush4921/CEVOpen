<p>In 2009, for each population we measured 
 <italic>Polygonum</italic> individual plant height, leaf number and reproductive output, as well as population density, cover and phenology (proportion of flowering individuals) at both early and late sampling dates. At each sampling date, 10 circular plots (0.5 m diameter) were haphazardly selected across the population. In each plot, all leaves and inflorescences were counted from a single, randomly selected 
 <italic>Polygonum</italic> plant. Also, all 
 <italic>Polygonum</italic> flowering and non-flowering individuals were counted, and 
 <italic>Polygonum</italic> cover was estimated by two independent observers. At the late sampling date, all inflorescences from a single plant in each plot were collected, air-dried and weighed to estimate total individual reproductive output. Reproductive output per square metre was estimated as individual reproductive output Ã— population density (based on the late sampling date measurements).
