<p>In order to rigorously compare the recent (2009) ecological range of the species with its earlier (1994) ecological range, we precisely quantified the highest and lowest levels of insolation, soil moisture and macronutrient conditions in which viable populations of the species were found (see 
 <xref rid="PLV038C4" ref-type="bibr">Colwell and Futuyma 1971</xref>). In 1994 and 2009, more than 50 field sites were examined in a common geographic area extending from southwestern Connecticut to northern and central Massachusetts (an area of ∼40 000 km
 <sup>2</sup>). This initial examination covered the complete range of habitat types in which annual plants occur in Northeastern North America, including a broad variety of naturally and artificially disturbed habitats such as forest paths and trails, road embankments and meadows. For each year, based on environmental measurements taken at 14–18 
 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> sites chosen from this initial large sample (details below), five disjunct natural populations of the species, consisting of at least 100 individuals, were chosen to encompass the full range of conditions occupied. Hence, the final population sample in each year reflected the highest and lowest resource levels revealed in an initially large, random sample of field populations. Importantly, environmental conditions (daily precipitation for the months previous to data collection as well as annual precipitation) of the study years when the environmental measurements were performed were very similar (differences in spring–summer and annual precipitation between 1994 and 2009 were &lt;4 %)
