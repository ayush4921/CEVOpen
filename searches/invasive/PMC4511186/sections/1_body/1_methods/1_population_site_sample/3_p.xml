<p>In 2009, a similar protocol was followed to sample 14 field populations across the region, and a subsample of five populations was identified that represented the species’ current ecological range (i.e. the sites with lowest and highest mean light availability, GAY and HAR), the sites with lowest and highest soil moisture (ARM and HAR) and two sites with intermediate values of both light availability and soil moisture and very different plant community composition (WAD and WYA) (details in Fig.
