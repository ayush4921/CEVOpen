 </ext-link>), and plant community composition. From this initial set of 18 populations, the five populations in sites most different from one another were selected for detailed investigation as representing the range of environmental conditions across which the species occurred. This subset included the sites with highest and lowest light availability (TP1 and ARL), highest and lowest soil moisture (TP1 and RW) and the sites with intermediate light and moisture conditions but contrasting mixtures of herbaceous and woody plant species (ORD and WEI; see Fig.

 <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> was absent, and therefore, any measured increase in ecological range between years was not likely due to incomplete sampling in 1994.
