<p>To test for ecological range expansion, linear contrasts were used comparing the most extreme site in 1994 to the most extreme site in 2009 for each factor (e.g. the contrast tested for a significant difference between the driest site in 1994 and the driest site in 2009, etc.). In cases where the contrast showed a significant change in the most extreme site for a given environmental factor, the second most extreme site from the year with the broader range was compared with the most extreme site from the year with the narrower range to verify that the measured change in ecological range was not due to sampling an extremely unusual site by chance. Linear correlation analyses were used to assess the correlations of individual and population performance (leaf number, reproductive output, density, cover, proportion of individuals flowering, reproductive output per square meter) with environmental variables (soil moisture and GSF) in 2009. All analyses were performed in JMP v 7 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).</p>
