  <p>Location of field sites sampled in northeastern North America. The light grey area delimits the extent of the initial sampling area, which included more than 50 disjunct field sites encompassing all annual-plant habitats. The 18 yellow and 14 green dots represent the randomly chosen subset of sites measured in 1994 and 2009, respectively. Labelled dots represent the five sites used as the structured sample for each year, as explained in the Methods section. See
