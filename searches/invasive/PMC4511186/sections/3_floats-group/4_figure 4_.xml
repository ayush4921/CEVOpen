  <p>Changes in the frequency of high- and low-light microsites in the introduced range of 
   <italic>P. cespitosum</italic>. Shown are means + 1SE at five populations representing 
   <italic>P. cespitosum</italic>'s ecological range in northeastern North America in 1994 and 2009 for (A) the percentage of high-light microsites at canopy height, (B) the percentage of high-light microsites at mid-canopy height, (C) the percentage of low-light microsites at canopy height, and (D) the percentage of low-light microsites at mid-canopy height. Data from both sampling dates are pooled (for details, see Methods).
