  <p>Expansion in soil moisture conditions occupied by 
   <italic>P. cespitosum</italic> in its introduced range. (A) Box plots (10th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th percentile) and means (dark line) for soil moisture (% of field capacity) at five populations representing 
   <italic>P. cespitosum</italic>'s ecological range in northeastern North America in 1994 (left) and 2009 (right). (B) The percentage of microsites by soil moisture availability in 1994 and 2009. Data from both depths and sampling dates were pooled.
