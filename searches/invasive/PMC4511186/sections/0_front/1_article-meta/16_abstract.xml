 <p>Many studies track the geographic spread of invasive plants, but little is known about how such species may expand the range of environments in which they can successfully establish populations-- the 
  <italic>ecological range.</italic> This paper documents a significant expansion over a recent 15-year period in the range of light and moisture conditions inhabited by the Asian annual 
  <italic>Polygonum cespitosum</italic> Blume in northeastern North America. The species' increased ecological breadth is coincident with its more aggressive spread in the region.
