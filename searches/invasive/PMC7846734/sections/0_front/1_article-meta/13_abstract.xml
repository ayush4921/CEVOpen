 <p id="Par1">African horticulture is seriously affected by fruit flies, both native and invasive. Novel sustainable control methods need testing against the backdrop of smallholder-dominated farming of Africa. We evaluated the potential of male-specific attractants (parapheromones) laced with insecticide to suppress the alien invasive 
  <italic>Bactrocera dorsalis</italic> and native 
  <italic>Ceratitis capitata</italic>. In large-scale guava, methyl-eugenol (ME)-bait stations combined with toxic protein baits suppressed 
  <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> within 8Â months but resulted in a resurgence of the displaced 
  <italic>Ceratitis capitata</italic>. In smallholder farms, intervention using SPLAT-ME laced with spinosad was surprisingly unsuccessful. Subsequent mark-release-recapture experiments showed high dispersal rates of flies, covering many times a typical farm size, leading to a continuous influx of flies from surrounding areas. Several other factors important for intervention were evaluated. SPLAT-MAT-ME dollops remained attractive for over two weeks, although gradually becoming less attractive than fresh baits. Further, competitive displacement was observed: 
  <italic>C. capitata</italic> selectively emerged from fruits in which 
  <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> infestation was low. Finally, we evaluated whether ME could be combined with 
  <italic>C. capitata</italic> male attractants [trimedlure (TML) and terpinyl acetate (TA)] without affecting attraction. Combining male lures did not affect catches directly, although at very high populations of 
  <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> attracted to ME interfered with 
  <italic>C. capitata</italic> trap entry. Although ME-based methods can effectively suppress 
  <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>, they were not effective at single smallholder scale due to the high dispersive propensity of tephritids. Further, competitive release implies the need for a combination of lures and methods. These observations are important for developing control schemes tailored for African smallholder settings.
