 <caption>
  <p>Number of adult 
   <italic>C. capitata</italic> and 
   <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> emerging from guava, mango (two cultivars), and orange collected in Arba-Minch. The left part of the graph shows emergence from fruits prior to 
   <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> invasion (only in guava), whereas right part of the graph shows emergence after invasion of 
   <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>. Tukey’s boxplots indicate the median, the 25 and 75 percentile boundaries (box), and 1.5 times the interquartile (IQ) range (whiskers). Dots represent outliers outside the 1.5 IQ range. Different letters/letter cases indicate a difference in fruit fly emergence per kg of fruit per host, with capital letters representing 
   <italic>C. capitata</italic> and small letters representing 
   <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>. Statistics were performed using a general linear model with a poisson distribution, n = 8, *** represents differences between species at p ≤ 0.001.
