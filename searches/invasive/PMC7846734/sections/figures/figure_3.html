 <caption> The average number of blue and green-marked male B. dorsalis recaptured per position. Fruit flies were either released 3 days before (green) or after trap set up (blue) from the central position (red dot). Light-shaded areas indicate the perimeters of the smallholder farms in which traps were placed. Concentric dotted circles indicate the distances from the release point (250, 500, 750 and 1000 m). For comparison, the red circle indicates the approximate size of the guava farm in a commercial farm Upper Awash. Note the lake at around 150 m east from the release point. Top inset: violin plot showing the range of temperatures at 12 noon during the observation period with an average temperature in a dashed line. Middle inset: the modified bucket trap for collecting flies for marking. Flies could not reach the methyl eugenol bait. Bottom inset: prevailing wind direction and strength (red line demarcates wind strength between calm and moderate). For visualization purposes a map was produced using the average trap catch average per location and the package ggmap, a wrapper for ggplot2 (Version:3.0.0, URL: http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) was used for accessing the google API and downloading the map for subsequent mapping 28 , temperature and wind data was gathered using the package WeatherData 29 , where a temperature set was filtered for 12:00 h local time. The map was annotated with each of the orchards and trap position and concentric circles representing the distances from release point. </caption>
