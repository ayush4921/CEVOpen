 <caption> Comparison of catches of B. dorsalis and C. capitata with lures baited with different male attractants in both large-scale commercial orchards (UAAIE, A), and smallholder orchards (Arba-Minch, B). Statistics were performed using a generalized linear mixed model using a negative binomial distribution and by taking the variable “week” as random effect. Capital and lower-case letters are used to show statistically significant differences for different species, capital letters are used for C. capitata and small letters are used for B. dorsalis. </caption>
