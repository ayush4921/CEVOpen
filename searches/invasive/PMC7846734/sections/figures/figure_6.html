 <caption> Number of adult C. capitata and B. dorsalis emerging from guava, mango (two cultivars), and orange collected in Arba-Minch. The left part of the graph shows emergence from fruits prior to B. dorsalis invasion (only in guava), whereas right part of the graph shows emergence after invasion of B. dorsalis. Tukey’s boxplots indicate the median, the 25 and 75 percentile boundaries (box), and 1.5 times the interquartile (IQ) range (whiskers). Dots represent outliers outside the 1.5 IQ range. Different letters/letter cases indicate a difference in fruit fly emergence per kg of fruit per host, with capital letters representing C. capitata and small letters representing B. dorsalis. Statistics were performed using a general linear model with a poisson distribution, n = 8, *** represents differences between species at p ≤ 0.001. </caption>
