  <p>Field life of dollops containing methyl eugenol (ME). Capture of 
   <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> males in traps baited with ME lures of different age (in days since application in orchard). Dollops of ME + spinosad were aged on mango leaves for 1, 5, 7, 15 and 30 days. Traps were either placed in proximity (at ~ 1 m distance and under the same canopy, i.e. in competition with each other), or at 30 m distance from each other.
