 </sup>. The relative economic impact is perhaps strongest felt by smallholder farming families that count on the small-scale sales of high-value crops to significantly contribute to the family economics. Pest management and control strategies should thus be amenable to both large-scale productions and small-scale farming, with emphasis on the latter. However, little is known about the potential of adoption and utilization of fruit fly control techniques in smallholder farming settings.
