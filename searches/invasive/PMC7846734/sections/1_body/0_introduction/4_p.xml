<p id="Par5">Various management techniques exist that can be used in fruit fly suppression, of which orchard sanitation and toxic bait sprays (e.g. GF-120

 </sup>), are mainstays. Of the upcoming techniques that have a good potential of adoption by the East African farming community is the use of male attractants in a form called male annihilation technique (MAT), which selectively removes males from a population and thereby reduces the percentage of fertile females and oviposition. The technique makes use of the fact that males of many tephritid fruit flies are strongly attracted to certain chemical compounds, the ecological importance and evolutionary origin of which is only partially understood

 </sup>. These male-specific attractants, frequently referred to as parapheromones, can be used in combination with killing agents, such as spinosad, to reduce a population from a given area through male annihilation

 <italic>Ceratitis</italic> species, are attracted to trimedlure (TML) and terpinyl acetate (TA)
