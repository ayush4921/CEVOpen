<p id="Par24">The mark-release-recapture data shows that both green (released 3 days prior to placing recapture traps) and blue-marked flies (released 24 h prior to trap deployment) were recaptured from traps at all distances and directions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). A total of 386 (2.96%) green and a total of 763 (6.6%) blue-marked 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> flies were recaptured from all releases (13,033 green-marked and 11,528 blue-marked). Of the marked flies, 11.1% ± 1.2 remained in the release bucket for longer than one hour and were excluded from the study. Flies dispersed distances many times the typical size of smallholder farms and throughout the study area, despite having ME traps at or nearby the release plot (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The number of recaptured flies significantly decreased with distance from the release point (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Whether traps were placed shortly after (blue flies) or 3 days after release (green-marked flies) dispersal distance was similar (r
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.71, F(1,46) = 112.7, p &lt; 0.001, and r2 = 0.71, F(1,46) = 112.4, p &lt; 0.001, resp.), indicating placement of traps directly following release of flies did not lead to an underestimation of dispersive propensity. A weak negative correlation was found in the number of unmarked flies caught at different distances (r
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.24, F (1,44) = 13.69, p &lt; 0.001). Temperature was constant and the wind was ‘calm’ (less than 0.5 m/s) for most of the time (Fig.
