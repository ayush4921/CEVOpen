<p id="Par14">To determine potential competitive displacement and resource partitioning of 
 <italic>C. capitata</italic>, ripe fruits from, guava, 
 <italic>P. guajava</italic>, orange, 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic> and exotic &amp; local varieties of mango, 
 <italic>M. indica</italic> were randomly sampled from intervention treated plot in Arba-Minch. Sampling was performed from March to June 2015. Trees from each host fruit were randomly selected and variable numbers of fruits with oviposition marks were collected depending on availability and fruiting season. In total, 1440 local mango, 1440 guava, 624 orange and 360 exotic mango fruits were sampled and weighed. Samples were transferred to the laboratory at Arba-Minch plant health clinic and placed in plastic containers (12 × 22 × 30 cm) on a dry sand layer (1–2 cm deep). Depending on the size of the fruits, 5–10 fruits were placed in each plastic container. Fruits were transferred to other plastic containers every 3 days. Pupae recovered from sands were transferred to bug dorm cages (30 × 30 × 30 cm) for identification of emerging fruit fly adults.
