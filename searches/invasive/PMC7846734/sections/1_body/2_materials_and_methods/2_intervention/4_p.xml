<p id="Par11">In small-scale farms between 2015-04-05 and 2016-07-04 we tested a ME-based attract-and-kill formulation for suppressing the dominant species 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>. Dollops of ME (20% ME, 2% spinosad) were applied in six plots, whereas dollops of ME (20%) without spinosad were applied in two control plots. Each plot was approximately 1 ha in size. Even though the plots consisted of many different potential host plants, such as papaya, orange and guava, the mango dominated the plots with between 80 and 147 trees per plot. A dollop (~ 3 g) was manually applied on a shaded leaf at the lower part of the canopy of each mango tree. Population levels of both species (
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> and 
 <italic>C. capitata</italic>) were monitored weekly in each plot by deploying nine traps baited with CML (combined male lure, consisting of 20% ME + 10% TA + 10% TML + 5% sugar + 2% spinosad) for 24 h. Every month, treated leaves were removed, buried and replaced with fresh dollops.
