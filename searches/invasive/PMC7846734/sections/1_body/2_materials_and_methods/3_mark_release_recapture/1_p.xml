<p id="Par12">A mark release recapture (MRR) study was conducted in Arba-Minch between 2016-04-12 and 2016-08-25, in small-scale farming settings. To collect males for marking, modified traps were constructed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> middle inset), such that male flies could be collected with ME without them contacting the lure. Collected flies were immobilized by placing the buckets in iceboxes for 30–40 min and counted. Flies were marked by spraying one of two different colors (blue &amp; green) of readmission ink (Blak-Ray UVP Inc, Upland California, USA). After marking, the flies were allowed to leave the bucket for one hour between 1500 and 1600 h. Flies that did not take off were counted and subtracted from the total number of flies released. The MRR experiment was designed in order to assess the magnitude of dispersal of the fruit flies. Eight traps were used in the release plot, while five traps were placed in each of seven other plots and five traps were placed as far away as 1 km from the release point to assess long range dispersal. Two colors were used to assess the dispersal of flies. A group of green-marked flies was released, followed by blue-marked flies three days later. Seventy-two hours after the release of the green-marked flies, methyl eugenol-baits were deployed to recapture dispersed flies. We argued that if we would place ME traps directly after release, dispersal would have been inhibited. So, the green marked flies (released before traps were deployed) served for getting a potentially more accurate measure of the dispersion rate, giving flies the time to disperse first, while the blue marked flies would, we assumed, result in a higher recapture rate. The releases of marked flies were repeated three times with a month interval between 2016-08-25 and 2016-04-22. For each set of release trap captures were analyzed every 5 days for 30 days. Colors of marked flies were identified using an ultraviolet flashlight torch (TOPCOM, TP-7312DUV, Zhejiang, China). Experiments were performed when no other experiments were ongoing in the area.
