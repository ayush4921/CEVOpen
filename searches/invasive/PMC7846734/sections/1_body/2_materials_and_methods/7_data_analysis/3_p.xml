<p id="Par18">Lure longevity was assessed for traps placed at 30 m distance as well as in close proximity (1 m) and for each lure ‘age’ using a generalized linear mixed model (glm) fitted with a negative binomial distribution (study week as random effect), this was followed by a Tukey’s all-pairwise comparison to determine differences between differently aged lures. Akaike’s information criteria (AIC) values as well as patterns of residual values were used to determine normality and the best fitting model/distribution.</p>
