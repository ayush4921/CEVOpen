  <title>Background</title>
  <p>As a means of biologically controlling 
   <italic>Mikania micrantha</italic> H.B.K. in Yunnan, China, the influence of sweet potato [
   <italic>Ipomoea batatas</italic> (L.) Lam.] on its reproductive characteristics was studied. The trial utilized a de Wit replacement series incorporating six ratios of sweet potato and 
   <italic>M. micrantha</italic> plants in 25 m
   <sup>2</sup> plots over 2 years.

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>Budding of 
   <italic>M. micrantha</italic> occurred at the end of September; flowering and fruiting occurred from October to February. Flowering phenology of 
   <italic>M. micrantha</italic> was delayed (P &lt; 0.05), duration of flowering and fruiting was reduced (P &lt; 0.05) and duration of bud formation was increased (P &lt; 0.05) with increasing proportions of sweet potato. Reproductive allocation, reproductive investment and reproductive index of 
   <italic>M. micrantha</italic> were significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.05) with increasing sweet potato densities. Apidae bees, and Calliphoridae or Syrphidae flies were the most abundant visitors to 
   <italic>M. micrantha</italic> flowers. Overall flower visits decreased (P &lt; 0.05) as sweet potato increased. Thus the mechanism by which sweet potato suppressed sexual reproduction in 
   <italic>M. micrantha</italic> was essentially two-fold: causing a delay in flowering phenology and reducing pollinator visits. The number, biomass, length, set rate, germination rate, and 1000-grain dry weight of 
   <italic>M. micrantha</italic> seeds were suppressed (P &lt; 0.05) by sweet potato competition. With proportional increases in sweet potato, sexual and asexual seedling populations of 
   <italic>M. micrantha</italic> were significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.05). The mortality of both seedling types increased (P &lt; 0.05) with proportional increases in sweet potato.

  <title>Conclusions</title>
  <p>These results suggest that sweet potato significantly suppresses the reproductive ability of the invasive species 
   <italic>M. micrantha</italic>, and is a promising alternative to traditional biological control and other methods of control. Planting sweet potato in conjunction with other control methods could provide a comprehensive strategy for managing 
   <italic>M. micrantha</italic>. The scenario of controlling 
   <italic>M. micrantha</italic> by utilizing a crop with a similar growth form may provide a useful model for similar management strategies in other systems.
