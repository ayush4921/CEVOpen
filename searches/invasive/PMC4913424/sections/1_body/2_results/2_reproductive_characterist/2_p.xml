<p>For a ratio of sweet potato to 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> of 3:1, the number and biomass of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> seeds were reduced by a factor of more than 100 compared to 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> in monoculture, i.e., 17,632.6 ± 479.8 vs. 171.7 ± 4.3 and 1.772 ± 0.042 g vs. 0.014 ± 0.000 g, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). The number, biomass, length, set rate, germination rate, and 1000-grain dry weight of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> seeds were significantly suppressed (P &lt; 0.05) with decreasing proportions of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic>.
