<p>In monoculture, the biomass of plant, inflorescences and flowers of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> was 301.61 ± 5.19 g, 54.66 ± 1.14 g, and 40.99 ± 1.01 g, respectively; the inflorescence and flower numbers of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> were 2647.8 ± 55.3 and 10,587.7 ± 239.3, respectively. In mixed culture, the total biomass of plant, biomass of inflorescences and flowers, and numbers of inflorescences and flowers of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) suppressed with decreasing proportions of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). With proportional increases in sweet potato, reproductive allocation, reproductive investment and reproductive index of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> were significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05). The reproductive ratio of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> did not differ significantly among treatments (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). With decreasing proportions of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic>, the reproductive efficiency index of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> was reduced to a certain extent by sweet potato but the trend was not clear.
