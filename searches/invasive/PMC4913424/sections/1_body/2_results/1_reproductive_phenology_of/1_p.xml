<p>Budding of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> occurred at the end of September, and flowering and fruiting occurred from October to February in our study area (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The peak bloom occurred between mid-November and early December. Fruiting started as early as the end of November, and almost all fruits had dropped by early February. The flowers opened throughout the day, but the majority did so in the morning. In monoculture, the duration of bud formation, flowers and fruits of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> was 27.25 ± 0.05 d, 79.75 ± 1.71 d, and 75.75 ± 1.71 d, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). With increased sweet potato: 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> ratios, the initial date of budding, flowering and fruiting of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> was significantly delayed, and the duration of flowering and fruiting of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> significantly declined, but duration of bud formation of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> was markedly increased (P &lt; 0.05).
