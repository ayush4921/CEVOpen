<p>Sexual seedling populations of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> germinated for 6 months (March–August), primarily occurring between May–June. Asexual seedling populations first arose in March, and then increased in density monthly from March to October. In monoculture, sexual population and asexual population densities were 89.25 ± 4.35 m
 <sup>−2</sup> and 134.75 ± 4.99 m
 <sup>−2</sup>, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). During growth some seedlings died; the sexual seedlings mostly died from May–June, and asexual seedlings did so between July–September. In all treatments, the asexual seedling population was comprised significantly higher densities (P &lt; 0.05) than the sexual seedling population, and the asexual mortality rate was much lower (P &lt; 0.05) than sexual mortality rate. With proportional increases in sweet potato, the total population, sexual population and asexual population of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> significantly declined (P &lt; 0.05); higher seedling mortality rates were also associated with greater proportions of sweet potato.
