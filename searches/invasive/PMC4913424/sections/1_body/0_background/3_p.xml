<p>To explore ecological methods for managing 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic>, biological control measures through replacement control with high value species (e.g., local food, native species and/or cash crops) have been investigated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In 2006 and 2007, sweet potato [
 <italic>Ipomoea batatas</italic> (L.) Lam.: Convolvulaceae], an important locally grown cash crop native to the American tropics, was observed to inhibit 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> growth in Longchuan County of Yunnan Province, China in sweet potato fields where 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> occurred [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Subsequent studies examined the effects of a local crop, sweet potato, on 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> growth and soil nutrients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Sweet potato exhibited greater competitive ability than 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic>, with plant height, branch, leaf, stem node, adventitious root, and biomass of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> suppressed significantly; furthermore sweet potato also demonstrated higher levels of nutrient uptake than 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic>. Moreover, flowering of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> was significantly suppressed in mixed culture with sweet potato and with decreasing proportions of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic>, the competitiveness of sweet potato increased at a rate exceeding what would be predicted by the increase in relative density [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, no literature is available on the effects of sweet potato competition on the entire suite of reproductive characteristics of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic>.
