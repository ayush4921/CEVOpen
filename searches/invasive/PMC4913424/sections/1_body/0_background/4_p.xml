<p>Building on our former studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], the present research examined how sweet potato suppressed reproductive characteristics of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> in Yunnan Province, China. Previous reports did not refer to impacts on reproductive characteristics, so this is the first report of how sweet potato competition affects characteristics such as flowering and seed production in 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic>. These findings are important to further elucidate the competitive interaction and mechanisms between sweet potato and 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> and provide insights for similar ecological control methods that could be applied to other invasive alien species.
