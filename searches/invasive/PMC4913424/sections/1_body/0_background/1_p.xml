<p>Plant invasions have received attention on a global scale. Invasive plants have caused great economic harm, biodiversity loss, environmental problems, and even human and animal health issues [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, mechanical measures may potentially accelerate invasions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], chemical measures can be detrimental to non-target species and environment health [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and traditional biological control measures via introduction of pathogens, parasites, and predators against invaders are expensive and pose risks to ecosystem integrity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Thus, as a potential alternative to traditional biological control which generally employs insects or pathogens, replacement control relies on growth characteristics of one or more plants to suppress exotic plants, simultaneously reducing damage caused by the invasive species and improving local natural ecosystem health by reducing the potential for invasive plants to spread beyond agricultural fields. Adoption of this alternative method has received considerable attention in recent years [
