 <italic>Mikania micrantha</italic> is one of the most serious invasive species in Longchuan County where this study took place. This perennial weed exhibits a climbing growth form in forests, orchards and shrublands, but on roadsides, in open wasteland areas without crops, and other areas without woody vegetation, it takes on a prostrate form. It has infested sugarcane, orange, banana, coffee, pineapple, bamboo, sweet potato, maize crops, as well as artificial pasture and secondary forest in the study area [
