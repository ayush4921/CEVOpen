<p>From October 2014 to February 2015, flowering and fruiting phenology were recorded at 3Â days intervals for 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic>, including the dates of initial and last budding, flowering, fruiting and seed set. During peak flowering times, we marked 20 inflorescences of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> in each plot and recorded the number of flower visits per insect visitor on each inflorescence between 9:00 and 18:00 (time of maximum pollinator activity) for two continuous days with all plots monitored simultaneously over the same two days. According to [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] each flower visitor was classified as belonging to Apidae, Calliphoridae, Syrphidae (generally the most frequent visitors to 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic>), or another pollinator group beyond these three taxa. At the same time, twenty plants of each species were selected randomly and harvested within the middle region of each plot. 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> plants were carefully removed and separated, and number of inflorescences and flowers were recorded. The fresh weight of inflorescences and flowers and total biomass of each 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> plant were measured. On 28 January 2015, seed production of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> was measured in the study plots after flowering had waned, but prior to seed dispersal. Another twenty plants of each species were selected randomly and harvested within the middle region of each plot. The number, size (length) and dry weight of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> seeds were measured. Sixty days later, germination rates of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> seeds from each plot were tested in the laboratory.
