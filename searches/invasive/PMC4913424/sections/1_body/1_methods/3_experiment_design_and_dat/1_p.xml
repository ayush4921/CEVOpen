<p>The experiments were conducted during the May, 2014-October, 2015 growing season within maize and sweet potato intercropping land in the vicinity of Zhangfeng Town, Longchuan County, utilizing a de Wit replacement series method [

 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> plants (including roots) were collected from a 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> population located in a nearby forest margin and whole sweet potato plants were collected from farmland, respectively. To ensure relative uniformity among the experimental stock, one-node segments (fresh weight 3.0–3.5 g, 7–8 cm pieces) were taken from central stem portions of relatively young plants of similar size from both species. The segments were placed in Hoagland’s solution [

 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> plants were utilized (3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 0:4) while maintaining a constant planting density of 20 plants m
 <sup>−2</sup> (0.25 × 0.20 m spacing). All plots were arranged in a complete randomized design with 4 replicates utilizing 25 m
 <sup>2</sup> plots (5 × 5 m). All sweet potato and 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> plants were distributed evenly within the plot. During the experiment, the two species exhibited prostrate growth. The plots were not weeded and no fertilizers were used.
