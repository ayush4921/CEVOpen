<p>During the spring, summer and fall of 2015 (March–October), four small quadrats (1 × 1 m) were selected randomly and marked in each plot. Seedlings were identified as either produced from germinating seeds (sexual) or vegetative growth (asexual). The number of new sexual and asexual 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> seedlings was monitored in each quadrat monthly. We did not remove the seedlings that were counted but rather kept track of the total that emerged through the season, month by month. Seedling mortality was also recorded for the 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> that emerged.
