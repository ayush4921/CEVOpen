 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] were calculated in each plot with the following parameters: (1) Reproductive allocation (g·g
 <sup>−1</sup>) = inflorescence biomass/total biomass of each plant, (2) Reproductive investment (g·g
 <sup>−1</sup>) = flower biomass/total biomass of each plant, (3) Reproductive index (g·g
 <sup>−1</sup>) = flower biomass/inflorescence biomass of each plant, (4) Reproductive ratio (flower·mg
 <sup>−1</sup>) = flower number/inflorescence biomass of each plant and (5) Reproductive efficiency index (flower·mg
 <sup>−1</sup>) = flower number/total biomass of each plant.
