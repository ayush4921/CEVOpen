<p>Flowering phenology is affected by number, timing and duration of flowers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. These factors are not only constrained by genetics and phylogeny, but also affected by environmental conditions, such as sunlight, temperature, nutrients, and competition [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The present study found that flowering phenology of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> was significantly delayed, duration of flowering and fruiting was significantly reduced and duration of bud formation was markedly increased with increased sweet potato proportions.
