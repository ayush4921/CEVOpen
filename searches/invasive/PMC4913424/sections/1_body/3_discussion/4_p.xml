<p>Nutrient availability also influences reproductive output by 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic>, with fewer flowers, lower seed setting percentage, lower 1000-grain weight and shorter flowering duration observed in plants growing in nutrient-deficient soils with suboptimal fertility, but soils with an overabundance of nutrients (e.g., silt from ponds or dump sites) also resulted in fewer flowers and low seed set [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Meanwhile, plants growing in an open habitat had more flowers with longer flowering duration, and under shade the 1000-grain weight was shown to have a slight increase, but light that was too bright or too dim was not conducive to seed set [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Light was found to affect fruiting; for example, a photoperiod of 12 h/day resulted in 68.4 % of flowers producing fruit [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The present study found that the number, biomass, length, set rate, germination rate, and 1000-grain dry weight of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> seeds was significantly suppressed with decreasing proportions of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic>. This is because 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> plants covered by dense carpets of sweet potato received fewer pollinator visits and produced fewer seeds. Furthermore, sweet potato exhibited greater absorption of soil nutrients than 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]; the resulting lack of nutrients likely lead to reduced 1000-grain weight and germination rate of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> in the presence of sweet potato.
