<p>Our research showed that the biomass, flowering, seed and seedling characteristics of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> were reduced when grown in association with sweet potato. A previous study showed that plant height, branch, leaf, stem node, adventitious root, and biomass of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> were suppressed significantly by sweet potato competition [

 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> were also significantly suppressed with increasing proportions of sweet potato. Moreover, with decreasing number and biomass of inflorescences and flowers, the reproductive allocation, reproductive investment and reproductive index of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> were also significantly reduced. The net result of the presence of sweet potato was reduced reproductive potential of M
 <italic>. micrantha</italic> and like other invasive species, its reproductive ability, including flowering characteristics, seed dispersal and seed germination parameters, is associated with its invasiveness [
