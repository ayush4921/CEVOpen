<p>The potential for high levels of sexual and/or vegetative reproduction by 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> is formidable [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It has transient soil seed bank and persistent soil seed bank, and some seeds would germinate given ideal germination conditions such as season, temperature, moisture; otherwise the seeds would remain dormant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Large numbers of seeds of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> were concentrated primarily in the 0–5 cm soil layer, which contained 98 % of the total seeds present in the soil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Vegetative propagation of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> from stem fragments that root easily at the nodes and from vegetative ramets arising from rosettes can be considered at least as important as reproduction by seeds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The seedling is the most vulnerable stage in the life history of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> and seedlings suffer a high level of mortality under natural conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. The present study found that with proportional increases in sweet potato, both sexual and asexual seedling populations of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> were significantly suppressed, corresponding to increased mortality with increasing levels of sweet potato competition. Thus, the best time to control 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> is during the seedling period and control measures should be comprehensive involving both herbicides and appropriate cultural techniques [
