<p>Intentional selection is not the only way in which agricultural operations facilitate rapid evolution in weedy species. Rapid evolution of invasive plants has, in some cases, been the consequence of attempts at mechanical and chemical control in agroecosystems (e.g. herbicide resistance in 
 <italic>Amaranthus palmeri</italic>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">Salas 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2016
 </xref>). Some are also exemplars of the role of management in driving local adaptation (

 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Gorton 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2018
 </xref>). Weedy and invasive plants (i.e. those that exhibit rapid rates of colonization, establishment and spread) have proven to be excellent models for studying adaptation to climate and competition (

  <italic>et al</italic>. 2016
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). This is, in part, due to the need for considering multiple drivers when studying invasions (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2013
 </xref>). Abiotic stresses (e.g. climate, drought and nutrient stress) are especially pertinent to invasion biology, where release from biotic and abiotic stressors is fundamental to many invasion hypotheses (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2013
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr">Turner 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2014
 </xref>). However, little is known about this trend’s extension to subsidies—whether elevated nutrient and moisture levels can drive rapid change in phenotypic responses to different climates. We postulate that this may be the case, given other examples in agricultural systems where irrigation performed as a microclimate creator (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2008
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Cavero 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2009
 </xref>). Here we test whether populations of the invasive Johnsongrass (
 <italic>Sorghum halepense</italic>, (L.) Pers. Poaceae) have adapted different stress responses based on their ambient and land use-impacted environments. In this way, we begin to examine whether anthropogenic differences in resource availability are linked with known ecotypes of an invader differing in their response to climatic and edaphic stressors.
