<p>Given the observed phenotypic differences in Johnsongrass from agricultural and non-agricultural populations and associated population genetic differences (

 </xref>), our objective was to test whether ecotypic origin (i.e. agricultural vs. non-agricultural) and environmental selection pressures would predict biomass accumulation and allocation in a common greenhouse experiment during seedling establishment—the most critical stage in population establishment and invasion (

Specifically, we were interested in the following questions: (i) Do Johnsongrass home climate and soil fertility drive differences in drought and nutrient stress tolerance? and (ii) Do Johnsongrass ecotypes vary in their drought and nutrient stress tolerance? Results of this study will be useful in elucidating relative degrees of local adaptation to climatic and habitat types across a large and expanding introduced range of this widespread and advancing invader. More broadly, it would be an uncommon head-to-head comparison of different drivers of local adaptation, while most studies focus on a single driver (e.g. climate, elevation, etc.), possibly addressing important interactive effects on invasive species range expansion.
