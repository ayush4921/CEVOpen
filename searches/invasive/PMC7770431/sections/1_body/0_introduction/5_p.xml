<p>Across its vast introduced range, Johnsongrass exhibits dramatic genetic and phenotypic variation (

 <xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">Rajakaruna 2018</xref>). Such effects have been observed in a range of invasive plants occupying broad novel ranges (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2018
 </xref>). The findings of differential response based on ecotype identity (i.e. agricultural and non-agricultural) alone are important to the larger question of whether the species is predisposed to generalist adaptability or specialization (
