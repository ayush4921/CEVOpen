<p>Local adaptation is the result of spatially heterogeneous selection pressures that give rise to populations with traits not universally present across environmental gradients (
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Kawecki and Ebert 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Leimu and Fischer 2008</xref>). Given enough magnitude and duration of such selection, a single species can yield multiple ecotypes that are distinguishable by traits linked with their geographic origin (
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Leimu and Fischer 2008</xref>). In some plants, intraspecific trait divergence has been shown to correlate with microclimate (
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Carvajal 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2017
 </xref>), human land use (
 <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Malíková 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2016
 </xref>) or biotic interactions like herbivory (
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Garrido 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2012
 </xref>). Traits linked to divergent ecotypes can include biomass production (
 <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">Matesanz 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2012
 </xref>), phenology (
 <xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">Sakaguchi 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2019
 </xref>), fitness (
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Armbruster 2014</xref>), cold-hardiness (
 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Lowry 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2014
 </xref>) and pollinator relations (
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Gervasi and Schiestl 2017</xref>). Rapid evolution, local adaptation and ecotypic divergence can readily be seen in invasive plant species which experience a broad spectrum of, often novel, selection pressures across vast ranges (
 <xref rid="CIT0080" ref-type="bibr">Whitney and Gabler 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Oduor 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2016
 </xref>). In fact, rapid adaptation and ‘de-domestication’ are often seen in feral crop species and manifest across a variety of their traits. A widely studied system exemplifying this is weedy rice (
 <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> f. 
 <italic>spontanea</italic>), in which 
 <xref rid="CIT0083" ref-type="bibr">Xia 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2011)
 </xref> found evidence for a change in germination niche adapted to novel ruderal habitats, rather than a reversion to a pre-cultivation phenotype.
