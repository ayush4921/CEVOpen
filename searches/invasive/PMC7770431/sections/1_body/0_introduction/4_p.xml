<p>Johnsongrass is a perennial grass that is native to parts of the Middle East and is currently a widespread invader in both agricultural and non-agricultural systems worldwide (
 <xref rid="CIT0076" ref-type="bibr">Warwick and Black 1983</xref>). The early introductions of Johnsongrass into North America—in South Carolina in the 1820s and later in Arizona—were into agricultural landscapes as a forage crop (
 <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">McWhorter 1971</xref>), though it quickly became weedy and was abandoned as a crop. The early invasion syndrome was observed in agroecosystems, which frequently led to forced abandonment of lands where mechanical removal of Johnsongrass failed (
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Ball 1902</xref>). Johnsongrass populations are mostly found in the southern half of the contiguous USA, with relatively few pioneer populations in the Northeast, Upper Midwest and Pacific Northwest. Over the course of its nearly 200-year residence in the USA, Johnsongrass has more recently become predominantly an invader of roadside, waste and other non-agricultural spaces (
