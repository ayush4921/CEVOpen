<p>We found evidence for local adaptation in Johnsongrass to home habitat parameters (MAT, MAP and SOC) as well as differential ecotypic adaptation. Responses to home habitat and ecotype identity interacted with experimentally applied drought and nutrient stresses. Mean annual temperature was the only home habitat variable found to impact seedling performance (specifically root allocation) on its own, while MAP, SOC and ecotype identity had interactive effects on plant response. Given earlier studies that find Johnsongrass ecotypic differences in competition (

 </xref>), stress response adaptation for competitive advantage (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2017
 </xref>), as well as abundant intraspecific variation globally (
 <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">McWhorter 1971</xref>), our findings of further local adaptation in various seedling traits provide additional evidence for how this species has become so widespread across a large and diverse geographic area. We can now interpret evidence of ecotypic differences in stress response while controlling for other abiotic habitat qualities. Our results suggest that the two Johnsongrass ecotypes, agricultural and non-agricultural, may have differently adapted to nutrient limitation. Our approach in sampling populations of both agricultural and non-agricultural origins along extensive MAP, MAT and SOC gradients has given us new evidence of Johnsongrass adaptation associated specifically with human land uses. The fact that this effect was mediated by nutrient availability brings us closer to testing its mechanisms in the future. Commonly suggested physiological mechanisms for nutrient stress tolerance in other species include tissue life maximization (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2010
 </xref>). The latter, with regard to N fixation, has been found in some non-agricultural Johnsongrass populations (
