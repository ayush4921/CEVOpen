<p>Population differences in stress response at the seedling stages suggest advantages for producing founder populations in new locations. The capacity for these stress adaptations in invasive plants has often been associated with greater spread and persistence (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2019
 </xref>). We see that no life stage is alone responsible for invasion success, but rather a suite of mechanisms interacts over time to boost the invader’s fitness. Studying seedlings is advantageous for discerning the roles of abiotic stresses to which plants later become less vulnerable, while limiting experiments to this stage may inhibit our ability to understand the invader’s competitive ability, which is dynamic over time. As our interests here were limited to the former, the seedling experiment was most appropriate.
