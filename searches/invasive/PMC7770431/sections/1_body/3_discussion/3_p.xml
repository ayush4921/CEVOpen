<p>Root:shoot biomass ratio is an indicator of plant health, particularly in its extreme values. Ratios approaching zero are indicative of very low root allocation, which signals overall poor health (

 <xref rid="CIT0082" ref-type="bibr">Wilson 1988</xref>). Ratios close to 1 (not an absolute rule across species) indicate overall good health. Ratios substantially higher than 1 indicate intensified root allocation, which is a proxy for drought stress response in a vast number of species (

  <italic>et al.</italic>’s (2017)
 </xref> meta-analysis found that the root allocation response of perennial herbs, of which Johnsongrass is one, is less drought-sensitive than annual herbs, but more sensitive than that of woody plants. This finding suggests that a plant’s drought sensitivity may be directly related to its degree of investment in perenniating tissues. Specifically, highest sensitivity was linked with no such investment (annuals) and lowest sensitivity corresponded to maximal investment (woody plants), while intermediate drought sensitivity was associated with perennial herbaceous plants. Johnsongrass’s rhizomes are critical in its evasion of and resilience to cold stress (

 </xref>;

 </xref>) and could be similarly linked with drought response. However, this could not have been the cause of seedling drought tolerance in our study due to negligible rhizome production at this early life stage. This suggests that a physiological mechanism—perhaps even one inherited from its ancestor
