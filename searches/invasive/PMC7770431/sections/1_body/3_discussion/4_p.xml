<p>The positive response of root:shoot ratio to Johnsongrass home MAT is potentially linked to the metabolic physiology of Johnsongrass and, indirectly, its success as an invader. Two global meta-analyses—one of 7763 terrestrial ecosystems (
 <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">Qi 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2019
 </xref>) and another of &gt;6200 forests (
 <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">Reich 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2014
 </xref>)—found that plants growing in colder climates have a higher root:shoot ratio. However, research on 
 <italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic> (
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Clark and Reinhard 1991</xref>) and 
 <italic>Cleistogenes</italic> spp. (
 <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Luo 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2013
 </xref>), both C4 grasses like Johnsongrass, shows root:shoot ratio increasing with higher MAT. To explain this, 
 <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Luo 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)
 </xref> cite general C-allocation advantages of C4 over C3 plants under high CO
 <sub>2</sub> and high temperature/aridity conditions (
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Ehleringer 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 1997
 </xref>). While our study only examined intraspecific variation in a C4 grass, rather than comparing it with C3 species, it stands to reason that the positive relationship between MAT and Johnsongrass root allocation was indicative of adaptation to hotter and drier home habitats. This finding poses the question of whether Johnsongrass’s heightened root allocation impacts its competitive—and therefore invasive—ability. Johnsongrass is known to compete with crops (e.g. maize) largely below-ground (
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Acciaresi and Guiamet 2010</xref>), which supports the idea that its higher C4-facilitated performance in hotter habitats may translate into a competitive advantage. However, its below-ground competitive effect is difficult to test empirically in complex plant communities (
