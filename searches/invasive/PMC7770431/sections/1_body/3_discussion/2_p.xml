<p>There are numerous examples of drought tolerance advantages among invasive plants (e.g.

 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0075" ref-type="bibr">Vetter

 </xref>) and among C4 invaders in particular (

 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Fahey 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2018
 </xref>). Drought is one of many stresses which is thought to select for invasive species and communities of invaders over native counterparts (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2012
 </xref>). Stochastic stress tolerance in invasive plants is also seen as a key element of their r-selection strategy (
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Berger and Ludwig 2014</xref>). By parsing seedling root and shoot biomass, we were able to examine Johnsongrass seedling drought response in relation to its ecotype identity and home habitat conditions.
