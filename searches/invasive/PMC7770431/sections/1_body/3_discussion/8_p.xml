<p>Overall, we found support for differences in drought stress based on home habitat properties—namely, water availability (MAP) and soil fertility (SOC). We did not find evidence for differences in nutrient stress response based on home habitat properties MAT, MAP or SOC. We found ecotype identity to moderate performance differences based on SOC in home habitat; however, we found no direct relationships between ecotype and MAT, MAP, or the irrigation and/or fertilization treatments. We can use these interpretations to reflect more broadly on long-term trajectories of biological invasions. Human landscape management across fine and coarse scales can have an enormous impact on the distribution (

 </xref>). With land-use change and accompanying changes in management regimes in disturbed ecosystems selecting for adaptable lineages, we expect to see similar patterns across taxa. Numerous studies have found nutrient pollution (

 </xref>) and urban heat island effect (

In particular, landscape novelty and heterogeneity in urbanized areas present great challenges to our understanding of invader adaptation and potential management (
