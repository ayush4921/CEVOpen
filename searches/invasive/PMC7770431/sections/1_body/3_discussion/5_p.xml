<p>Populations from arid climates responded most strongly to the difference in water availability by allocating significantly more to roots under drought conditions. Compared to mesic home habitat populations, which showed no change in root allocation during drought, arid origin populations showed an important plastic response. This suggests that frequent drought stress may have selected for this plastic response in Johnsongrass populations from arid regions, but not their counterparts from places where drought is rare. Studies on other C4 grasses suggest that variation in drought response adaptations may be indicative of the type or duration of drought associated with selection in home habitats. For example, 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Cardoso 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2015)
 </xref> compared drought response in two C4 grasses and found a suite of responses, including plastic increase in root:shoot ratio to be associated with the species that had adapted to intermittent drought, rather than prolonged drought. From the perspective of deep evolutionary time,

  <italic>et al.</italic> (2018)
 </xref> assert that water limitation (given high atmospheric CO

 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Ehleringer 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 1997
 </xref>). In a Texas grassland community context, 
 <xref rid="CIT0081" ref-type="bibr">Wilsey and Polley (2006)</xref> found both C3 and C4 grasses (Johnsongrass not among them) to respond plastically to drought; however, native grasses had a greater increase in root:shoot ratio than invaders. 
 <xref rid="CIT0069" ref-type="bibr">Schwinning 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2017)
 </xref>—while unable to compare below-ground allocation—also found that Johnsongrass seedlings’ advantage over native competitors was significant above-ground. Thus, given contextual evidence to date, root:shoot plasticity in Johnsongrass from arid, but not mesic, regions is more likely an adaptation linked with general performance in a stressful growing environment rather than a competitive advantage.
