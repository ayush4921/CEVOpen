<p>Leaf chlorophyll content varied between ecotypes as a function of SOC in their home habitat (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Non-agricultural populations from habitats across SOC levels had nearly uniform chlorophyll production. Agricultural populations, however, produced significantly more chlorophyll in populations from home habitats of high SOC. Among populations from the most SOC-poor origins of the USA, non-agricultural populations contained as much as 50 mg m
 <sup>−2</sup> more chlorophyll than agricultural populations. Among populations whose home habitats had SOC of &gt;17 g kg
 <sup>−1</sup>, agricultural populations overtook non-agricultural counterparts in chlorophyll production.
