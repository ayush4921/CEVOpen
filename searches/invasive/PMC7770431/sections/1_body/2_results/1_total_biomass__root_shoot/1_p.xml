<p>The irrigation and fertilization treatments had strong positive interactive effects on total biomass as well as chlorophyll content (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Fertilization resulted in a 59 % increase in biomass among irrigated individuals (0.96–2.35 g), but only a 44 % increase among unirrigated individuals (0.61–1.1 g) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Leaf chlorophyll content increased by only 9 % due to fertilization among irrigated plants (306–338 mg m
 <sup>−2</sup>), while fertilization of unirrigated plants yielded a 51 % increase in leaf chlorophyll content (122–249 mg m
 <sup>−2</sup>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Mean root:shoot of unirrigated populations (0.7) was significantly higher than that of irrigated populations (0.5) (
