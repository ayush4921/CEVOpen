<p>Johnsongrass population differences in root:shoot ratio were affected by home climate, while chlorophyll content differences responded to SOC. We observed a mild, yet significant, positive relationship between home habitat MAT and Johnsongrass root:shoot biomass ratio across populations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). An increase in root:shoot ratio from 0.6 to 0.78 was associated with an increase in home MAT from 11 to 22 Â°C, which did not vary between ecotypes.
