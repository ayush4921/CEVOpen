<p>While Johnsongrass home habitat SOC had a slightly negative effect on chlorophyll content of irrigated plants, it had a positive effect on chlorophyll content in unirrigated plants (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Thus, the irrigation treatment was responsible for a 67 % greater difference in chlorophyll content between samples from SOC-poor habitats (180 mg m
 <sup>−2</sup>, on average) than on those from SOC-rich habitats (120 mg m
 <sup>−2</sup>, on average).
