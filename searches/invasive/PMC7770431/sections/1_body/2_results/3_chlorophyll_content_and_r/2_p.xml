<p>Root:shoot ratio response of irrigated and unirrigated plants differed based on home habitat MAP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). The root:shoot ratio of Johnsongrass grown with non-limiting soil moisture increased with higher MAP, while we observed a decreasing root:shoot ratio in droughted Johnsongrass as MAP increased (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0147). In other words, drought produced no significant difference in root:shoot biomass ratio (R:S) among plants from the highest precipitation home habitats, while leading to a significant increase (from an average of 0.49 to 0.78) in R:S among plants from the most arid origins.
