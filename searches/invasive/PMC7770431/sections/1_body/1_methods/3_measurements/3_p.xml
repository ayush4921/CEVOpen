<p>Chlorophyll fluorescence ratio is the quotient in this equation, or ‘the ratio of fluorescence or fluorescence emission at 735 nm/700 nm’. The latter two were measured using CCM-300 Chlorophyll Content Meter (OPTI-SCIENCES, Hudson, NH, USA). The experiment continued until the most vigorous plants filled their pots with roots, which occurred 28 days after treatment application. At the end of the experiment, presence of rhizome(s) was recorded, and biomass was harvested separately for below-ground and above-ground portions and dried at 75 °C for 7 days.</p>
