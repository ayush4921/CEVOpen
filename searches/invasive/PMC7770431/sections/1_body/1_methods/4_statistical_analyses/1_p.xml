<p>To describe climate at the place of origin of each population (hereafter ‘home climate’), we used MAP and mean annual temperature (MAT) (
 <xref rid="CIT0087" ref-type="bibr">PRISM Climate Group 2004</xref>), as well as the soil organic carbon content (SOC) (
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Hengl 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2014
 </xref>) as a descriptor of habitat nutrient availability. We chose SOC to represent soil fertility (or nutrient availability) based on findings of strong positive relationships between SOC and N/P/K availability in agroecosystems (
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Cheng 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2016
 </xref>). Following analysis of response variable correlation, we used three independent response variables: total biomass, CFR and root-to-shoot biomass ratio. The total biomass and root:shoot variables were log
 <sub>10</sub>-transformed to meet assumptions of the linear model. Each response variable was analysed in a mixed effects linear model with block as a random effect and height-at-transplant, MAP, MAT and SOC as fixed effects, and ecotype (agricultural vs. non-agricultural), fertilization and irrigation as fixed effects, as well as all possible second-order interactions. We then performed backwards model selection, removing non-significant predictors to minimize corrected Akaike Information Criterion. The main effects of block, initial height, irrigation treatment and fertilization treatment were kept in all models. All statistical analyses were performed using JMP Pro, Version 15 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
