<p>To release seeds from dormancy, we treated them with commercial strength sodium hypochlorite (Clorox Regular-Bleach, The Clorox Company, Oakland, CA, USA) for 4 h followed by a 1-h water rinse (

Upon radicle emergence, seeds were transferred to 6.4-cm diameter, 656-mL tree pots (Stuewe &amp; Sons, Inc., Tangent, OR, USA) filled with a 2:1 mixture of washed sand to sifted mineral soil collected locally and allowed to establish for 8 days. Individuals from each population were then randomly assigned to one of four treatments: + fertilizer/+ irrigation; + fertilizer/− irrigation; − fertilizer/+ irrigation; and − fertilizer/− irrigation. Pots were arranged in a randomized complete block design with five replicates, with each block representing a greenhouse bench. Irrigation was applied as 10 mL of water daily, keeping the soil near field capacity. Fertilizer (PowerPak 20-20-20, Southern Agricultural Insecticides Inc., Hendersonville, NC, USA) was applied once at time of transplant as a solute in 10 mL of water at a rate of 4 mL L
 <sup>−1</sup>, which matches the recommended product rate for spray and drench applications. Plants not receiving fertilizer were given 10 mL of water at time of transplant. Due to presumed nutrient availability in the mineral soil which made up one-third of our growing media, the ‘− fertilizer’ treatment more likely created a nutrient limitation than a deficiency. The drought treatments (− irrigation) were administered by reducing irrigation to 5 mL per day on day 1 of treatment, and 0 mL irrigation after 7 days of treatment.
