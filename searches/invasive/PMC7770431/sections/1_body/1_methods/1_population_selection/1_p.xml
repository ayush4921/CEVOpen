<p>We drew from our collection of &gt;200 Johnsongrass populations representing the full geographic and climatic variation of its US range. For this study, we chose from 30 populations that spanned this range, and had been grown for a generation in a common garden to reduce maternal effects, focusing on full representation of the range of mean precipitation as we are examining drought tolerance. We split the set of 30 populations into those collected from agricultural (8) and non-agricultural (22) sites. All populations were plotted in geographic space using ArcMap 10.5.1 (ArcGIS Desktop: Release 10. Redlands, CA: Environmental Systems Research Institute.) overlaid with a 30-year mean annual precipitation (MAP) raster data obtained from PRISM Climate Group, Oregon State University (

The MAP values for the non-agricultural populations ranged from 199 to 1430 mm, while MAP for the agricultural populations ranged from 190 to 1481 mm. These were categorized into six ‘precipitation bands’ of equal range: (1) 190–406 mm, (2) 406–621 mm, (3) 621–836 mm, (4) 836–1051 mm, (5) 1051–1266 mm and (6) 1266–1481 mm. We had viable seed of agricultural and non-agricultural populations in bands 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6. Thus, we arrived at five agricultural populations and five non-agricultural populations which represent the breadth of the precipitation spectrum on which Johnsongrass occurs in the USA (see
