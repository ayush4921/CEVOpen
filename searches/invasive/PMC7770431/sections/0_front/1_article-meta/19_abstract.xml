 <p>Johnsongrass, a perennial invader on six continents, is established in both agricultural and non-agricultural habitats across the USA. By testing drought and nutrient stress response of seedlings from populations across the US range, we found that precipitation and soil fertility from the site of population origin mediated drought adaptation, while the latter also impacted differential chlorophyll content of agricultural and non-agricultural ecotypes. Our findings suggest simultaneous rapid adaptation to climate, soil fertility and land use in the establishment of this invasive species. Notably, the non-agricultural ecotype, which emerged after intensive management in cropland, showed greater adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
