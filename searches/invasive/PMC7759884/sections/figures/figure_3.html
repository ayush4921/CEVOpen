 <caption> GC content and average sequencing depth distribution of in vivo ( a) and in vitro ( b) M. cordata after decontamination. The stray regions at high GC content and low depth were both shrunk dramatically compared to Figure 2. ( a) Due to the relatively low sequencing depth of in vivo plant, the high-density region is more concentrated. However, there remains a small stray region at the low depth and high GC content. ( b) Due to the relatively high sequencing depth of in vitro plantlets, there are two distinct high-density regions around 76× and 38×, which might be the homologous and heterologous sequences in the genome. </caption>
