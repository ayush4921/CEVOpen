  <p>GC content and average sequencing depth distribution of in vivo (
   <bold>a</bold>) and in vitro (
   <bold>b</bold>) 
   <italic>M. cordata</italic> after decontamination. The stray regions at high GC content and low depth were both shrunk dramatically compared to 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01665-f002">Figure 2</xref>. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Due to the relatively low sequencing depth of in vivo plant, the high-density region is more concentrated. However, there remains a small stray region at the low depth and high GC content. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Due to the relatively high sequencing depth of in vitro plantlets, there are two distinct high-density regions around 76× and 38×, which might be the homologous and heterologous sequences in the genome.
