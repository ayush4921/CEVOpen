  <p>Micropropagation of 
   <italic>M. cordata</italic>. (
   <bold>a</bold>) A greenhouse-grown 
   <italic>M. cordata</italic> and the juvenile shoots (in the circle) were collected as explant donors. (
   <bold>b</bold>) On the 6th day, three explants were colonized by bacteria and two explants died in one antibiotic-free medium. (
   <bold>c</bold>) On the 6th day, two explants were colonized by fungi and two explants were potentially aseptic in one TIM-treated medium. (
   <bold>d</bold>) The plantlet had sprouted after 6 weeks of cultivation with CTX. (
   <bold>e</bold>) The plantlet had sprouted after 6 weeks of cultivation with TIM. (
   <bold>f</bold>) After 8 weeks of cultivation on 1/2 MS media with CTX, the plantlet grew sparse roots with relatively small leaves. (
   <bold>g</bold>) After 8 weeks of cultivation on 1/2 MS media with TIM, the plantlet grew lush roots with relatively large leaves. (
   <bold>h</bold>) The robust plantlets were transferred to plastic pots containing soil and sand (1:1) mixture and were able to establish ex vitro after 4 weeks of cultivation. Abbreviation: CTX, cefotaxime; TIM, timentin; MS, Murashige and Skoog.
