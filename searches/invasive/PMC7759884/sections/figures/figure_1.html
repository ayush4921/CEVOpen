 <caption> Micropropagation of M. cordata. ( a) A greenhouse-grown M. cordata and the juvenile shoots (in the circle) were collected as explant donors. ( b) On the 6th day, three explants were colonized by bacteria and two explants died in one antibiotic-free medium. ( c) On the 6th day, two explants were colonized by fungi and two explants were potentially aseptic in one TIM-treated medium. ( d) The plantlet had sprouted after 6 weeks of cultivation with CTX. ( e) The plantlet had sprouted after 6 weeks of cultivation with TIM. ( f) After 8 weeks of cultivation on 1/2 MS media with CTX, the plantlet grew sparse roots with relatively small leaves. ( g) After 8 weeks of cultivation on 1/2 MS media with TIM, the plantlet grew lush roots with relatively large leaves. ( h) The robust plantlets were transferred to plastic pots containing soil and sand (1:1) mixture and were able to establish ex vitro after 4 weeks of cultivation. Abbreviation: CTX, cefotaxime; TIM, timentin; MS, Murashige and Skoog. </caption>
