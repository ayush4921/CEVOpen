 <caption> GC content and average sequencing depth distribution of in vivo ( a) and in vitro ( b) M. cordata. The x-axis represents the GC content of contigs while the y-axis represents their average depth. Each dot represents an individual contig. The red region indicates high-density portions of the contigs. The extracted regions are indicated by the dashed rectangle. The distribution of contig depth is posited on the right while the distribution of GC content is on the top. </caption>
