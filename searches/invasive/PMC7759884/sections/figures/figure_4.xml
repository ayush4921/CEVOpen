  <p>Distribution of 17-mer depth and frequency of in vivo (red line) and in vitro (blue line) 
   <italic>M. cordata</italic>. The highest cut-off frequency is at 1% and the maximum cut-off depth is at 250Ã—. Arrows indicate the half depth, the depth, and the double depth of the main peak, respectively. The main peak represents the overall sequencing depth of the genome. The second-highest peak around the double depth of the main peak represents repetitive sequences. The nonobvious peak at the half depth of the main peak represents the heterozygous peak. The 17-mer distribution suggests that the genome of 
   <italic>M. cordata</italic> is highly repetitive.
