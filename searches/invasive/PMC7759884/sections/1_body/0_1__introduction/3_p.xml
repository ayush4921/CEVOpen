<p>Plants live together with covert endophytes extensively, although many plant genomes have been sequenced and assembled [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, the host DNA may be contaminated with foreign DNA during extraction. The contaminant DNA, if not eliminated, will be sequenced and assembled along with the host DNA [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. For example, in the genome of 
 <italic>Saccharina japonica</italic> and the domesticated olive, up to 1.5% and 1.3% scaffolds were identified as contaminants, respectively, which were missed in the published genome [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The most common method to filter contaminants in sequencing is to trim the nontarget sequences in silico based on nucleotide similarity [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], which however risks eliminating sequences from the target organism because of extensive horizontal gene transfer between plant and microbes [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In this context, obtaining the aseptic sample represents a fundamental solution for contamination issues. There have been reports that the in vitro aseptic plantlets were used for whole-genome sequencing, such as algae 
 <italic>Spirogloea muscicola</italic>, 
 <italic>Mesotaenium endlicherianum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and poppy family 
 <italic>Macleaya cordata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> spp., several endophytes are documented, which probably poses the biggest challenge for the axenic culture. Recently, nine fungal endophytes have been isolated from the leaves, twigs, and roots of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The bacterial endophytes have been identified in 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> as well [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Additionally, more than 90% of the plantlets contaminated by endophytic bacteria or fungi have been found in micropropagation of 
 <italic>Mikania glomerate</italic> even after surface disinfection [
 <xref rid="B26-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We have also encountered microbial growth during the in vitro culture of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic>. Further, antibiotics were incorporated into culture media to suppress bacterial growth. Specifically, the bacterial inhibitory effect of two types of Î²-lactam antibiotics, the widely used cefotaxime (CTX) and the novel timentin (TIM) [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], were assessed on the micropropagation of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> in the present study. Since micropropagation enables to efficiently generate genetically faithful clones via tissue culture [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], it is reasonable to apply the method to obtain multiple identical plantlets for genome sequencing.
