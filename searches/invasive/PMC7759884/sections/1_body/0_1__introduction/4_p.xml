<p>Plant genomes are typically repetitive, which are too complicated to de novo assemble by Illumina short-read sequencing [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In this respect, long-read sequencing may exceed the repetitive region in genomes and successfully assemble the contiguous genome [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Nevertheless, due to the costly nature of long-read sequencing, it is a convention to perform short-read sequencing in advance. Genome survey sequencing provides a cost-effective strategy to estimate genome size, heterozygosity, and repetitive rate based on short-read data [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. More importantly, it can also be applied to evaluate the simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers at the genome level. In this work, a micropropagation protocol for producing visibly aseptic 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> has been developed, and the genome of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> has been characterized for the first time. It will help comprehensively for scheming the subsequent long-read sequencing of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> genome.
