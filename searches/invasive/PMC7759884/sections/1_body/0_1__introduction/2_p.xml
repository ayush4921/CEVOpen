 <italic>Mikania micrantha</italic>, also known as “mile-a-minute” weed, is native to tropical America and has spread through Asia and the South Pacific [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The creeping and climbing habits enable 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> to smother the host plants by penetrating crowns and blocking sunlight [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. 
 <italic>Mikania micrantha</italic>, as one of the top 100 worst invasive species, has caused severe damage to natural ecosystems and substantial economic losses [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. On the contrary, 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> grows at a relatively slow rate without ecological harm [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> and 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> are a perfect couple for comparative study which can provide novel insights into the successful establishment of introduced species [
 <xref rid="B10-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Previous comparative studies of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> and 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> mainly focus on physiological traits [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], chloroplast genome [
 <xref rid="B11-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and transcriptome [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], whereas the genomic level analysis lacks. The genome of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> reveals that high photosynthetic efficiency and capability contribute to the successful invasion [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Comparative genomics, rather than independent analysis, thus can determine the root causes of functional trait divergence [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, the genomic resources of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> are lagging far behind 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic>. The high-quality genome of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> is urgently necessary for the forthcoming comparative genomics.
