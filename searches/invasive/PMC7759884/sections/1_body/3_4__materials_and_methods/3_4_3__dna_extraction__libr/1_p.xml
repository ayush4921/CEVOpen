<p>The fresh leaves of in vivo mother plant and in vitro plantlets were used for genome survey sequencing, respectively. Briefly, genomic DNA was isolated using the CTAB (Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide) method [
 <xref rid="B65-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. DNA purity and integrity were monitored on 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and DNA concentration was measured using Qubit DNA Assay Kit in Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The genomic DNA of each sample was randomly sheared into short fragments of around 350 bp by M220 Covaris ultrasonicator (Covaris, Woburn, MA, USA). The fragments were subjected to library construction using the Truseq Nano DNA HT Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The paired-end libraries were sequenced using the Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with read length of 2 Ã— 150 bp by Novogene Co., Ltd. Two sets of raw sequencing reads are available in the Short Read Archive (SRA) database under the accession number of SRR12532532 (the in vitro grown plantlet) and SRR12532533 (the in vivo mother plant).
