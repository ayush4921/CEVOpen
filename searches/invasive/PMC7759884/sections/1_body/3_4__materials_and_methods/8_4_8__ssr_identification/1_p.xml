 <xref rid="B71-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The minimum number of repeats was set to 10, 6, 5, 5, 5, and 5 for mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexanucleotides, respectively. The statistics of SSR motifs were analyzed by Excel 2019 and plotted using the Python matplotlib package and Tableau.
