<p>Based on the GC depth distribution, the contigs in the distinct stray regions were extracted using a custom-made Perl script. The contigs from stray regions were blasted (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) against the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) NT (Nucleotide collection) database with E-value = 1e âˆ’ 5. The contigs that hit the sequences of microbes were regarded as the contaminating contigs and were subsequently used to build a local contaminant database. After that, the raw reads as queries were blasted against the contaminant database. The raw reads hit, regarded as contaminants, were filtered out. Consequently, the decontaminated raw reads were generated. After trimming the decontaminated raw reads with the same standard as above, the decontaminated clean reads were obtained.</p>
