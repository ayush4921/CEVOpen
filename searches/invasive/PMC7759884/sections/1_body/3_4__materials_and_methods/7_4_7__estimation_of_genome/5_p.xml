<p>Another small peak at the multiple depth of the main peak represents the repetitive sequences. The 17-mers with the depth 1.8 times higher than the depth of the main peak were regarded as repetitive sequences. The proportion of those 17-mers were predicted to be the repetitive rate in the genome.</p>
