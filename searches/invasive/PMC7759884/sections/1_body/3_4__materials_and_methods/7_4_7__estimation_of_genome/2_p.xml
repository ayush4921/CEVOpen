<p>Due to sequencing error, there were many low-frequency 17-mers. The proportion of 17-mers with depth = 1 was regarded as the error rate. The genome size was revised via the following formula:
 <disp-formula>Revised genome size = Genome size × (1 − Error rate)
  <label>(2)</label>
 </disp-formula>
