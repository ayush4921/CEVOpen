<p>Through Illumina sequencing, a total of 135.4 Gb and 176.5 Gb raw reads were obtained from the in vivo and in vitro culture of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> with 89.94% and 92.97% Q30 bases scores, respectively. After removing low-quality reads, 120.1 Gb (in vivo) and 154.3 Gb (in vitro) clean reads were generated. The GC content from the in vivo plant is 37.95%, which is higher than the 36.74% GC content from in vitro plantlets (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01665-f002">Figure 2</xref>, the GC content and sequencing depth distribution of the &gt;500 bp contigs were plotted, and the red regions represented the high-density portions of the contigs. For in vivo plant, most contigs were concentrated in 20−50% GC content and approximately 25−50× depth region. There were also several high-density stray regions in 20−80% GC content under 15× depth and in 60−100% GC content between 20−80× depth, which may be contributed by the microbial contaminant. For in vitro plantlets, there were three distinct high-density regions. The highest density occurred in the region of 20−50% GC content and around 50−80× depth. Of the same GC content but around 40× depth was another high-density region. The dense stray regions between 57−80% under 10× depth may be caused by the microbial contaminant. The stray regions of in vitro plantlets were shrunk remarkably compared to those of in vivo
