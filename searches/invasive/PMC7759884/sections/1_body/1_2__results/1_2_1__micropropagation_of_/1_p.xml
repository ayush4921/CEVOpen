<p>A total of 51 apical and axillary shoots of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> was collected as explant donor of in vitro culture (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01665-f001">Figure 1</xref>a). Of the antibiotic-free group served by 11 explants, 7 explants were colonized by bacteria while the others were killed by surface disinfection (

 <xref rid="plants-09-01665-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Fungi colonized 3 of the 20 explants in the CTX-treated group. By contrast, bacteria and fungi colonized four and one of the 20 explants, respectively, in the TIM-treated group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01665-f001">Figure 1</xref>c). Initially, five explants were cultured on each Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium. The contaminated explants were discarded once bacteria or fungi appeared, and the remaining explants in the medium were transferred to a fresh medium. In all instances, the microbial colonization became visible within 2 weeks. After 4 weeks of cultivation, four (CTX-treated) and five (TIM-treated) explants were nonviable and also discarded.
