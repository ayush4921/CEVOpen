 <sup>−1</sup> TIM generated well-rooted plantlets; hence, TIM was the only antibiotic used in the subsequent subculture. The axillary shoots of aseptic plantlets from two experimental groups were cut off and subcultured on 1/2 MS media supplemented with TIM. All the plantlets transferring from CTX-containing media to TIM enabled to root. After two rounds of large-scale propagation, more than 300 visibly aseptic plantlets were obtained (

Additionally, the leaves of a batch of aseptic plantlets were harvested for genome survey sequencing. Moreover, most of the ~100 plantlets in long-term maintenance (&gt;300 days) were still visibly aseptic though latent or exogenous microbes grew in a few cultures. Although our goal was to generate aseptic plantlets instead of to establish ex vitro plants, the plantlets were able to establish ex vitro after acclimatization (
