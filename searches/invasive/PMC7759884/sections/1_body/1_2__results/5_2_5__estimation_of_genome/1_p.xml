<p>The decontaminated clean reads were used for 17-mer frequency analysis for genome size estimation. The number of 17-mer was 97,798,286,149 (in vivo) and 137,835,582,212 (in vitro), respectively (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01665-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). The main peak of 17-mer frequency distribution was at 53× (in vivo) and 76× (in vitro) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01665-f004">Figure 4</xref>), which represented the overall sequencing depth of the genome. The second and third-highest peaks were separately located at around the double and half depth of the main peak. The estimated genome size was 1,845.25 Mb (in vivo) and 1812.83 Mb (in vitro), respectively. By removing the 17-mer at 1× depth, each size was revised to 1,816.81 Mb (in vivo) and 1801.99 Mb (in vitro). The heterozygosity was calculated as 0.64% (in vivo) and 0.50% (in vitro). The repetitive rate was estimated at 74.72% (in vivo) and 78.35% (in vitro). Overall, results of the 17-mer distribution indicated that the genome of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> is highly repetitive.
