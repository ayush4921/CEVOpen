<p>The &gt;100 bp contigs were further assembled into 1,443,212 (in vivo) and 1,526,309 (in vitro) scaffolds, with N50 of 3087 bp and 2570 bp, respectively (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01665-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The scaffold assembly consisted of 4.33% (in vivo) and 5.02% (in vitro) N bases. The longest contig and scaffold from in vivo plant unusually exceeded those from in vitro plantlets (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01665-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). There were 42 and 20 scaffolds from the in vivo plant, which were longer than the longest scaffold from in vitro plantlets, aligned with fungi and bacteria, respectively (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-09-01665">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). To measure the completeness of scaffold assembly, BUSCO analysis was performed showing that 76.08% of 255 core eukaryotic genes were completely identified in the scaffolds of in vitro plantlets, including 68.24% single-copy genes and 7.84% duplicated genes. Additionally, 15.29% and 8.63% were identified as fragmented and missing genes, respectively (see
