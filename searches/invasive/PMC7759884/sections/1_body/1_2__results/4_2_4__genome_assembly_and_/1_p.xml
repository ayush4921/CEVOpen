<p>The clean reads and GC content from in vivo plant were greatly decreased by 10.5 Gb and 1.01% after decontamination, respectively. By contrast, only 0.1 Gb clean reads from in vitro plantlets were filtered out, and GC content was slightly decreased by 0.02% (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01665-f003">Figure 3</xref>). However, there remained a small stray region at low depth with high GC content for in vivo plant, probably caused by the unfiltered microbes with high GC content. Due to the relatively high sequencing depth of in vitro plantlets, there were two distinct high-density regions around 76× and 38×, which might be derived from the homologous and heterologous sequences in the genome.
