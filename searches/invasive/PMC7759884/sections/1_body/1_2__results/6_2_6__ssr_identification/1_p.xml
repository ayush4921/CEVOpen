<p>The scaffolds from in vitro plantlets with a low level of contaminants were utilized for SSR identification to ensure higher reliability. A total of 289,831 SSRs, including 125,155 (43.1%) mono-, 113,695 (39.2%) di-, 38,804 (13.3%) tri-, 9509 (3.3%) tetra-, 1390 (0.48%) penta-, and 1278 (0.44%) hexanucleotide repeats, were identified in 149,441 scaffolds. The mononucleotide repeat was the most abundant type. The di- to hexanucleotide SSRs were grouped according to the repeat times of motifs (from 5â€“4 repeat times,

However, for trinucleotide SSR with 11 repeats, its number is larger than that of 10 repeats, which was attributed to a large proportion of AAT/ATT in the former. The 20 most frequent SSR types were present in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01665-f005">Figure 5</xref>b. The A/T repeat type was the most dominant, accounting for 41.2% of all SSRs, followed by AT/AT (25.8%). Several trinucleotides and tetranucleotide repeat types, such as AAT/ATT, ATC/ATG, and ACAT/ATGT, also made up a remarkable proportion.
