<p>Contigs in the stray regions were extracted to confirm their origin. The contigs in four regions from in vivo plant were extracted: 0−100% GC content at 0−14× depth, 0−60% GC content at 14−24× depth, 60−100% GC content at 20−35× depth, and 60−100% GC content at 40−80× depth. The contigs in 57−80% GC content at 0−10× depth from in vitro plantlets were extracted. The top five species distribution of contigs in stray regions was listed in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01665-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The contigs that hit microbes are far less from in vitro plantlets than those from in vivo plant. In the stray regions from in vivo plant, there were overwhelming contigs that hit 
 <italic>Fusarium fujikuroi</italic>, an endophytic fungus capable of causing various types of plant diseases [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The most dominant contigs in the high GC content region of both samples hit 
 <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> spp. which were known as the plant growth-promoting bacteria [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Of the stray region of 14−24× depth and 0−60% GC content from in vivo plant, contigs were aligned to plant sequences (the top five) followed by a few microbe ones (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-09-01665">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). This indicated that the stray region mainly consisted of the low-depth contigs of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic>.
