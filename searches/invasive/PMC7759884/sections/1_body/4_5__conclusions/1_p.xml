<p>This is the first report of the whole-genome sequencing of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic>. Based on 154.2 Gb (85Ã— coverage) of clean reads from in vitro plantlets, the genome size of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> is estimated to be 1.80 Gb with 0.50% heterozygosity and 78.35% repetitive rate. A total of 1.05 Gb scaffold was assembled, and 289,831 genomic SSRs were identified. The greenhouse-grown 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> severely involved microbial contamination, and therefore micropropagation was undertaken with the objectives of obtaining aseptic 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic>. Both CTX and TIM enable to suppress the growth of endophytic bacteria for the in vitro culture of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic>. Overall, treatment with TIM has performed better in cultivating the robust in vitro plantlets. Our protocol to generate aseptic plantlets by micropropagation and perform genome survey sequencing can be applied to other plants that are heavily contaminated by endophytes. Since the genome of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> is highly repetitive, we recommend using long-read sequencing for generating a contiguous genome. To avoid high levels of endophytes infection, the aseptic plantlets of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> can be used in future sequencing, which will save considerable sequencing resources as well as achieve a high-quality assembly.
