<p>The initial goal of this study was to characterize the genome of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> but was impeded by the endophytic microbes. Endophytes that are ubiquitous in field plants confer benefits to their hosts, such as promoting plant growth and providing protection against biotic and abiotic stresses [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, the endophytic DNA will be mixed into the host genome during extraction and bias the studies of the host plant. Various endophytes have been isolated in 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], 
 <italic>M. glomerate</italic> [
 <xref rid="B26-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This suggests that endophytes removal becomes an obligatory step in related plant genomic research. To obtain aseptic plantlets, the explants of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> were collected and disinfected using the common disinfectant. As observed in in vitro antibiotic-free culture of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic>, endophytic bacteria did grow on antibiotic-free media, indicating that surface disinfection was ineffective in obtaining the aseptic 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> as other 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> spp. It has been noted that a &gt;90% contamination rate is not extraordinary in initially established in vitro culture [
