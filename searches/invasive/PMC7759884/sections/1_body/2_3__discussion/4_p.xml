<p>Although 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> represents a valuable species for comparative study with 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic>, its genome resources are lacking. The chromosome number of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> is 2n = 36 [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], but the genomics information remains absent to date. As plant genomes are generally giant, genome survey by next-generation sequencing offers an affordable way to characterize the genome before conducting costly long-read genome sequencing [
 <xref rid="B46-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Similar strategies have been applied to 
 <italic>Betula platyphylla</italic> [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], 
 <italic>Pistacia vera</italic> [
 <xref rid="B48-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and 
 <italic>Rhododendron micranthum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B49-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Genome survey sequencing has been shown that it enables to provide a preliminary understanding of such genomic characteristics as genome size, heterozygosity, and repetitive rate. In this study, we have conducted genome survey sequencing of the in vivo and in vitro culture of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic>, respectively. By surveying in vitro plantlets, the genomic characteristics may be assessed more accurately. The genome size of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> was estimated at 1.80 Gb, which is typical in Asteraceae [
 <xref rid="B50-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and comparable with its congeneric 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> of 1.86 Gb [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, this size is much smaller than that of 
 <italic>Helianthus annuus</italic> (3.6 Gb) [
 <xref rid="B51-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Several studies have proposed that invasive species with more plasticity tend to have smaller genomes in comparison to their non-invasive relatives [
 <xref rid="B52-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Nevertheless, our results highlight that the genome size of invasive species can be larger than that of the native species. We speculate that the large genome of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> may be associated with its CAM photosynthetic characteristics [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], since CAM plant tends to have low stomatal density [
 <xref rid="B54-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], which is further negatively correlated with genome size [
 <xref rid="B55-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Moreover, the estimated repetitive rate of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> (78.35%) is found higher than that of most published genomes of Asteraceae plants, such as 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> (73.12%) [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], 
 <italic>Erigeron breviscapus</italic> (54.58%) [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], and 
 <italic>Taraxacum kok-saghyz</italic> (68.56%) [
 <xref rid="B57-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In this study, we observed that the contaminant DNA may mislead the estimate of genomic characterization. Compared with in vitro plantlets, the proportion of heterozygous 17-mer derived from in vivo plant shows an increase in 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic>; but the proportion of repetitive 17-mer demonstrates a decrease. This may cause the heterozygosity overestimated and the repetitive rate underestimated. The contaminants may also lead to 14.82 Mb (0.82% of the whole genome) overestimation of the genome size. Our results are in contrast to the genome survey sequencing of 
 <italic>B. platyphylla</italic> [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], which showed that contaminants brought no interference to genomic characterization.
