<p>Before sequencing the in vitro plantlets of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic>, we sampled the greenhouse-grown 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> for genome survey sequencing and observed 8.7% (10.5 of 120.1 Gb) microbial sequences in clean reads. The contamination in DNA sequencing of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> is much higher than that in RNA-Seq of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> where only 0.076% unigenes were identified as fungi-origin sequences [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Blast results validate that the most dominant contaminant in 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> is 
 <italic>Fusarium fujikuroi</italic>, a filamentous fungus. Similarly, 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> has also been found in 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> rhizosphere but not very abundant [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The contaminant DNA will not only take up part of the sequencing resources but also mislead assembly; thus, the in vitro aseptic plantlets were used for genome survey sequencing again. There were only 0.06% (0.1 of 154.3 Gb) clean reads belonging to microbes and the stray region in GC depth distribution became dramatically shrunk, which supported that the micropropagation protocol was a success in reducing the endophytes of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic>. A few remaining contigs in the stray region were identified as 
 <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> spp. which had also been isolated from the leaves of 
 <italic>M. glomerate</italic> [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This study again suggested that the micropropagation media incorporating antibiotics can effectively eliminate the covert endophytes in 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic>. Our protocol may promote the availability of aseptic 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> in future studies and be potentially applied to other plants whose genome sequencing is interfered with endophytes.
