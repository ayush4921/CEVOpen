<p>It is conventional to perform simple sequence repeats (SSRs) analyses in genome survey. Due to the low contaminant level of in vitro plantlet, we used its scaffolds for SSRs identification. Additionally, to our knowledge, this study has reported the genomic SSRs of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> for the first time. In total, 289,831 SSRs have been identified, which are much more abundant than the 3,602 EST-SSRs identified in 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> [
 <xref rid="B60-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The most common motifs of mono-, di, and trinucleotide in 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> are A/T, AT/AT, and AAT/ATT, respectively. The same pattern has been documented in other plants like jujube, grape, and mulberry [
 <xref rid="B61-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The genomic SSRs developed here would be useful to assess the genetic diversity in 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> and examine the transferability in 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> [
 <xref rid="B62-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,
 <xref rid="B63-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].
