<p>Furthermore, 1.05 Gb scaffolds were generated from in vitro plantlets, which only covers 58.33% of the estimated genome. This relatively low genome coverage is not unexpected since the high repetitive rate of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> may considerably inhibit the assembly of short reads. The longest scaffold generated from the in vivo plant is extremely long (4.29 Mb). Almost all the abnormal long scaffolds from in vivo plant were found aligned with microbial sequences. This finding is in line with the genome survey sequencing of 
 <italic>Hypsibius dujardini</italic> and 
 <italic>B. platyphylla</italic>, where the extremely long but low-abundance assemblies were identified as contaminant sequences [

 <xref rid="B58-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In this study, the microbial scaffolds were eliminated from the scaffolds generated from in vitro plantlets. The existence of microbial scaffolds as well as their misleading effects on assembly stresses the necessity to produce in vitro aseptic plantlets of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> for future long-read sequencing. It is of note that as much as 76.08% of core eukaryotic genes were found in our assemblies. The percentage is lower than that derived from the high-quality genome of 
 <italic>M. micrantha</italic> (91%) [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] but higher than other assemblies based on short-read sequencing [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B59-plants-09-01665" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Of scaffold assemblies, the gene coverage was higher than the genome coverage. This might be linked to that hard-to-assemble repetitive regions are gene-poor.
