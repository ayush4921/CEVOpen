<p id="p0010">In 1973, evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky penned a famous essay titled “Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution” (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Dobzhansky, 1973</xref>). In the essay, he described how many features of biology, such as the adaptive radiations of 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> fruit flies and the similarity of embryo development across animal species, are best explained by evolution. Although Dobzhansky's examples largely came from the animal kingdom, evolution is also the chief unifying theory in plant biology, linking molecular, cell, and whole organism-level phenomena. 
 <italic>Plant Communications</italic> is intended to represent all of the plant sciences, and evolution can provide connections between the diverse studies published in the journal. This is illustrated by this special issue on 
 <italic>Plant Evolutionary Adaptation</italic>, in which evolutionary approaches are employed to explain phenomena ranging from the geographic distribution of genomic variation to patterns of plant dispersal to the success of invasive species. Here we provide background for the topics addressed by these studies and highlight their main conclusions, moving from molecular to organismal-level studies.
