<p id="p0055">The final paper in the special issue investigates the evolution of a mutualism using the classic model legume–rhizobia system. Mutualisms refer to interactions between two (or more) species in which both species benefit. Evolutionary theory predicts that traits that enhance mutualisms will be favored by selection, reducing variation in those traits. Nonetheless, studies of mutualisms often report considerable variation in fitness-enhancing traits. A possible solution to this conundrum is that genotype-by-environment (G × E) interactions are common in mutualisms. Under this assumption, genotypes that perform well in one environment do poorly in another, ensuring that variation is maintained. 
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Vaidya and Stinchcombe (2020)</xref> tested this hypothesis by examining the performance of 50 legume genotypes in different light environments. Changes in genotype fitness rank were observed across light environments, confirming that, as predicted, G × E is responsible for the maintenance of variation in mutualism-enhancing traits in this system.
