<p id="p0020">Several studies employ evolutionary theory to understand patterns of sequence and structural variation within and between species. At the most basic level, such patterns will depend on the action of evolutionary forces such as mutation, genetic drift, gene flow, and recombination. Evolutionist biologists are particularly interested in identifying the footprints of natural selection. This is surprisingly challenging because demographic processes such as population bottlenecks and population expansions can create extreme drift, leading to patterns of genomic variation that are similar to those caused by positive selection. An especially convincing sign of natural selection is the repetition of evolutionary changes in similar environments (i.e., convergent evolution), as such a pattern is unlikely to result from drift. In this issue, 
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Xu etÂ al. (2020)</xref> explore evidence for convergent genomic evolution due to repeated adaptation to extreme environments. They point out that convergence can occur at different levels, from individual sites to genes to genetic pathways to genome-wide changes such as amino acid usage and GC content. They report that convergent evolution at individual sites is rare and prone to false positives, but that multiple forms of convergence at higher genetic levels are common. For example, mangroves exhibit repeated changes in amino acid composition, as well as convergent reductions in transposable element content and genome size. The authors note that with the rapid accumulation of genome sequence data for extremophile taxa, tests for convergent changes will become increasingly powerful.
