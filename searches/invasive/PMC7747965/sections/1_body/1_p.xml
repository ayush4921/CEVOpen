<p id="p0015">Early studies of molecular adaptation in plants (and animals) focused on changes in amino acid sequences of proteins. Only with the genomic revolution in the 21st century did it become clear that variation in gene number plays a profoundly important role in plant adaptation as well. However, the focus to date has mainly been on gene duplications rather than gene losses or pseudogene formation. Studies of plant domestication have been an exception to this rule, and loss-of-function (LOF) mutations are known to underlie a number of key domestication phenotypes. Whether such mutations also contribute importantly to adaptation in natural populations is less clear, since LOF mutations in domesticates are established by artificial rather than natural selection. In this issue, 
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Xu and Guo (2020)</xref> clarify this topic by reviewing what we know about LOF mutations. They describe the evolutionary events that lead to LOF mutations and show that such mutations are abundant in natural populations. Whereas most LOF mutations are likely neutral or deleterious, the authors describe a number of cases in which such mutations are advantageous, and evidence suggests that these examples represent the “tip of the iceberg.” The authors further note that LOF mutations represent a valuable resource for functional studies of genes in non-model organisms, as well as for crop improvement.
