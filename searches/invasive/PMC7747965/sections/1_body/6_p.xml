<p id="p0040">Two studies in this issue examine the evolution of polyploid species. Polyploidy or whole-genome duplication is a favorite subject of plant evolutionary biologists because it represents an extreme macromutation with profound ecological and evolutionary consequences. Polyploids in which duplicated genomes derive from the same species are called autopolyploids, whereas polyploids with duplicated genomes from different species are termed allopolyploids. Whereas autopolyploids arise more frequently than allopolyploids, the latter are more likely to become established due to hybrid vigor, although other factors likely contribute as well. 
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Meeus etÂ al. (2020)</xref> use natural and synthetic allopolyploids in 
 <italic>Mimulus</italic> monkeyflowers to explore the evolutionary consequences of allopolyploidy. They report that whole-genome duplication does result in the recovery of hybrid fertility and in the generation of a reproductive barrier with the parental species (i.e., speciation). The polyploids also exhibit predicted increases in size and development time. Interestingly, the natural allopolyploid outperforms the synthetic polyploid and parental species in the field, suggestive of an important role for adaptive evolution in successful polyploid establishment.
