<p id="p0025">Selection acting on the sporophytic stage of the seed plant life cycle is straightforward to envision and has been the main focus of plant evolutionary biologists. However, it is important to keep in mind that selection can also act on the gametophytic stage. Furthermore, as pointed out in a review of the genomics of gametophytic selection (
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Beaudry et al., 2020</xref>) in this issue, gametophytes are haploid and lack heterozygosity, so selection will act more efficiently on both deleterious and dominant mutations than in diploid sporophytes. Beaudry et al. describe the different ways gametophytes may experience selection, including competition among male gametophytes (i.e., pollen competition), as well as sexual conflict, coevolution, and pleiotropy between male and female gametophytes and the sporophyte. The authors compile evidence from experimental and expression studies, which supports the likely importance of these different kinds of selection on gene, genome, and phenotypic evolution. They also provide useful suggestions for future studies, noting that population genomic contrasts involving different mating systems, ploidy levels, and sex chromosomes offer a means of assessing the strength and evolutionary importance of gametophytic selection.
