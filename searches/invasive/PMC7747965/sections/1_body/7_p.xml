<p id="p0045">The second study of polyploidy takes a closer look at the origin and evolution of three tetraploid species of eyebrights (
 <italic>Euphrasia</italic>), which are semi-parasites of grass species (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Becher etÂ al., 2020</xref>). The authors employ a common garden study to show that the phenotypic differences defining the tetraploid species are genetically controlled. They also generate whole-genome sequence data for the three species, which they use to demonstrate that the tetraploids are of hybrid origin (i.e., allopolyploidy). The species are not strongly reproductively isolated, and heterogeneous patterns of genomic differentiation combined with significant deviations in Patterson's 
 <italic>D</italic> statistic are consistent with a reticulate evolutionary history. The authors conclude that the exchange of ancient variation through introgression may contribute to adaptive divergence and reproductive isolation in this group.
