<p>Our recent work also found 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> invasion to lead to substantial losses of soil nitrogen (Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), which provides a good opportunity for soil remediation by leguminous plants such as 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic>. We found ammonium and microbial biomass nitrogen in 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> soils to be high at later growth stages (120 days). However, nitrate and total nitrogen did not change over the same time period in these soils. On the other hand, nitrate and total nitrogen were higher in 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> than 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> soils. This may reflect the ability of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> to fix atmospheric nitrogen through its association with rhizobium bacteria. This may provide 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> with a further competitive advantage over 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> when competing for available nitrogen sources essential for rapid growth.
