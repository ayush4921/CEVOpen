<p>The higher performance of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> compared to 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> that we observed for germination and seedling growth, as well as allelopathy, was also mirrored in plant performance under interspecific competition. That is, 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> negatively affected 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> while 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> had the opposite effect on 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic>. Previous work also found sweet potato to have similar effects on 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> (Shen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Both 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> and 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> are perennial evergreen vines with large capacities for asexual propagation, and the two species share many morphological similarities, occupying virtually the same niche in agroforestry systems (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Lian et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). Our results provide some evidence for competitive exclusion of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> by 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic>, suggesting that native species with similar traits, and with similar niche requirements to non‐native species, may impede invasion (Emery, 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; MacDougall et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Tillering, branching, and plant height are important traits that facilitate competition in plants, and have been considered important for pre‐empting resources during scramble competition (Jiang et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). The branch number and plant height of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> in the present study markedly decreased with higher planting ratios of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> to 
 <italic>Mikania</italic>. It is noteworthy that 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> is also a highly successful invasive species outside of its native range (Bentley &amp; Mauricio, 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Kartzinel et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>).
