<p>The apparent superior competitive ability of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> could also be related to its photosynthetic characteristics. We found that gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters give 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> an apparent advantage over 
 <italic>Mikania</italic>. 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> produced much more leaf biomass per plant than 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> under interspecific competition, which resulted in partial shading of the latter's leaves. The lower growth irradiance to which 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> leaves were exposed due to lower light availability under these conditions may also cause lower Rubisco and cytochrome 
 <italic>bf</italic> content. The latter is often a rate‐limiting bottleneck in electron flow from PSII to PSI (Anderson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1988</xref>). Since 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> is intrinsically heliophilic, with a high light compensation point of photosynthesis (1,002 μmol m
 <sup>−2</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup>) (Wen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>), it is capable of rapid growth under high light conditions. However, there is a sharp decline in this response under shaded conditions (Liao et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>), making it be vulnerable to competition.
