<p>Both our phytochemical and interspecific competition experiments supported the hypothesis of competitive exclusion of invasive 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> by native 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic>. Plants can affect their neighbors in numerous ways through the release of phytochemical compounds into the environment (He et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). For example, inhibitory allelopathic chemicals are widely reported as major contributors to enhanced interspecific competition (Bais et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>; Callaway &amp; Ridenour, 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>; Inderjit et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>; Yuan et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Our results showed that the total synthetical effects of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> on 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> were much higher than vice versa, indicating strong inhibitory effects of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> on 
 <italic>Mikania</italic>. A possible explanation for this could be the release of allelochemicals by 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> which enhance its competitive ability (i.e., interference competition) over 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> by affecting the early growth performance of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic>. Others have also found 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> to be very sensitive to allelopathic chemicals produced by native plants (e.g., 
 <italic>Dicranopteris pedate;</italic> Zhao et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>).
