<p>When 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> was grown alone or in lower mix ratios of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> to 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> (1:3), the maximal photochemical efficiency (
 <italic>Fv</italic>/
 <italic>Fm</italic>) of dark‐relaxed Photosystem II (the photosystem that splits water to evolved oxygen) decreased significantly compared to that of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> grown with higher mix ratios of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> to 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> (2:2 and 3:1) (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36938-tbl-0007" ref-type="table">7</xref>). However, the photochemical yield (Yield) of photosystem II of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> under illumination and the highest 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> to 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> mix ratio (i.e., 3:1) was significantly lower than in other planting arrangements (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36938-tbl-0007" ref-type="table">7</xref>). The electron transport rate (ETR) of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic>, estimated by chlorophyll fluorescence, decreased significantly as the mix ratio of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> to 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> increased. Changes in Rubisco (the enzyme complex that fixes CO
 <sub>2</sub> in plant leaves) showed a similar trend (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36938-tbl-0007" ref-type="table">7</xref>). However, 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> showed the opposite trend for chlorophyll fluorescence parameters. First, Fv/Fm of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> was not affected by any of the competition treatments. Secondly, Yield, ETR, and Rubisco of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> increased significantly as 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> to 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> mix ratios increased (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36938-tbl-0007" ref-type="table">7</xref>).
