<p>Following 120 days of growth, ammonium and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) were the highest in 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> soils among the three soils we analyzed, while nitrate nitrogen and total nitrogen were higher in 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> soils than in 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> soils. There were no significant differences in nitrate nitrogen and total nitrogen between 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> soils and the initial soils (Table
