<p>Total biomass, stem biomass, and root biomass of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> were significantly lower in all three competition treatments compared to when grown alone after 60 days of growth (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36938-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). These biomass fractions were significantly lower in the 2M2P and 1M3P than in the 4M and 3M1P planting arrangements after 90 days of growth (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36938-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Stem biomass decreased gradually from 4M to 1M3P over the same period. Changes in the total biomass and leaf biomass significantly decreased in the order of: 1M3P &lt; 2M2P &lt; 3M1P &lt; 4M, following 120 days of growth (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36938-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Stem biomass and root biomass showed a similar trend (1M3P &lt; 2M2P ~ 3M1P &lt; 4M) as the mix ratio of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> to 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> increased (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36938-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).
