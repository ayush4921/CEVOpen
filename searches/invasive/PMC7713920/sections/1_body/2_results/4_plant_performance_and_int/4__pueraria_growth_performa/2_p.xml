<p>In early growth stages (i.e., after 60 days), there was no significant difference in root length of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> seedlings between planting arrangements (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36938-tbl-0006" ref-type="table">6</xref>). In mid‐growth stages (i.e., after 90 days), seedling root length in 1P3M was significantly higher than for the other treatments and in late growth stages (i.e., after 120 days of growth), and 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> root length gradually increased with an increase in 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> to 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> planting ratios (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36938-tbl-0006" ref-type="table">6</xref>). Variation in plant height followed a similar pattern (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36938-tbl-0006" ref-type="table">6</xref>). Plant height of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> in all the three competition treatments was higher than that of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> grown by itself (4P) after 90 days of growth, and increased significantly as the ratios of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> to 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> increased after 120 days of growth (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36938-tbl-0006" ref-type="table">6</xref>). The number of branches of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> did not differ for the first 90 days and at 120 days between treatments, but they were higher in higher ratios of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> to 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> (1P3M and 2P2M) than in lower ratios (3P1M and 4P; Table 
 <xref rid="ece36938-tbl-0006" ref-type="table">6</xref>).
