<p>Photosensitivity of seed germination has a significant effect on the survival and establishment of plants (Finch‐Savage &amp; Leubner‐Metzger, 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). It was previously reported that 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> seeds do not germinate easily under dark conditions and that the soil seed bank of this species produces very few seedlings in the absence of light (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). Whether seed germination of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> is dependent on the light is not clear. We designed an experiment to test to what extend light influences the germination of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> and 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> seeds.
