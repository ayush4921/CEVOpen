<p>Twenty‐four 2 m × 2 m plots, separated by at least 50 cm, were established at the study site. All above‐ground vegetation and most roots were removed in 12 plots to mimic 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> control and removal. The remaining 12 plots were left untouched. Four sowing densities of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> (0, 100, 200, and 400 grains/m
 <sup>2</sup>) were each replicated in three cleared and three uncleared plots. All seeds were treated with H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> and sown after radicle emergence. 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> and 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> plants in each plot were harvested six months after sowing and fresh above‐ground biomass (stem + leaf material) determined for each species. Samples were also oven‐dried to determine dry weight.
