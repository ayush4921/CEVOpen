<p>We calculated the relative interaction index (RII) (Armas et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>; Domènech &amp; Vilà, 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>; Li et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) to estimate the intensity of competition as RII = (
 <italic>Bw</italic> − 
 <italic>Bo</italic>)/(
 <italic>Bw</italic> + 
 <italic>Bo</italic>), where 
 <italic>Bw</italic> is the individual biomass of the target plant when growing with another plant (i.e., under interspecific competition), and 
 <italic>Bo</italic> is the individual biomass of the target plant when growing by itself (i.e., under intraspecific competition) after 120 days. RII has value range from −1 to +1, with negative values indicating competition (i.e., growth of the target species is reduced) while positive values indicate facilitation (i.e., growth of the target species is promoted).
