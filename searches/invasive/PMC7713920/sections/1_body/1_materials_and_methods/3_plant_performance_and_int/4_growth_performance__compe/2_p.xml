<p>Plant height, root length, number of branches, and biomass were determined for all five replicates at days 60, 90, and 120 following planting. Plant height and root length were measured with a measure tape (accuracy of 1 mm), and the number of branches was counted. Biomass was dried in oven until constant weight at 65°C before being weighed.</p>
