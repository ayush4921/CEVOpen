<p>Interspecific competition may change soil nutrient levels. Since 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> is a legume, it can elevate soil nitrogen availability through symbiosis with nitrogen‐fixing rhizobium. This may also result in changes in soil microbial biomass nitrogen. We compared soil nitrogen and the soil microbial biomass nitrogen between 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> and 
 <italic>Mikania</italic>. For each species, plants from five pots (grown in monoculture) were excavated and rhizosphere soils collected after 120 days of growth. Total nitrogen content of these soils was determined using the Kjeldahl method (air‐dried soil passed through a 0.15‐mm sieve), while levels of
