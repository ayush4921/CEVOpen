<p>In order to explore how the environmental factors and the host species influenced the composition and competitiveness of 
 <italic>Mimosa</italic> symbionts, we performed this study to investigate the 
 <italic>Mimosa</italic> symbionts in in different geographic regions for evaluating the competitiveness of different rhizobial species associated with invasive 
 <italic>Mimosa</italic> spp. under varied soil traits (organic matter, 
 <italic>N</italic>, 
 <italic>P</italic>, 
 <italic>K</italic>, and pH).
