<p>Leguminous plants are important for their ability to fix-nitrogen in symbiosis with rhizobia, which makes them critical ecologically and economically. Ecologically, the symbiotic 
 <italic>N</italic>-fixation not only supply the 
 <italic>N</italic> nutrition to the host legume, but also enhance the soil 
 <italic>N</italic> content by its root and shoot remnants (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, the wide distribution and specificity between the legume species and their microsymbionts make the same legume species form symbiosis with distinct rhizobial populations/species in the different geographic regions. Therefore, the growth of a legume plant in a certain region could enrich its corresponding rhizobia adapted to the local environment, e.g., the rhizobia are selected by both the host legumes and the soil conditions, mainly soil pH, nutrient (
 <italic>N</italic>, 
 <italic>P</italic>, 
 <italic>K</italic> and organic material) contents, and salinity (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). With the mentioned concern, characterization rhizobia associated with the same legume species grown in different regions will help to understand the evolution or diversification of rhizobia under the double selection from both the host plant and the soil condition, as well as help for screening the high effective rhizobial strains in agricultural sustainable development.
