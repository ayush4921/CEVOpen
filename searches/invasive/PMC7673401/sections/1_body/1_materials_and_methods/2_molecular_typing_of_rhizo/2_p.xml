 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Laguerre et al., 1994</xref>) as specified by the manufacturer with an excess of enzyme (5 U per reaction). The restriction fragments were separated by horizontal electrophoresis in agarose (2%, w/v) gels (14 cm in length) at 80 V for 3 h and were visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. Strains or isolates with different RFLP patterns were designated into distinct rDNA types. The BOX-AIR products were separated by electrophoresis in 1.5% (w/v) agarose gels containing ethidium bromide and were photographed under UV light. The BOX profiles were distinguished by their different band patterns, e.g., the isolates sharing the same pattern were designed as the same BOX pattern.
