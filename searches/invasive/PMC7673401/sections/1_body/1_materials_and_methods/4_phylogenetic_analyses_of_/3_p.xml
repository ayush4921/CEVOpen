<p>Fragments of the symbiosis genes 
 <italic>nifH</italic> and 
 <italic>nodA</italic> genes were amplified and sequenced using primers reported previously (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Haukka et al., 1998</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Laguerre et al., 2001</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2012</xref>) as well as with the new primers designed in this study (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). The visualization purification and sequencing of the 
 <italic>nifH</italic> and 
 <italic>nodA</italic> amplicons were performed same as that mentioned for the housekeeping genes. The sequences were deposited in the NCBI database and were used for alignment and construction of the phylogenies using the same methods described above for the 16S rRNA gene.
