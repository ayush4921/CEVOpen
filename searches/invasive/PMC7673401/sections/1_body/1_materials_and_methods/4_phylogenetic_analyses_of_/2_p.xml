<p>Multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) based on the five housekeeping genes 
 <italic>atpD</italic> (encoding for the ATP synthase beta-chain), 
 <italic>recA</italic> (recombinase A), 
 <italic>dnaK</italic> (DnaK chaperone), 
 <italic>gyrB</italic> (DNA gyrase, beta-subunit), and 
 <italic>glnA</italic> (glutamine synthetase I) widely used to differentiate rhizobial species (

 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Martens et al., 2007</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) was also employed in the present study. The five genes were independently amplified using corresponding primer pairs reported in previous studies (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). The PCR products were checked by electrophoresis in 1% (w/v) agarose gel. After purified with the Solarbio DNA purification kit (Beijing Solarbio Science and Technology Co., Ltd.), the amplicons were sequenced directly using the same primers in BGI mentioned above. The separated sequences of 
 <italic>recA</italic> and the combined sequences of 
 <italic>atpD</italic>, 
 <italic>glnA</italic>, 
 <italic>gyrB</italic>, and 
 <italic>dnaK</italic>, and their combined sequences were aligned using Clustal W with those from type strains of the defined bacterial species (obtained from the NCBI database). Distance calculation and construction of the gene phylograms were performed using the Maximum likelihood method and the bootstrapping algorithms with 1000 pseudo-replicates were carried out in MEGA 6.0 (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Tamura et al., 2013</xref>). Phylogenies were also constructed using the concatenated sequences of 16S rRNA and the five housekeeping genes by Maximum likelihood method.
