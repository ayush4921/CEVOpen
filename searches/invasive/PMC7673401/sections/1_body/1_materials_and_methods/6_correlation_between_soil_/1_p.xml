<p>In order to evaluate the influence of soil characters on the symbiosis between 
 <italic>Mimosa</italic> spp. and different rhizobial types, soil, and root nodules were sampled intensively from 13 locations (59 sites) including Hepu, Beihai, and Nanning city in Guangxi (GXh,GXb, and GXn), Zhangjiang, Leizhou, Mazhang, and Foshan town in Guangdong (Gzj, Gl, Gm, and Gf), Jinhong and Mangshi town in Yunan (Yj and Ym) and Ledong, Wuzhishan, Wanning and Danzhou in Hainan (Hl, Hw, Hwn, and Hd), which were main districts for 
 <italic>Mimosa</italic> speies and habitats for diverse rhizobia. For most locations, four or more sites with minimum distance of 5 km between them were samples, except the location Mangshi town in Yunnan where rhizobial strains were isolated from only one sampling site. Soils were sampled compositely from the root zone of nodule sampled plants (5–20 cm in depth). The soil samples were dried and milled until they could pass through an 80-mesh sieve. Soil alkali-hydrolysable N, available P (using Bray’s hydrochloric acid fluoride ammonium by extraction method), and available K (by ammonium acetate extraction plus flame photometry) were determined with the standard procedures (
