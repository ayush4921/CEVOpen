<p>A total of 98 representative strains were used in the nodulation tests that were selected according to their affiliations of genotypes based on the results of 16S rRNA sequencing, protein patterns in SDS-PAGE, and genomic fingerprinting by BOX-PCR. 
 <italic>M. pudica</italic> seeds were scarified using concentrated sulfuric acid for 10 min, rinsed several times with sterile water, and then surface-sterilized in 3.2% (w/v) sodium hypochlorite followed by several rinses with sterile water. They were then placed on 0.8% water-agar at 4°C for 3 days, and after germinated at 28°C until the seedlings developed roots of 0.5–1 cm in length. Two seedlings then were transplanted into a sterile glass tubes (30 cm × 200 cm) with nitrogen-free plant nutrient solution (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Vincent, 1970</xref>) in 0.8% agar. The seedlings were then inoculated separately with 0.1 mL liquid cultures of each test strain (about 10
 <sup>8</sup> cells mL
 <sup>–1</sup>). Five replicates were used and controls without inoculation were included. The plants were placed in a growth cabinet under conditions described previously (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). The representative strains 
 <italic>Paraburkholderia</italic> spp. SWF66044, SWF66029, and 
 <italic>C. taiwanensis</italic> SWF66166, SWF66194, and SWF66322 from 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. (2012)</xref> were also used for cross-inoculation tests with ten other leguminous species: 
 <italic>Glycine max</italic> (Linn.) Merr., 
 <italic>Pisum sativum</italic> L., 
 <italic>Galega officinalis</italic> L., 
 <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic> Linn., 
 <italic>Vigna unguiculata</italic> L. Walp, 
 <italic>Lotus corniculatus</italic> L., 
 <italic>Medicago sativa</italic> L., 
 <italic>Trifolium repens</italic> L., 
 <italic>Macroptilium atropurpureum</italic> (Moc. and Sessé ex DC.) Urb. and 
 <italic>Leucaena leucocephala</italic> (Lam.) de Wit. Seed treatments and inoculation details were the same as described above. Plants were checked for nodule formation at 35 d after inoculation.
