<p>Bacterial strains were grown until the end of the exponential phase at 28°C for 2 days on YMA. The cells were collected and washed twice in 10 mM Tris–HC1, pH 7.6, the pellet obtained by centrifugation (5000 × 
 <italic>g</italic>, 10 min at 4°C) was weighed and the cells were resuspended in 10 mM Tris–HC1 to a concentration of 10 mg ml
 <sup>–1</sup> using. Then, the same volume of 2 × treatment buffer (0.5 g of SDS, 3 ml of glycerol, 1 ml of 2-mercaptoethanol, 4 mg of bromophenol blue, 2 ml of 1 M Tris-hydrochloride, and distilled water to make a final volume of 10 ml at pH 6.8) was added. The samples were incubated at 100°C for 20 min and immediately stored at −20°C after cooled on ice. The SDS-polyacrylamide gel (200 mm × 200 mm × 1 mm) were used for electrophoresis according to 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Laemmli (1970)</xref>. The samples were incubated at 100°C for 10 min before the sample loading. Twenty-five samples per gel were subjected to the discontinuous slab gel electrophoresis at 250 V in an SDS-Tris-glycine buffer system, as described by 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Laemmli (1970)</xref>. The protein patterns were visualized by silver staining (
