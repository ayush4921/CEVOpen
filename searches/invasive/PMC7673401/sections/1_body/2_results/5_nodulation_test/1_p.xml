<p>All 98 representative strains selected from different groups according to their patterns in 16S rRNA PCR-RFLP, SDS-PAGE protein and BOX-PCR profiles (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2012</xref>) formed nodules on 
 <italic>M. pudica</italic>. Cross-inoculation studies showed that only the invasive mimosoid legume, 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>leucocephala</italic> could nodulate with all five test strains (
 <italic>Paraburkholderia</italic> spp. SWF66044, SWF66029, 
 <italic>C. taiwanensis</italic> SWF66166, SWF66194, and SWF66322), which is in keeping with its neotropical origin, close relatedness to 
 <italic>Mimosa</italic>, and its known promiscuity.
