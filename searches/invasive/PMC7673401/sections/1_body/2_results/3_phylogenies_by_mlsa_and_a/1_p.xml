<p>Out of the total collection, 34 strains (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS2">Supplementary Table S2</xref>) were selected according to their different rRNA types, protein patterns, BOX profiles, host species and collected sites for full 16S rRNA and housekeeping gene sequencing. The relationships of the 
 <italic>Mimosa</italic> isolates were high similar in 16S rRNA gene phylogeny (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS2">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>) and in the MLSA-based phylogeny deduced from the concatenated sequences of 16S rRNA and the five housekeeping genes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Five groups were defined among the beta-rhizobial isolates at the species level (similarities ≥96.4%), which corresponded to (1) 
 <italic>P. mimosarum</italic> (
 <italic>Paraburkholderia</italic> rRNA type I), (2) 
 <italic>P. phymatum</italic> (
 <italic>Paraburkholderia</italic> rRNA type II), (3) 
 <italic>P. caribensis</italic> (
 <italic>Paraburkholderia</italic> rRNA type III), (4) 
 <italic>C. taiwanensis</italic> (
 <italic>Cupriavidus</italic> rRNA types I), and (5) 
 <italic>Cupriavidus</italic> sp. SWF66294 (
 <italic>Cupriavidus</italic> rRNA types II). The 
 <italic>Rhizobium</italic> isolates obtained in this study were grouped into three species corresponding to 
 <italic>R. etli</italic>, 
 <italic>R. mesoamericanum</italic>, and 
 <italic>R. altiplani</italic>. The phylogenies of the individual housekeeping genes (
 <italic>atpD</italic>, 
 <italic>recA</italic>, 
 <italic>dnaK</italic>, 
 <italic>gyrB</italic>, and 
 <italic>glnA</italic>) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figures S1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS5">S5</xref>) were generally consistent with that of 16S rRNA gene and the MLSA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), except the isolates of 
 <italic>R. etli</italic> that was a unique linage separated from all the defined species in 
 <italic>atpD</italic> phylogenetic tree (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS3">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>).
