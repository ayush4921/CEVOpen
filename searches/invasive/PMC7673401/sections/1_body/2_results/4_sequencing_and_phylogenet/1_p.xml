<p>This analysis were performed for the 34 representative strains mentioned above. Four 
 <italic>nodA</italic> and four 
 <italic>nifH</italic> lineages were defined among them (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS6">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>). The phylogenies of the 
 <italic>nodA</italic> and 
 <italic>nifH</italic> genes of the isolates were the same and they were incongruent in several cases with that of the housekeeping genes, e.g., both the Alpha-and Beta-rhizobia formed two clades and they were intermingled. 
 <italic>P. caribensis</italic> strains and 
 <italic>P. phymatum</italic> strains shared similar symbiosis genes, while 
 <italic>P. mimosarum</italic> presented another lineage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS6">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>). The strains in both 
 <italic>Cupriavidus</italic> genotypes I and II, including 
 <italic>C. taiwanensis</italic> LMG19424
 <sup>T</sup>, formed the third lineage in the symbiosis gene phylogeny, which was inserted between the two lineages of the 
 <italic>Paraburkholderia</italic> species. All the three 
 <italic>Rhizobium</italic> species identified in the present study shared the same symbiosis gene and formed the forth lineage represented by that of 
 <italic>R. mesoamericanum</italic> STM3625 isolated from 
 <italic>M. pudica</italic> in Mexico.
