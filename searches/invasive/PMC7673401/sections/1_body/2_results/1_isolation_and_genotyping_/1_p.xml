<p>In total, 361 strains were isolated from the nodules of 
 <italic>M. pudica</italic> and 
 <italic>M. diplotricha</italic> sampled in the 25 locations in southern China (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The majority of the isolates were obtained from 
 <italic>M. pudica</italic> (83.7%), and minor from 
 <italic>M. diplotricha</italic> (16.3%), which most likely reflects the relative abundance of these two plant species in the sampling sites. By 16S rRNA PCR-RFLP analysis, six rRNA types were revealed (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which were recognized as members of 
 <italic>Paraburkholderia</italic> (three rRNA types with 55, 57, and 9 strains; 33.5%), 
 <italic>Cupriavidus</italic> (two rRNA of types with 98 and 128 strains; 62.6%) and 
 <italic>Rhizobium</italic> (a single rRNA type with 9 strains; 3.9%). 
 <italic>Paraburkholderia</italic> genotypes I and II, 
 <italic>Cupriavidus</italic> genotypes I and II, as well as 
 <italic>Rhizobium</italic> genotype were isolated from both 
 <italic>M. pudica</italic> and 
 <italic>M. diplotricha</italic>; while. 
 <italic>Paraburkholderia</italic> genotype III was only isolated from 
 <italic>M. pudica</italic>.
