<p>In analyses of genetic diversity, a total of 97 protein profiles and 51 BOX PCR profiles were distinguished among the 361 strains (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), revealing a high level of diversity among them. 
 <italic>Paraburkholderia</italic> rRNA type I contains 18 protein profiles and 10 BOX PCR profiles; 
 <italic>Paraburkholderia</italic> rRNA type II contains 11 protein profiles and 6 BOX PCR profiles; and 
 <italic>Paraburkholderia</italic> rRNA type III contains 3 protein profiles and 3 BOX PCR profiles; 
 <italic>Cupriavidus</italic> rRNA type I contains 27 protein profiles and 16 BOX PCR profiles; and 
 <italic>Cupriavidus</italic> rRNA type II contains 31 protein profiles and 9 BOX PCR profiles. 
 <italic>Rhizobium</italic> rRNA type contains 7 protein profiles and 7 BOX PCR profiles. The greater number of patterns in the 
 <italic>Cupriavidus</italic> populations suggested that they were more diverse than the 
 <italic>Paraburkholderia</italic> populations.
