<p>In total, the 59 sampling sites were plotted onto the soil-site PCA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), and the rhizobial species that were isolated from each site and isolates numbers are indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS3">Supplementary Table S3</xref>. Four soil types corresponded to the localization site of the different rhizobial types associated with 
 <italic>Mimosa</italic> in southern China. Soil category I (32 sites, 115 isolates) was the major soil type characterized by low fertility, relatively high available 
 <italic>P</italic>, and neutral-alkaline pH and occupied by the majority of the 
 <italic>Mimosa</italic> symbionts obtained in this study. In this type of soil, the rhizobial community contained 37.4% 
 <italic>Cupriavidus</italic>, 23.5% 
 <italic>P. mimosarum</italic>, 23.5% 
 <italic>P. phymatum</italic> and 15.5% 
 <italic>Rhizobium</italic> spp. strains which covered 75% of the 
 <italic>Cupriavidus</italic> isolates, 50% of the 
 <italic>P. mimosarum</italic>, 43% of the 
 <italic>P. phymatum</italic> and 62% of the 
 <italic>Rhizobium</italic> spp. strains. Soil category II (10 sites, 28 isoates) harbored 35.7% 
 <italic>Cupriavidus</italic>, 17.9% 
 <italic>P. mimosarum</italic>, 35.7% 
 <italic>P. phymatum</italic>, and 10.7% 
 <italic>Rhizobium</italic> spp. strains; it characterized by intermediate fertility and neutral pH. Soil category III (11strains, 37 isoates) tended to acid-neutral pH, with lower fertility and lower available 
 <italic>P</italic> and 
 <italic>K</italic>; it contained 2.7% 
 <italic>Cupriavidus</italic> (1 strain), 16.2% 
 <italic>P. mimosarum</italic>, 48.6% 
 <italic>P. phymatum</italic>, and 32.5% 
 <italic>Rhizobium</italic> spp. strains. Soil category IV (5 sites, 17 isoates) was quite acidic with high fertility, but with low available 
 <italic>P</italic>; it harbored the rhizobial community with 17.6% 
 <italic>Cupriavidus</italic>, 52.9% 
 <italic>P. mimosarum</italic> and 29.5% 
 <italic>P. phymatum</italic> strains.
