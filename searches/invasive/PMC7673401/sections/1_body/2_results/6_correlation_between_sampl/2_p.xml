<p>The locations and the soil parameters within each sampling site were analyzed via cluster analysis by SPSS and PCA, which revealed main four groups with distinct soil patterns, an unusual soil site as another type for 
 <italic>Cupriavidus</italic> spp. surviving (because it is distant from other soil point) was not considered (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). We obtained 200 rhizobial strains from the 59 sites and they were identified into four groups as 
 <italic>Cupriavidus</italic> spp., 
 <italic>P. mimosarum</italic>, 
 <italic>P. phymatum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Rhizobium</italic> spp., and each group grown soil nutrition and pH range displayed as 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. In PCA, only the existence (not abundance) of the different group in each site was considered, and they were in relation to their spatial distribution (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The soil PCA resulted in three components with eigenvalues greater than one which explained 75.3% of the total variance (first component: 47.7%, second component: 27.6%, third component: 14.2%). However, the third component did not provide any further information above the first two components, and hence was excluded from the interpretation. The first component revealed the positive correlation of OM and available 
 <italic>N</italic>, and a contrasting correlation of these with pH (loading factors = 0.58, 0.60, and 0.37, respectively) with soil types I, II, III, and IV; the second component is characterized by a positive correlation of available 
 <italic>P</italic> and available 
 <italic>K</italic> (loading factors = 0.55, 0.73). On the PCA scatter plot, the four soil patterns are almost completely separated.
