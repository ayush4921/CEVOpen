<p>In summary, five beta-rhizobial species, especially 
 <italic>Cupriavidus</italic> genotype II, with great genetic diversity as the dominant microsymbionts and three 
 <italic>Rhizobium</italic> species as minor microsymbionts for 
 <italic>M. pudica</italic> and 
 <italic>M. diplotricha</italic> plants were detected in a vast sampling area in China. Most of them have been found in both the invasive regions and the centers of origin of these plants, but 
 <italic>Cupriavidus</italic> genotype II might be a novel symbiont for 
 <italic>Mimosa</italic> species evolved in China.
