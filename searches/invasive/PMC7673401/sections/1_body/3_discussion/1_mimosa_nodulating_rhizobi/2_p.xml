<p>Although four of the six beta-rhizobial genotypes/species defined among the symbionts of 
 <italic>Mimosa diplotricha</italic> and 
 <italic>M. pudica</italic> in southern China (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were commonly associated with 
 <italic>Mimosa</italic> species in both their native and invasive regions. The 
 <italic>Cupriavidus</italic> sp. represented by strains SWF66294 covering 128 isolates was unique in China. The presence of identical 
 <italic>nodA</italic> and 
 <italic>nifH</italic> in 
 <italic>Cupriavidus</italic> sp. and in 
 <italic>C. taiwanensis</italic> might be evidence that lateral transfer of symbiosis gene between these two species has happened, as reported in the 
 <italic>Lotus</italic>-nodulation 
 <italic>Mesorhizobium</italic> species (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bamba et al., 2019</xref>). The situation in the three Rhizobium species was similar. In addition, the intermingling of the Alpha-and Beta-rhizobial clades in the phylogenies of symbiosis genes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS6">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>) also demonstrating the lateral transfer of symbiosis gene between these two rhizobial categories, as estimated previously (see review of 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Andrews et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, new symbionts of 
 <italic>Mimosa</italic> has been evolved in China under the double selection from host plant (for symbiotic gene background) and the soil conditions (for survival in the local sites). Previously 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Gehlot et al. (2013)</xref> estimated that invasive 
 <italic>Mimosa</italic> spp. do not interact with the symbionts of native legumes; however, the 
 <italic>Mimosa</italic> species could get novel symbiosis adapted to their invaded region by lateral transfer of the symbiosis genes from its known rhizobia to the native relatives. 
 <italic>Cupriavidus</italic> sp. may constitute a new species intermediate between 
 <italic>C. taiwanensis</italic> and 
 <italic>C. nantongensis</italic> (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2016</xref>), but more analyses are required to clarify its species affiliation, such as DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) and/or average nucleotide identity (ANI) with the closest type strains.
