 <italic>Rhizobium</italic> was isolated as minor group from the 
 <italic>Mimosa</italic> species in this study (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and most of them (12 of the 14 strains) were from Hainan Province, with few isolates from Yunnan (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2012</xref>) and Guangxi (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Based upon the MLSA results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) these strains were idertified as 
 <italic>R. mesoamericanum</italic>, 
 <italic>R. etli</italic>, and 
 <italic>R. altiplani</italic>, while all of them were identified as sv. mimosa according to the nodA and nifG phylogenies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS6">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>). Previously, 
 <italic>R. etli</italic> sv. mimosae has isolated from invasive Mimosa species in low frequency (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2001</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2003b</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2005a</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Elliott et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Klonowska et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Mishra et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Melkonian et al., 2014</xref>), while both 
 <italic>R. etli</italic> and 
 <italic>R. mesoamericanum</italic> were found to be predominate in 
 <italic>Mimosa</italic> symbionts in Mexico, the second largest center of 
 <italic>Mimosa</italic> diversity (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 1999</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Bontemps et al., 2016</xref>). The exception is 
 <italic>R. altiplani</italic>, which is relatively common in central Brazil (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bara√∫na et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">de Castro Pires et al., 2018</xref>), but has never previously been isolated from 
 <italic>Mimosa</italic> in its invasive range regions. So, the 
 <italic>Mimosa</italic>-nodulation Rhizobium species in China might be also introduced together with their hosts, but they are not so adapted to the conditions in the invasive regions.
