<p>In the SPSS analysis and the principal component analysi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), the correlation of 
 <italic>Cupriavidus</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Rhizobium</italic> spp. with the infertile alkaline soil type (category I) and neutral soil (category II), and the accommodating of 
 <italic>Paraburkholderia</italic> spp. in more acidic soils (category III and IV) were consistent with the previous reports that have shown that 
 <italic>C. taiwanensis</italic> is abundant as a 
 <italic>Mimosa</italic> symbiont in neutral to basic pH soils (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), often with relatively high fertility (

 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Mishra et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Gehlot et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast to 
 <italic>Cupriavidus</italic>, 
 <italic>Paraburkholderia</italic> strains can tolerate acidic soils (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Stopnisek et al., 2014</xref>), and indeed become dominant symbionts with the compatible legumes; it was similar for rhizobia nodulating with mimosoid and papilionoid legumes (

 <italic>Mimosa</italic> symbionts in southern China (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001, â‰¤0.01). For example, although higher soil fertility and N concentration improved the competitive nodulation of 
 <italic>Paraburkholderia</italic> over 
 <italic>Cupriavidus</italic> and 
 <italic>Rhizobium</italic> on 
 <italic>Mimosa</italic> spp. in reduced N concentrations/low fertility growth media (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Elliott et al., 2009</xref>), this was not the case in the present study wherein the dominant symbionts in the alkaline-neutral soils (soil types I and II) were overwhelmingly 
 <italic>Cupriavidus</italic> regardless of their low fertility. The opposite was the case for the acidic soils wherein the 
 <italic>Paraburkholderia</italic> strains dominated even though the soils were relatively fertile.
