<p>The worldwide distribution of various symbionts isolated from invasive 
 <italic>Mimosa</italic> species may be the result of selection by soil characteristics and other ecological factors (

 <italic>P. mimosarum</italic> was more abundant in Yunnan; 
 <italic>P. phymatum</italic> was more in Guangdong and Guangxi; 
 <italic>Rhizobium</italic> stains were mostly from Hainan; and the minor group 
 <italic>P. caribensis</italic> was only isolated from 
 <italic>M. pudica</italic> plants grown in Guangdong and Guangxi. These geographic distributions implied an interaction among the plants, the rhizobial species, and the environment factors, as described for rhizobia associated with soybean (
