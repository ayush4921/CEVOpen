<p>In summary, 
 <italic>Cupriavidus</italic> strains are highly adaptable and competitive symbionts of the two 
 <italic>Mimosa</italic> species in an invasive context, particularly when soils are neutral-alkaline, but they even retain a high degree of competitiveness in soils less optimal for it (i.e., slightly acidic and with low levels of OM and N). The disparity between the dominance of 
 <italic>Cupariavidus</italic> in an invasive environment, and its sporadic occurrence in their native regions is still not clearly explained, but it could be related to the fact that most 
 <italic>Mimosa</italic> species are not capable of nodulating effectively with 
 <italic>C. taiwanensis</italic> (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Elliott et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">dos Reis et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, its preferred hosts, 
 <italic>M. pudica</italic> and 
 <italic>M. diplotricha</italic>, although common in lowland areas of the neotropics (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Barrett and Parker, 2005</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Mishra et al., 2012</xref>), are mainly restricted to disturbed sites (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Bontemps et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bara√∫na et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that the same soil factors which encouraging the invasiveness of its 
 <italic>Mimosa</italic> plants (fertile ground subject to anthropogenic disturbance) also created a niche which favoring 
 <italic>C. taiwanensis</italic> over its usual competitors for nodulation in its native region (i.e., 
 <italic>Paraburkholderia</italic> species).
