<p>On the other hand, the dominance of 
 <italic>Cupriavidus</italic> as a 
 <italic>Mimosa</italic> symbionts appears to be a phenomenon that occurs mainly in invasive ecosystems. For example, in some natural ecosystems, such as central Mexico (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Bontemps et al., 2016</xref>), the Indian Thar Desert (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Gehlot et al., 2013</xref>), and even in parts of central Brazil (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bara√∫na et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">de Castro Pires et al., 2018</xref>), where soils are neutral to alkaline, Alpha-rhizobia can be the dominant symbionts of the native/endemic 
 <italic>Mimosa</italic> species. Indeed, 
 <italic>Cupriavidus</italic> species are normally minor group or absent in their centers of origin (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Bontemps et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">dos Reis et al., 2010</xref>), 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">de Castro Pires et al., 2018</xref>). The exceptions come from Texas where a widespread species 
 <italic>M. asperata</italic> was nodulated only with 
 <italic>C. taiwanensis</italic>-like bacteria (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Andam et al., 2007</xref>), and from Uruguay in which native/endemic 
 <italic>Mimosa</italic> species grown in slightly acidic soils of a heavy metal mining area were exclusively nodulated with 
 <italic>C. necator</italic>- and 
 <italic>C. pinatubonensis</italic>-like bacteria with 
 <italic>nod</italic> genes divergent from 
 <italic>C. taiwanensis</italic> (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Platero et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, the Uruguayan native/endemic 
 <italic>Mimosa</italic> appeared to be incapable of nodulating effectively with 
 <italic>Paraburkholderia</italic> strains suggesting that they had co-evolved with their 
 <italic>Cupriavidus</italic> symbionts in a manner similar to that described for species in central Brazil and central Mexico with 
 <italic>Paraburkholderia</italic> and Alpha-rhizobia symbionts, respectively (
