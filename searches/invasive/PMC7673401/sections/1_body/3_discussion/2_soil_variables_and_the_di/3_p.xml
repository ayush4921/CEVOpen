<p>Taken together, 
 <italic>Cupriavidus</italic> spp. are the most common and competitive rhizobial type in southern China due to its ability to grow in the widest range of pH, soil nutrition/fertility, and soil moisture levels (from drought to flooding), and maybe also to its tolerance to heavy metals (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Klonowska et al., 2012</xref>). 
 <italic>C. taiwanensis</italic> was recognized as strong stress resistant bacteria able to survive and grow at phenol concentrations up to 900 mg/L (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2004</xref>). It is also particularly dominant in islands like Taiwan (

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Klonowska et al., 2012</xref>), and Hainan (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Certainly it is possible that the similar climate and soils in these islands have created habitats ideal for the two invasive 
 <italic>Mimosa</italic> species (
 <italic>M. pudica</italic>, 
 <italic>M. diplotricha</italic>), where the soils are also rich in P and K, and would favor 
 <italic>C. taiwanensis</italic> rather than (for instance) 
 <italic>Rhizobium</italic>.
