 <caption> Phylogenies of 16S rRNA gene and the concatenated 16S rRNA and five housekeeping genes ( atpD, recA, dnaK, gyrB, and glnA) in rhizobial strains isolated from nodules on invasive Mimosa spp. in southern China. The Maximum likelihood phylogenies are based on (A) 16S rRNA gene sequences (1320 bp); (B) concatenated 16S rRNA and five housekeeping gene sequences (3706 bp). </caption>
