  <p>Comparison of the distribution of four communities of rhizobial types associated with invasive 
   <italic>Mimosa</italic> species in southern China by principal component analysis of total N, available K, available P, precipitation and pH. The principal component one revealed correlations of available K with available P and pH. The principal component two is characterized by precipitation and total N and organic matter. Ellipses represent 90% confidence limits. The word in text box means each occupied sites percent and species constitute in different soil types.
