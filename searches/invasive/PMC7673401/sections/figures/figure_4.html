 <caption> Comparison of the distribution of four communities of rhizobial types associated with invasive Mimosa species in southern China by principal component analysis of total N, available K, available P, precipitation and pH. The principal component one revealed correlations of available K with available P and pH. The principal component two is characterized by precipitation and total N and organic matter. Ellipses represent 90% confidence limits. The word in text box means each occupied sites percent and species constitute in different soil types. </caption>
