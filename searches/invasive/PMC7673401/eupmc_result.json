    "In order to investigated diversity and geographic distribitution of rhizobia associated with invasive <i>Mimosa</i> species, <i>Mimosa</i> nodules and soils around the plants were sampled from five provinces in southern China. In total, 361 isolates were obtained from <i>Mimosa pudica</i> and <i>Mimosa diplotricha</i> in 25 locations. A multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) including 16S rRNA, <i>atpD</i>, <i>dnaK</i>, <i>glnA</i>, <i>gyrB</i>, and <i>recA</i> identified the isolates into eight genospecies corresponding to <i>Paraburkhleria mimosarum</i>, <i>Paraburkholderia phymatum</i>, <i>Paraburkholeria carbensis</i>, <i>Cupriavidus taiwanensis</i>, <i>Cupriavidus</i> sp., <i>Rhizobium altiplani</i>, <i>Rhizobium mesoamericanum</i>, and <i>Rhizobium etli</i>. The majority of the isolates were <i>Cupriavidus</i> (62.6%), followed by <i>Paraburkholderia</i> (33.5%) and <i>Rhizobium</i> (2.9%). <i>Cupriavidus</i> strains were more predominant in nodules of <i>M. diplotricha</i> (76.2) than in <i>M. pudica</i> (59.9%), and the distribution of <i>P. phymatum</i> in those two plant species was reverse (3.4:18.2%). Four symbiotypes were defined among the isolates based upon the phylogeny of <i>nodA</i>-<i>nifH</i> genes, represented by <i>P. mimosarum</i>, <i>P. phymatum</i>-<i>P. caribensis</i>, <i>Cupriavidus</i> spp., and <i>Rhizobium</i> spp. The species affiliation and the symbiotype division among the isolates demonstrated the multiple origins of <i>Mimosa</i> rhizobia in China: most were similar to those found in the original centers of <i>Mimosa</i> plants, but <i>Cupriavidus</i> sp. might have a local origin. The unbalanced distribution of symbionts between the two <i>Mimosa</i> species might be related to the soil pH, organic matter and available nitrogen; <i>Cupriavidus</i> spp. generally dominated most of the soils colonized by <i>Mimosa</i> in this study, but it had a particular preference for neutral-alkaline soils with low fertility whereas. While <i>Paraburkholderia</i> spp. preferred more acidic and fertile soils. The <i>Rhizobium</i> spp. tended to prefer neutral-acidic soils with high fertility soils."
