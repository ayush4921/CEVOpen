<p id="p0045">The seed density of the seed bank was assesesed through the seedling emergence techniques (
 <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">Baker, 1989</xref>). In brief, each sample was thoroughly mixed to confirm seed distribution well, also some materials such as rocks, woods, and leaves were removed. The soil was spread equally in rectangular perforated plastic trays (45 × 45 × 7 cm) lined with less than 2 cm in the depth of the sterilized sand substrate. The trays were arranged on the benches in a greenhouse, and water was added daily in the first month, then it was every three days for the two additional months. The number of germinated seedlings for each species was recorded weekly.
