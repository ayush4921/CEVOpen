<p id="p0060">The collected soil samples, under- and outside canopy, were physically and chemically analyzed. Moreover, fresh soil samples were collected in a moisture tin, and directly the soil moisture was determined by the weight loss method. Soil samples were air dried at room temperature till complete dryness and then sieved through a 2-mm sieve to remove any contaminants. The soil texture was determined according to 
 <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">Bouyoucos (1962)</xref>, while soil electrical conductivity (EC) and pH were determined in the soil solution (1:5) (
 <xref rid="b0305" ref-type="bibr">Rowell, 1994</xref>). The Cl and SO
 <sub>4</sub> were determined in the soil solution using the titration method, whereas Ca, Mg, Na, and K, were determined using a flame photometer according to 
 <xref rid="b0300" ref-type="bibr">Rhoades (1982)</xref>. Available nitrogen was determined by the Kjeldahl method as described by 
 <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">Bremner and Mulvaney (1982)</xref>, while available phosphorus was determined colorimetrically as described by 
 <xref rid="b0280" ref-type="bibr">Nelson and Sommers (1982)</xref>.
