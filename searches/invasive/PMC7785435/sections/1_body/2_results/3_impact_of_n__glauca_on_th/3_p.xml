<p id="p0105">When comparing the relative density among the SHFA1, SHFA2, and SHFA3 locations, the relative density of the plant species of the seed bank outside the canopy was higher than under the canopy of 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> in all locations (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). In SHFA1 location, 
 <italic>Euphorbia prostrata</italic>, 
 <italic>Polypogon viridis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Pulicaria arabica</italic> showed more abundance outside the canopy of 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic>, while in SHFA2, 
 <italic>Euphorbia prostrata</italic>, 
 <italic>Eragrostis papposa</italic>, and 
 <italic>Pulicaria undulata</italic> attained higher density outside canopy. In SHFA3, the 
 <italic>Eragrostis papposa</italic> showed more abundance under canopy of 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic>, while 
 <italic>Chenopodium carinatum</italic> and 
 <italic>Cenchrus ciliaris</italic> attained higher abundance outside canopy compared to under canopy (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). By pooling the data of all stands within each location, it was clear that the most affected location was RDF, followed by WHT, and finally, SHFA, where 8, 6, and 4 species were recorded only in the seed bank outside the canopy of the investigated 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> shrubs in RDF, WHT, and SHFA, respectively. While 2, 3, and 4 species were recorded only under canopy of 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> in RDF, WHT, and SHFA, respectively.
