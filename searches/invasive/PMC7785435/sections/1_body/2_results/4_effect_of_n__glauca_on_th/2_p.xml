<p id="p0110">The presence of 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> in all studied locations resulted in low species richness and evenness (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The species richness and evenness were more affected by the canopy of 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> in WHT1 location, and this location attained RII values of −0.56 and −0.66, respectively (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). In SHFA1 location, the RII values of the species richness and evenness were −0.53 and −0.55, respectively. While in RDF it showed RII values of −0.26 and −0.46, respectively.
