<p id="p0095">The chorotype analysis of the recorded species from the seed bank revealed that 23.8% of the species were monoregional, and the Saharo-Arabian element was the most represented chorotype. On the other side, 21.4% of the recorded species were Biregional, where Saharo-Arabian + Sudano-Zambezian element was the most recorded chorotype. Also, 21.4% of the recorded species were pluriregional, where the most chorotype were Mediterranean + Saharo-Arabian + Irano-Turanian element. Additionally, the phytogeographical categories included cosmopolitan, pantropical, palaeotropical, and Neotropical (
