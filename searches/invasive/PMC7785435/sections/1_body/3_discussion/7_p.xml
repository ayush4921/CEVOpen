<p id="p0150">The seeds of 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> represent 60.4% of the seed bank in the study area, which is lower than those reported for 
 <italic>Juniperus procera</italic> (65.7%) in Ridah Reserve, the southwestern region of Saudi Arabia (
 <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">El-Juhany et al., 2008</xref>). On the other hand, the relative density of the understory plant species showed substantial variations among the studied locations. The relative densities of the plant species were higher outside the canopy of 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> in all locations. Overall, the invaded locations can be arranged according to the following sequence: RDF &gt; WHT &gt; SHFA. This observation could be attributed to the degree of the anthropogenic activity or the elevation. The disturbance, climate, and elevation have been reported as important factors for the distribution of the invasive species (
