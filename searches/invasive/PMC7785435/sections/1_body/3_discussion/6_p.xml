<p id="p0145">The chorological analysis of the floristic data revealed the dominance of cosmopolitan species, Saharo-Arabian elements and Sudano-Zambezian. These results may indicate the wide ecologic amplitude and active transport in our study area (

There are many interpretations of how these species enter the study areas, for example, long-term climate changes, through human activities and animal movements, especially birds that disperse seeds on a large scale. The Arabian Desert climate supports many Sudanian species as a result of the hot climate, but its extremely dry is inconsistent with the establishment of such many plant species in the study area (
