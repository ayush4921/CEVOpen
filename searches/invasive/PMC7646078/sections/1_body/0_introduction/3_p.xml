<p id="Par30">Tiedeken et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] elaborating further on this subject concluded that feeding on IAS might drive the exposure of native pollinators to various levels of toxic phytochemicals. Among nectarâ€™s secondary metabolites, alkaloids consist a clear and identifiable target for the attribution of nectar toxicity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Alkaloids are generally acknowledged as the cutting edge of plants defence mechanisms deterring herbivores from damaging plant tissues [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], in their effort to describe the phenomenon of natural products introduction by IAS in marine ecosystems proposed the term Alien Bio-Molecules [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], in order to distinguish them by other xenobiotics of human origin, pioneering thus the study of invasive phytochemicals ecological implications.
