<p id="Par32">While the study of 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> flowers alkaloid content is aiming to delineate the availability of invasive molecules to indigenous pollinators communities, the use of honeybees (
 <italic>Apis melifera)</italic> fed by flowers extracts, standardised on the prevailing alkaloid concentration, aspires to investigate any potential adverse effect on bees survival after exposure. To elucidate this plantâ€“insect interaction framework, an analytical method was developed, validated and applied to investigate alkaloids levels in plant extracts and honeybees, devoting specific focus on the 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> alkaloid content and its fate upon consumption by honeybees.
