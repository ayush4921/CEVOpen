<p id="Par29">In Europe alone, herbal IAS account to 5.789 
 <italic>taxa</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], applying pressures that have been identified as competition events, pathogens introduction and transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and pollinators decline [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This last pressure may be explained by the consideration of herbal IAS as a significant feed resource, providing pollinators with both nectar and pollen [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The consumption of IAS nectar is a problem because of its secondary metabolites content, which has been found to present toxic effects to pollinators [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In the same context, and in relation to food commodities, compounds such as alkaloids are controlled under the maximum residue limits (MRLs) Regulation 396/2005 and its respective amendments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. MRLs are established for some of them, but not in apiculture matrices. Hence, in cases of positives’ detection, the general default MRL of 0.01 mg/kg can be applied.
