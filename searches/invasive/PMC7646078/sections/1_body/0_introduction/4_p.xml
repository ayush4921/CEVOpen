<p id="Par31">The present study is aiming to ameliorate these previous research results on the adverse effects of invasive molecules, through the investigation of their ecosystem availability. Consequently, 
 <italic>Nicotiana glauca</italic> Graham (
 <italic>N. glauca</italic>, Solanaceae), whose nectar contains nicotine like alkaloids, was selected as a focal point. 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> is a fast-growing shrub or small tree native to South America that has been introduced in North America, Europe, and Asia, consisting thus an IAS of global expansion [

 <italic>N. glauca</italic> in its native range [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], bees and other insects have been observed to visit its flowers and impale the base of the corolla to access its nectar (Fig.Â
