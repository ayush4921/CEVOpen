<p id="Par58">For the analytical methods validation, the dried organic extracts were fortified with known amount of the mix solution of the alkaloids and scopoletin. The outcomes of validation study, presented for the methanolic extract in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, showed that all analytical figures of merit were acceptable. Recoveries, for all analytes, for the three studied concentration levels varied from 75 to 93%, with satisfactory RSD% values (≤ 15%). Similar values, (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Tables S2, S3), were obtained for the other two extracts and in the same magnitude. Repeatability (intra-day precision) and inter-day precision were acceptable as demonstrated by the RSD% values that were below 10.5%. More specifically, recoveries for all compounds varied from 74 to 100%, in the three concentration levels studied, with RSD% values &lt; 11%. LODs for the plant extracts were calculated as described above and varied from 10 to 26 ng/g extract, while LOQs fluctuated from 30 to 79 ng/g extract. Concerning honeybees an LOQ (for all analytes) was established at 40 ng/g bee bw. The latter was fit for the purpose of the study and was supported by acceptable precision and accuracy, as indicated in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4.
