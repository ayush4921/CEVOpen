<p id="Par59">One often unanticipated etiology of low quality analytical results is the matrix interference. Even though the MS/MS technique is considered less susceptible than other analytical techniques and detectors (such as simple MS, or UV detector), still matrix effect is vastly reported. In this context, the assessment of matrix effects demonstrated a slight enhancement of the signal of the analytes, except for scopoletin (slight suppression), overall being characterized as not significant. Non-significant was also the ME for all analytes using the QuEChERS extraction of chemicals from bees (see ME values in Additional file

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). Separation of analytes under RP chromatography conditions was not successful especially for anatabine and nicotine. In particular, the resolution of their isomers could not be evidenced under such conditions (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2). Even though the MS/MS environment does not require substantial resolution among analytes in multianalytes methods, it was decided to enhance the separation of the compounds and their isomers, optimizing the peak shape. The latter was accomplished by utilizing hydrophilic interaction chromatography conditions [
