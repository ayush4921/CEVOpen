<p id="Par62">All 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> extracts had a significant effect on bees’ mortality compared to control (Bonferroni test: p &lt; 0.05), presenting similar mortality rates between 16 and 18%, with the exception of methanol extract’s feeding solution containing anabasine at 20 μg/mL, which presented an augmented mortality rate by 23% in the 4th day. Both feeding treatment and post treatment period had a significant effect on bees mortality F = 21.08; df = 4, 10; p &lt; 0.001); F = 104.08; df = 8, 20; p &lt; 0.001). No significant interaction between the two factors was found (F = 0.27; df = 8, 20; p = 0.97).
