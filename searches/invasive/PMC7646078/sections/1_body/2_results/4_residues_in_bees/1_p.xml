<p id="Par63">Dead bees were analyzed for the presence of the four constituents detected in the respective extracts (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> for results). Anabasine was detected in dead bees from all the feeding solutions, confirming its uptake from the plant extracts. In specific, anabasine was found on an average concentration of 9.2 ng per bee (equivalent to 92 ng/g 
 <sub>bee bw</sub>), 5.1 ng per bee, 4.7 ng per bee, and 4.3 ng per bee in methanol extract 20 μg/mL, methanol, dichloromethane and hexane extract 10 μg/mL respectively (an indicative chromatogram is presented in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5). Scopoletin traces were detected in dead bees from feeding solutions containing it. These residual invasive molecules quantities originated exclusively from the feeding solutions content.
