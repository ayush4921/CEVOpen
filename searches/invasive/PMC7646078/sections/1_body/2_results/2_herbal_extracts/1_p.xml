<p id="Par60">The qualitative analyses of the three 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> extracts included as target molecules the alkaloids anabasine, anatabine, nicotine, nornicotine, cotinine, myosmine, and the coumarin scopoletin (for MRM transitions and retention times see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3Aâ€“G). The results presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, indicated as more diverse the methanolic extract, which contained anabasine, anatabine, nornicotine and scopoletin, while dichloromethane extract proved to contain only anabasine and anatabine, and hexane extract only anabasine. The quantitative analysis that was performed in the three 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> extracts delineated the concentrations of anabasine, anatabine, scopoletin and nornicotine. The methanolic extract exhibited the highest concentrations of all constituents, with prevailing compound anabasine (for respective chromatogram see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S4), and lower levels of anatabine, scopoletin, and nornicotine. Dichloromethane and hexane extracts presented a much lower and descending concentration of anabasine, respectively. Nornicotine is a demethylation product of nicotine that is reported to occur in Nicotiana species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and was evidenced in the methanolic extract. Similarly, scopoletin, which has been reported as an active constituent of 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] was quantified as well. On the other hand, nicotine, myosmine, and cotinine were not detected in any of the extracts.
