<p id="Par57">To analyze the differences of 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> extracts on the bee mortality among the different observation days, repeated measures ANOVA (RM-ANOVA) were performed. The percentage mortalities were transformed to arcsine square-root values prior to analysis in order to satisfy assumptions of the parametric analysis. When RM-ANOVA indicated a significant difference among treatments, Bonferroni test was used to identify the differences between treatments and control. Analyses were performed using the statistical package SPSS 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, U.S.A.).
