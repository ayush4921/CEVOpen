<p id="Par47">The precision of the chromatographic method was expressed as the relative standard deviation, RSD % of the repeatability (intra-day) and intermediate precision (inter-day) analyses (n = 3) over the three days studied, after injection of quality control samples, fortified at 200 ng/g with appropriate volume of the analytes mix solution. Intra-day, and inter-day precision were considered acceptable when RSD% were &lt; 20%.</p>
