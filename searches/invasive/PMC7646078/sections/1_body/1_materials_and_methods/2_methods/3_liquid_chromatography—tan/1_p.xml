<p id="Par41">An Agilent Technologies 6410 Triple Quad LC/MS system was used, equipped with a Nitrogen Generator (NitroFlowLab). Optimum LC separation condition, using HILIC conditions described in the literature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] were embraced with the flow rate modified to 0.4 mL/min, working under isocratic conditions. Thus, the mobile phase was composed of a mixture of acetonitrile and water (85:15, v/v) containing 5 mmol/L ammonium acetate (pH 5). The sample injection volume was 10 μL. Separation occurred on a HILIC column (Agilent, Zorbax HILIC Plus, Narrow Bore RR, 2.1 × 100 mm, 3.5 μm).
