<p id="Par42">Reversed phase (RP) separation was achieved after injecting 10 μL of sample on a RP column (ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C18 Agilent, 2.1 × 150 mm, 3.5 μm) using a gradient system consisting of (A) Water with 5 mM ammonium formate, 0.1% formic acid, and (B) Methanol with 5 mM ammonium formate, 0.1% formic acid. The flow rate was set at 0.3 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup> and the column gradient program consisted of: linear ramping from 0 to 100% B within 10, 10–15 min 100% B. Then gradient system returned from 15–20 min, to initial conditions (100% A), where it stayed for additional 5 min to equilibrate. The mass spectrometer was operated in Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) mode with positive Electron Spray Ionization, and both quadrupoles were set at unit mass resolution. Nitrogen was used as nebulizer and collision gas. The software used for instrument control was Agilent Mass Hunter data acquisition Triple Quad B.01.04 software and for data processing Agilent MassHunter Workstation Qualitative Analysis B.01.04 software.
