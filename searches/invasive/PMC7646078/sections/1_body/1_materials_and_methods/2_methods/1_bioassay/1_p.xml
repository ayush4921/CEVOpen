<p id="Par38">Bees feeding bioassay was conducted in groups of 40–50 individuals, using three replicates per treatment (see treatments below). The groups of 40–50 bees were placed in wire-screened plastic holding-cages (30 × 30 × 30cm) and provided with 50% (w/v) sucrose solution and water for 24 h in order to acclimatize to laboratory conditions. Bees were deprived of food for 5 h, before the administration of 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> extracts. Then, the appropriate solutions (solutions are presented below) of 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> extracts were prepared on with sucrose and water, poured into small plates (10 cm in diameter), and provided to bees.One plate containing 20 mL of the appropriate solution of 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> extracts was placed into each cage except the control were bees fed with 20 mL 50% (w/v) sucrose solution. Treated food remained in the cages for 24 h. Then, all treated plates were replaced by new plates that contained only sucrose solutions. For each treatment, three replicates of 40–50 bees were used.
