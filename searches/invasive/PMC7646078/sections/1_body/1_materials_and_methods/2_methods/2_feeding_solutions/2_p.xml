<p id="Par40">In addition to these three feeding solutions (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1 for components’ concentration in the extracts), another methanolic solution standardised to 20 μg/mL of anabasine (methanol extract 20 μg/mL) was prepared also accompanied by the control feeding solution containing only sucrose (50%, w/v). The feeding solutions were administered in a constant dose of 20 mL per cage, which remained in the cages for 24 h and then were replaced by 50% (w/v) sucrose solutions. Honeybees’ mortality was assessed in 0, 4 and 8 days post-treatment.
