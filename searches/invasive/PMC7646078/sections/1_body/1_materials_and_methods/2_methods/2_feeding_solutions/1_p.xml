<p id="Par39">After determining the composition of each dry extract, three stock solutions were prepared through the addition of a 50% (w/v) sucrose solution (in water) in each dry extract (devoid of organic solvent residues) benefiting from the high-water solubility of anabasine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and anatabine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and the moderate solubility of nornicotine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and scopoletin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Then, by appropriate dilution with the addition of 50% (w/v) sucrose solution in for each feeding solution to present a constant concentration of 10 μg/mL of anabasine. The rationale behind the selection of this concentration stems from a pertinent study on the feeding of foraging honeybees to secondary molecules that mimic floral nectar [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In this study, bees were dissuaded by such concentration of anabasine.
