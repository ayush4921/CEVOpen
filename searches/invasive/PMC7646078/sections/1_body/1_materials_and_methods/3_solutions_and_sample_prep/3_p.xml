<p id="Par45">The honeybees’ sample preparation was based on a modified “quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe” (QuEChERS) protocol [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. More specifically, 1 g of honeybees (approximately 10–15 dead individuals) was mixed with water (2 mL) using a glass rod, and acetonitrile was added (7 mL). The mixture was homogenized for 4 min (Ultra Turax homogenizer, 20,000 rpm) and then transferred to a falcon tube containing MgSO
 <sub>4</sub> (1 g), and sodium acetate (0.2 g). The resulting mixture was shaken for 1 min, and vortex-mixed for 1 min. After centrifugation at 4000 rpm and 10 °C for 5 min, the upper organic phase was transferred to a separate falcon tube containing MgSO
 <sub>4</sub> (500 mg), PSA (50 mg), and C18 endcapped (25 mg). After shaking, and vortex-mixing for total 2 min, the supernatant solution was decanted and evaporated to dryness using a nitrogen stream. The dry extract was reconstituted with acetonitrile (1 mL), filtered, and injected to the LC–ESI–MS/MS system.
