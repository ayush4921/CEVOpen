<p id="Par43">Stock solutions of each analytical standard were prepared at 1000 μg/mL in methanol. Subsequently, an intermediate stock solution was prepared at 10 μg/mL containing all analytes. The latter was used to prepare the working solutions used for calibration purposes. This approach was incorporated for the spiking of both plant and honeybees’ extracts. All working solutions were prepared on a daily basis, while stock solutions were kept stored at −18 °C.</p>
