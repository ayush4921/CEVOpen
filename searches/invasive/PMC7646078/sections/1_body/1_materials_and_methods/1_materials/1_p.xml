<p id="Par35">Herbal material consisted of 
 <italic>Nicotiana glauca</italic> Graham flowers –including calyx–, which were collected from Paros island, Greece (37°07′01″ N, 25°14′08″ E), on August 9, 2015. Herbal material was dried naturally and weighted to 67 g. The dried herbal material was finely grinded and subjected to successive extraction with n-hexane, dichloromethane, and methanol. In specific each extract was obtained by the application of 1.5 L of solvent divided into three repetitions (0.5 L each) of three days duration each. The extracts were condensed through vacuum and heat-assisted evaporation (Büchi Rotavapor R-210 equipped with Büchi vacuum pump V-700, Vacuum controller V-850, and Julabo F12 cooling unit), and subsequently subjected to freeze-drying (Scientz-18 N, Freeze dryer). The yield of each solvent’s extract (in g per 100 g of dried flowers) were as follows: (a) hexane, 4.2 (b) dichloromethane, 1.8, and (c) MeOH, 12.2.
