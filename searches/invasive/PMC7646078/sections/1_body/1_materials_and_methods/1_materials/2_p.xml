<p id="Par36">A beehive of 
 <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> ssp. cecropia, a 
 <italic>taxon</italic> originating in southern Greece, was used as pollinator for the study. The apiary consisted from 25 standard Langstroth hives with one hive-body containing 10 frames. The hives were not subjected in chemicals treatment for the control of pests and diseases. The bees were recruited from two brood frames of a single hive; young worker bees (3–13 days old “nurse bees”) were captured from the hive, put into a plastic box and transferred to the laboratory. In addition, dead bees were obtained from the reservoir of routine honeybee samples that Benaki Phytopathological Institute receives for pesticide residue analysis and assessment of Varroa and Nosema infestation and were utilized as control samples. These samples were devoid of pesticide residues and the herein targeted compounds.
