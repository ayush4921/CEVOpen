<p id="Par71">To estimate the bee’s daily alkaloid consumption was considered the maximum daily nectar consumption of 128 mg/bee for forager honeybees [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and the density of the 50% w/v sucrose aqueous solution used (1.23 g/mL, 20 °C). Based on these assumptions the dose of anabasine in which a single honeybee was exposed within the 24 h-feeding period is determined at 1.04 μg/bee in feeding solution concentration of 10 μg/mL, and at 2.08 μg/bee in feeding solution concentration of 20 μg/mL. Minor discrepancies in the detected residues, among the three feeding solutions, might indicate differential behaviour of bees as regard the plant extract uptake during experimentation and/or differential metabolism within individual bees. The differences in mean measured concentrations in bees compared to the external doses are expected, considering that the internal dose is dependent on several factors. Among them, the most pivotal is the toxicant’s half-life (t
 <sub>1/2</sub>.), also mentioned in the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) guidance document on risk assessment on bees [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. More specifically, once an animal stops to be exposed to the toxicant, the anticipated time for its virtual elimination from the animal’s body is five-times its t
 <sub>1/2</sub> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Anabasine shares similar t
 <sub>1/2</sub> with nicotine (2–3 h in plasma) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], which along with the sampling time and the low bioaccumulation potential of the polar anabasine (and related alkaloids) can justify the low concentrations detected. The attribution of the residual quantities in individual bees indicates the possibility of the potential transfer of these residues inside the beehive (see paragraph below).
