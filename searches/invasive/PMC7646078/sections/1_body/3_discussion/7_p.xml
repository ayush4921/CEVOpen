<p id="Par72">Considering the sample preparation for alkaloids extraction from bees, it was based on two approaches: (a) a methanolic and/or ethyl acetate direct extraction of alkaloids, using only a reconstitution (for ethyl acetate) and a drying step prior to chemical analysis and, (b) a modified QuEChERS protocol. The consideration of the QuEChERS methodology was attempted considering its extensive use in pesticides and organic contaminants sample preparation (and consequent analysis), and the possible introduction of alkaloids in such multiresidue schemes (nicotine possesses insecticidal properties). Specialized methods for alkaloids extraction exist, taking advantage of the acidobasic features and differences of various alkaloids solubility. Nevertheless, they were not implemented due to the more tedious sample preparation. Other laboratory trials (data not shown) on the optimization of QuEChERS protocol were attempted, especially on the pH adjustment (basic using NH
 <sub>3</sub> or NaOH, pH ~ 9 to 10 on the first step, and addition of formic acid solution to reach a pH ~ 5 at the last step). Since the results were comparable to the sodium acetate standard procedure, we selected the latter as the final choice. In the end, both approaches (direct organic solvent and QuEChERS extraction) were efficient on recovering the targeted compounds as demonstrated by analytical method performance, with QuEChERS protocol, yielding cleaner extracts, therefore it was selected and fully validated. Alkaloids have been adequately extracted using QuEChERS from tea [
