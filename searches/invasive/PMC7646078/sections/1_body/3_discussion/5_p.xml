<p id="Par70">Singaravelan et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] investigating the effects of free-flying bees’ exposure to secondary compounds that mimic floral nectars reported that anabasine was shown to deter honeybees, with the more profound effect being observed at the 25 μg/mL dose. In an ensuing study though delineating the nicotine impacts on honeybees, it was stressed that symptoms and mortality need to be examined in the context of the overall hygiene and bee health status [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Even though previous research results provide advocacy for present findings, are not directly comparable regarding the parameters examined herein, dictating that the role of anabasine in bees mortality needs to be investigated further through experimentation detailing the dose–response phenomena in a prolonged time frame. Nevertheless, present findings report for the first time the alkaloid content of
