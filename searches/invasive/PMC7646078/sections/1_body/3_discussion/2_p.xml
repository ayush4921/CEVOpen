<p id="Par67">It must be noted that honeybees’ foraging in 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> requires the consumption of herbal tissue to reach the flower’s nectar, as evidenced by our group and depicted by Ollerton et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It is also noteworthy that damaging of petals-flowers by honeybees was evidenced (see also a respective photo taken during bees visiting 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> in Greece, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), a fact known to elicit the alkaloidal response in 
 <italic>Nicotiana</italic> spp. manifesting increase in concentrations in flowers and nectar. In addition, and as mentioned by Adler and colleagues, leaf alkaloid levels in 
 <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> are higher than the nectar alkaloid levels (mg/g compared to μg/g, respectively) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], which can be hypothesized for 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> accordingly. Research findings concerning alkaloid levels in other species, such as lupin (
 <italic>Lupinus</italic> L. spp.), demonstrated higher levels of alkaloids in inflorescences, with respect to leaves, and stems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Similarly, Gosselin et al. reported that alkaloids of toxic plant 
 <italic>Aconitum septentrionale</italic> (Ranunculaceae) display lower concentrations in nectar compared to leaves and flowers. Hence, it cannot be excluded that bees can potentially be exposed to higher alkaloids’ concentrations than the ones present in non-damaged flowers or even nectar, which to a degree, can justify the 10 μg/mL concentration used in the assay. Such approach can also compromise the absence of nectar in testing and bridge the difference in estimated exposure and exposure dose(s) administered.
