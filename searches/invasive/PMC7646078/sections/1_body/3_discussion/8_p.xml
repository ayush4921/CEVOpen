<p id="Par73">With regard to the hydrophilic stationary phase, it encourages partition of the analytes (in this case, the alkaloids and scopoletin) in the stationary water phase that is formed within the column. In addition, the preliminary comparison of RP with HILIC mode showed that the latter exhibited higher sensitivity for all analytes, possibly due to easier desolvation of the mobile phase (contained less water than the respective of RP) during the electrospray ionization.</p>
