<p id="Par69">The increased mortality provoked by the administration of the methanol extract at 20 μg/mL, indicates that this observation might be connected to the presence of anabasine, which is a known insect control agent [

In this context, such compounds although prevalent, are not expected to provoke substantial effects on bees, not omitting of course the combined effects that are to a large extent underexplored. For example, recent work on the beneficial role of such components showed that the terpenes of various parts of thyme inhibited the growth of bee disease associated microbes [
