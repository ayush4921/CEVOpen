<p id="Par76">Similarly, and with regard to pyridine alkaloids, such as nicotine and anabasine, none specific MRL is defined in honey. Therefore the general default MRL of 0.01 mg/kg can be regarded. Consequently, from the results of the presented study and the detection of anabasine in bees it can be assumed that the beehive might get contaminated from these alkaloids, and residues can be transferred to the honey produce and the food chain. Nevertheless, EFSA states that MRL of nicotine in different commodities ranging from 0.3–4 mg/kg, is not risk for consumers [
