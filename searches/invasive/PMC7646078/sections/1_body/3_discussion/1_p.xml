<p id="Par66">The active ingredient of the feeding solution was the flower extract of 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic>. The reason behind this choice over the nectar extract is related to the foraging habits of the honeybees on 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> flowers. In specific as clearly stated by Ollerton et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] nectar robbers pierce the corolla, or make use of previous holes, and honeybees are totally capable to cut a hole in the corolla with their mandibles. The 10 μg/mL concentration was used as a focal point of our study. Such concentration was also assessed in feeding responses as presented by Singaravelan et al. (in artificial nectar) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and is approximately double the mean concentration in nectar reported by Tadmor-Melamed et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].
