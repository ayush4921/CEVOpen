<p id="Par68">Interestingly, Pashalidou and colleagues reported that bumblebees in the scarcity of pollen, damage plant leaves stimulating flower production [

 <italic>N. glauca</italic>, can further damage its leaves and flowers, which might lead to augmented alkaloids concentration. Nevertheless, it was not the case in this work due to the time of the sampling (
 <italic>N. gla</italic>u
