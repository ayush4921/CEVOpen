      "Climate change and invasive alien species threaten biodiversity. High temperature is a worrying ecological factor. Most responses of invasive plants aimed at coping with adversity are focused on the physiological level. To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the response of an invasive plant (<i>Sphagneticola trilobata</i> L.) to high temperature, using a native species (<i>Sphagneticola calendulacea</i> L.) as the control, relevant indicators, including photosynthetic pigments, gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, the antioxidant system, and related enzyme-coding genes were measured. The results showed that the leaves of <i>S. calendulacea</i> turned yellow, photosynthetic pigment content (Chl <i>a</i>, Chl <i>b</i>, Car, Chl) decreased, gas exchange (P<sub>n</sub>) and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters (F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub>, Φ<sub>PSII</sub>) decreased under high temperature. It was also found that high temperature caused photoinhibition and a large amount of ROS accumulated, resulting in an increase in MDA and relative conductivity. Antioxidant enzymes (including SOD, POD, CAT, and APX) and antioxidants (including flavonoids, total phenols, and carotenoids) were decreased. The qPCR results further showed that the expression of the <i>PsbP</i>, <i>PsbA,</i> and <i>RubiscoL</i>, <i>SOD</i>, <i>POD</i>, <i>CAT</i>, and <i>APX</i> genes was downregulated, which was consistent with the results of physiological data. Otherwise, the resistance of <i>S. trilobata</i> to high temperature was better than that of <i>S. calendulacea</i>, which made it a superior plant in the invasion area. These results further indicated that the gradual warming of global temperature will greatly accelerate the invasion area of <i>S. trilobata</i>."

      "Numerous studies have documented changes in the seasonal timing of organisms' growth and reproduction in response to climate warming. These changes correlate with documented changes in species' abundance, but mechanisms linking these trends remain elusive. We investigated the joint demographic effects of advanced reproductive phenology and warming on a globally invasive plant (Carduus nutans) in a field experiment, documenting a substantial shift toward completion of the life cycle at younger ages. Demographic modeling projected 71% of warmed individuals flower as annuals, compared to 61% under current conditions. As this species only reproduces once, this represents a major acceleration of the life cycle. We project a 15% increase in this invader's population growth rate. We show that rising temperatures accelerate this invasive species' population growth by increasing the average size of reproducing individuals; increasing the proportion of individuals that survive to reproduce; and increasing the fraction that reproduce as annuals. Major increases in population growth in this, and potentially many other, invasive species will threaten food security and require careful planning to avoid significant environmental and economic impacts."

      "Plant-fungal associations are frequently key drivers of plant invasion success. Foliar fungi can benefit their invasive hosts by enhancing growth promotion, disease resistance and environmental stress tolerance. However, the roles of foliar fungi may vary when a given invasive plant faces different stresses. In this study, we designed three independent experiments to evaluate the effects of a foliar fungus, <i>Colletotrichum</i> sp., on the growth performance of the invasive plant <i>Ageratina adenophora</i> under different soil conditions, as well as the responses of <i>A. adenophora</i> to the foliar fungal pathogen <i>Diaporthe helianthi</i> and to herbivory. We found that the soil type was the most influential factor for the growth of <i>A. adenophora</i>. The role of the foliar fungus <i>Colletotrichum</i> sp. varied in the different soil types but generally adversely affected leaf development in <i>A. adenophora</i>. <i>Colletotrichum</i> sp. may be a weak latent foliar pathogen that can enhance the pathogenicity of <i>D. helianthi</i> on leaves of <i>A. adenophora</i> and marginally reduce signs of herbivory by natural insects in the wild on <i>A. adenophora</i> seedlings. In general, the benefits of the foliar fungus <i>Colletotrichum</i> to the fitness of <i>A. adenophora</i> are not significant in the context of this experimental design. However, our data highlight the need to consider both aboveground and belowground biota in different soil habitats when evaluating the effects of foliar fungi."

      "Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) of plants continue to devastate ecosystems and livelihoods worldwide. Effective management requires surveillance to detect epidemics at an early stage. However, despite the increasing use of risk-based surveillance programs in plant health, it remains unclear how best to target surveillance resources to achieve this. We combine a spatially explicit model of pathogen entry and spread with a statistical model of detection and use a stochastic optimisation routine to identify which arrangement of surveillance sites maximises the probability of detecting an invading epidemic. Our approach reveals that it is not always optimal to target the highest-risk sites and that the optimal strategy differs depending on not only patterns of pathogen entry and spread but also the choice of detection method. That is, we find that spatial correlation in risk can make it suboptimal to focus solely on the highest-risk sites, meaning that it is best to avoid 'putting all your eggs in one basket'. However, this depends on an interplay with other factors, such as the sensitivity of available detection methods. Using the economically important arboreal disease huanglongbing (HLB), we demonstrate how our approach leads to a significant performance gain and cost saving in comparison with conventional methods to targeted surveillance."

      "From noble beginnings as a prospective forage, polyploid Sorghum halepense ('Johnsongrass') is both an invasive species and one of the world's worst agricultural weeds. Formed by S. bicolor x S. propinquum hybridization, we show S. halepense to have S. bicolor-enriched allele composition and striking mutations in 5,957 genes that differentiate it from representatives of its progenitor species and an outgroup. The spread of S. halepense may have been facilitated by introgression from closely-related cultivated sorghum near genetic loci affecting rhizome development, seed size, and levels of lutein, a photochemical protectant and abscisic acid precursor. Rhizomes, subterranean stems that store carbohydrates and spawn clonal propagules, have growth correlated with reproductive rather than other vegetative tissues, and increase survival of both temperate cold seasons and tropical dry seasons. Rhizomes of S. halepense are more extensive than those of its rhizomatous progenitor S. propinquum, with gene expression including many alleles from its non-rhizomatous S. bicolor progenitor. The first surviving polyploid in its lineage in ∼96 million years, its post-Columbian spread across six continents carried rich genetic diversity that in the United States has facilitated transition from agricultural to non-agricultural niches. Projected to spread another 200-600 km northward in the coming century, despite its drawbacks S. halepense may offer novel alleles and traits of value to improvement of sorghum."

      "Ecological forecasts of the extent and impacts of invasive species can inform conservation management decisions. Such forecasts are hampered by ecological uncertainties associated with non-analog conditions resulting from the introduction of an invader to an ecosystem. We developed a state-and-transition simulation model tied to a fire behavior model to simulate the spread of buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliaris) in Saguaro National Park, AZ, USA over a 30-year period. The simulation models forecast the potential extent and impact of a buffelgrass invasion including size and frequency of fire events and displacement of saguaro cacti and other native species. Using simulation models allowed us to evaluate how model uncertainties affected forecasted landscape outcomes. We compared scenarios covering a range of parameter uncertainties including model initialization (landscape susceptibility to invasion) and expert-identified ecological uncertainties (buffelgrass patch infill rates and precipitation). Our simulations showed substantial differences in the amount of buffelgrass on the landscape and the size and frequency of fires for dry years with slow patch infill scenarios compared to wet years with fast patch infill scenarios. We identified uncertainty in buffelgrass patch infill rates as a key area for research to improve forecasts. Our approach could be used to investigate novel processes in other invaded systems."

      "Biological control is a popular tool for invasive species management, but its success in nature is difficult to predict. One risk is that invasive plants, which may have adapted to lower herbivore pressure in the introduced range, could rapidly evolve defences upon re-association with their biocontrol agent(s). Previous studies have demonstrated that populations of the invasive plant purple loosestrife (<i>Lythrum salicaria</i>) exposed to biocontrol exhibit traits consistent with the rapid evolution of defence. However, to date, no one has tested this hypothesis under field-natural levels of herbivory. Using seed from 17 populations of purple loosestrife growing in eastern Canada, that varied in their history of exposure to their biocontrol agent, the leaf beetle <i>Neogalerucella</i> spp., we transplanted 1,088 seedlings from 136 maternal families into a common garden under ambient herbivory. Over the following three and half years, we assessed plant performance in the face of biocontrol by measuring early-season plant size, defoliation, flowering, and season-end biomass. We discovered that a population history with biocontrol explained little variation in herbivory or plant performance, suggesting that adaptation is not hindering biocontrol effectiveness. Instead, plant size, subsequent defoliation, and spatio-temporal variables were the main predictors of plant growth and flowering during the study. The high individual variability we observed in plant performance underscores that flexible strategies of allocation and phenology are important contributors to the persistence of invasive plants. Our findings suggest that plant adaptation to biocontrol is unlikely to be a strong impediment to biological control in this species, however, the high survival and variable defoliation of plants in our study also indicate that biocontrol alone is unlikely to result in significant population decline. We recommend that the application of multiple forms of control simultaneously (e.g. thinning plus biocontrol) could help to prevent the existence of refuges of large, reproductive individuals."

      "<i>Bromus tectorum</i> (cheatgrass) has successfully invaded and established throughout the western United States. <i>Bromus tectorum</i> grows early in the season and this early growth allows <i>B. tectorum</i> to outcompete native species, which has led to dramatic shifts in ecosystem function and plant community composition after <i>B. tectorum</i> invades. If the phenology of native species is unable to track changing climate as effectively as <i>B. tectorum</i>'s phenology then climate change may facilitate further invasion. To better understand how <i>B. tectorum</i> phenology will respond to future climate, we tracked the timing of <i>B. tectorum</i> germination, flowering, and senescence over a decade in three <i>in situ</i> climate manipulation experiments with treatments that increased temperatures (2°C and 4°C above ambient), altered precipitation regimes, or applied a combination of each. Linear mixed-effects models were used to analyze treatment effects on the timing of germination, flowering, senescence, and on the length of the vegetative growing season (time from germination to flowering) in each experiment. Altered precipitation treatments were only applied in early years of the study and neither precipitation treatments nor the treatments' legacies significantly affected <i>B. tectorum</i> phenology. The timing of germination did not significantly vary between any warming treatments and their respective ambient plots. However, plots that were warmed had advances in the timing of <i>B. tectorum</i> flowering and senescence, as well as shorter vegetative growing seasons. The phenological advances caused by warming increased with increasing degrees of experimental warming. The greatest differences between warmed and ambient plots were seen in the length of the vegetative growing season, which was shortened by approximately 12 and 7 days in the +4°C and +2°C warming levels, respectively. The effects of experimental warming were small compared to the effects of interannual climate variation, suggesting that interactive controls and the timing of multiple climatic factors are important in determining <i>B. tectorum</i> phenology. Taken together, these results help elucidate how <i>B. tectorum</i> phenology may respond to future climate, increasing our predictive capacity for estimating when to time <i>B. tectorum</i> control efforts and how to more effectively manage this exotic annual grass."

      "Xanthium strumarium is native to North America and now has become one of the invasive alien species (IAS) in China. In order to detect the effects of the invader on biodiversity and evaluate its suitable habitats and ecological distribution, we investigated the abundance, relative abundance, diversity indices, and the number of the invasive and native plants in paired invaded and non-invaded quadrats in four locations in North and Northeast China. We also analyzed the effects of monthly mean maximum and minimum temperatures, relative humidity (%), and precipitations (mm). Strong positive significant (P < 0.01) correlation and maximum interspecific competition (41%) were found in Huailai between invaded and non-invaded quadrats. Shannon's Diversity Index showed that non-invaded plots had significantly (P < 0.05) more diversified species than invaded ones. The significant (P < 0.05) Margalef's Richness Index was found in Huailai and Zhangjiakou in non-invaded recorded heterogeneous nature of plant communities. Similarly, significant (P < 0.05) species richness found in Huailai and Zhangjiakou in non-invaded quadrats compared to invaded ones. Maximum evenness of Setaria feberi (0.47, 0.37), Seteria viridis (0.43) found in Fushun and Zhangjiakou recorded more stable in a community compared to other localities. Evenness showed positive relationship of Shannon Entropy within different plant species. The higher dissimilarity in plant communities found in Huailai (87.06%) followed by Yangyuan (44.43%), Zhangjiakou (40.13%) and Fushun (29.02%). The significant (P < 0.01) value of global statistics R (0.943/94.3%) showed high species diversity recorded in Huailai followed by Zhangjiakou recorded by non-metric multidimensional scaling and analysis of similarity between invaded and non-invaded plots. At the end it was concluded that the diversity indices reduced significantly (P < 0.05) in invaded quadrats indicated that native plant species become less diverse due to X. strumarium invasion. The degrees of X. strumarium invasion affected on species richness resulted to reduce diversity indices significantly in invaded quadrats."

      "<i>Gleditsia triacanthos</i> is an aggressive invasive species in Eastern Europe, producing a significant number of pods that could represent an inexhaustible resource of raw material for various applications. The aim of this study was to extract cellulose from the <i>Gleditsia triacanthos</i> pods, characterize it by spectrophotometric and UHPLC-DAD-ESI/MS analysis, and use it to fabricate a wound dressing that is multi-functionalized with phenolic compounds extracted from the leaves of the same species. The obtained cellulose microfibers (CM) were functionalized, lyophilized, and characterized by ATR-FTIR and SEM. The water absorption and retention capacity as well as the controlled release of phenolic compounds with antioxidant properties evaluated in temporal dynamics were also determined. The antimicrobial activity against reference and clinical multi-drug-resistant <i>Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, Candida albicans,</i> and <i>Candida parapsilosis</i> strains occurred immediately after the contact with the tested materials and was maintained for 24 h for all tested microbial strains. In conclusion, the multi-functionalized cellulose microfibers (MFCM) obtained from the reproductive organs of an invasive species can represent a promising alternative for the development of functional wound dressings with antioxidant and antimicrobial activity, as well as being a scalable example for designing cost-effective, circular bio-economy approaches to combat the accelerated spread of invasive species."

      "H<sub>2</sub>S is a small molecule known to have multiple signaling roles in animals. Recently, evidence shows that H<sub>2</sub>S also has signaling functions in plants; however, the role of H<sub>2</sub>S in invasive plants is unknown. <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> is a typical invasive species growing along the beaches of southern China. A physiological comparison proves that <i>S. alterniflora</i> is highly tolerant to salinity stress compared with the native species <i>Cyperus malaccensis</i>. To decipher the mechanism that enables <i>S. alterniflora</i> to withstand salinity stress, a chemico-proteomics analysis was performed to examine the salt stress response of the two species; an inhibitor experiment was additionally designed to investigate H<sub>2</sub>S signaling on salinity tolerance in <i>S. alterniflora</i>. A total of 86 proteins belonging to nine categories were identified and differentially expressed in <i>S. alterniflora</i> exposed to salt stress. Moreover, the expression level of enzymes responsible for the H<sub>2</sub>S biosynthesis was markedly upregulated, indicating the potential role of H<sub>2</sub>S signaling in the plant's response to salt stress. The results suggested that salt triggered l-CD enzyme activity and induced the production of H<sub>2</sub>S, therefore upregulating expression of the antioxidants ascorbate peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and S-nitrosoglutathione reductase, which mitigates damage from reactive nitrogen species. Additionally, H<sub>2</sub>S reduced the potassium efflux, thereby sustaining intracellular sodium/potassium ion homeostasis and enhancing <i>S. alterniflora</i> salt tolerance. These findings indicate that H<sub>2</sub>S plays an important role in the adaptation of <i>S. alterniflora</i> to saline environments, which provides greater insight into the function of H<sub>2</sub>S signaling in the adaptation of an invasive plant species."

      "<i>Solanum rostratum</i> is native to Neotropics and southwestern United States and considered as an invasive plant in Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. However, information on the chloroplast (cp) genome of this species is limited. In this study, we present the complete chloroplast genome sequence of <i>S. rostratum</i> obtained by high-throughput nextgeneration sequencing technology. The whole cp genome was 155,559 bp long and comprised 130 genes, including 85 protein-coding genes, 37 tRNA genes, and eight rRNA genes. The <i>S. rostratum</i> cp genome had a GC content of 37.76%. Based on the concatenated coding sequences of cp PCGs, phylogenetic analysis showed that Phylogenetic tree revealed that <i>S. rostratum</i> and <i>S. elaeagnifolium</i> are closely related to each other within the genus <i>Solanum.</i>"

      "<h4>Background</h4><i>Ipomoea cairica</i> (L.) Sweet is a destructive invasive weed in South China but rarely infected with pathogens in nature. Its pathogen resistance mechanism is largely unknown at present. Some non-pathogenic isolates of <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> and <i>Fusarium fujikuroi</i> are prevalent on many plant species and function as pathogen resistance inducers of host plants. The objective of the present research is to investigate whether the symbiosis between the both fungi and <i>I. cairica</i> is present, and thereby induces pathogen resistance of <i>I. cairica.</i><h4>Methods</h4>Through field investigation, we explored the occurrence rates of <i>F. oxysporum</i> and <i>F. fujikuroi</i> on leaf surfaces of <i>I. cairica</i> plants in natural habitats and compared their abundance between healthy leaves and leaves infected with <i>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</i>, a natural pathogen. With artificial inoculation, we assessed their pathogenicity to <i>I. cairica</i> and studied their contribution of pathogen resistance to <i>I. cairica</i> against <i>C. gloeosporioides.</i><h4>Results</h4>We found that <i>F. oxysporum</i> and <i>F. fujikuroi</i> were widely epiphytic on healthy leaf surfaces of <i>I. cairica</i> in sunny non-saline<i>,</i> shady non-saline and sunny saline habitats. Their occurrence rates reached up to 100%. Moreover, we found that the abundance of <i>F. oxysporum</i> and <i>F. fujikuroi</i> on leaves infected with <i>C. gloeosporioides</i> were significantly lower than that of healthy leaves. With artificial inoculation, we empirically confirmed that <i>F. oxysporum</i> and <i>F. fujikuroi</i> were non-pathogenic to <i>I. cairica</i>. It was interesting that colonization by <i>F. fujikuroi</i>, <i>F. oxysporum</i> alone and a mixture of both fungi resulted in a reduction of <i>C. gloeosporioides</i> infection to <i>I. cairica</i> accompanied by lower lesion area to leaf surface area ratio, increased hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) concentration and salicylic acid (SA) level relative to the control. However, <i>NPR1</i> expression, chitinase and β-1,3-glucanase activities as well as stem length and biomass of <i>I. cairica</i> plant only could be significantly improved by <i>F. oxysporum</i> and a mixture of both fungi but not by <i>F. fujikuroi</i>. In addition, as compared to colonization by <i>F. oxysporum</i> and a mixture of both fungi, <i>F. fujikuroi</i> induced significantly higher jasmonic acid (JA) level but significantly lower β-1,3-glucanase activity in leaves of <i>I. cairica</i> plants. Thus, our findings indicated the symbiosis of epiphytic fungi <i>F. fujikuroi</i> and <i>F. oxysporum</i> induced systemic resistance of <i>I. cairica</i> against <i>C. gloeosporioides</i>. <i>F. oxysporum</i> played a dominant role in inducing pathogen resistance of <i>I. cairica</i>. Its presence alleviated the antagonism of the JA signaling on SA-dependent β-1,3-glucanase activity and enabled <i>I. cairica</i> plants to maintain relatively higher level of resistance against <i>C. gloeosporioides.</i>"

      "Invasive species are considered as one of the major threats to ecosystems worldwide. Although invasive plants are regarded as a foe, they could be considered as natural resources for valuable bioactive compounds. The present study aimed to characterize the chemical composition of the essential oil (EO) from the invasive plant <i>Argemone ochroleuca</i> Sweet, collected from Saudi Arabia, as well as to evaluate its phytotoxic activity. Seventy-four compounds were characterized via GC-MS analysis of EO representing 98.75% of the overall mass. The oxygenated constituents (79.01%) were found as the main constituents, including mono- (43.27%), sesqui- (17.67%), and di-terpenes (0.53%), as well as hydrocarbons (16.81%) and carotenoids (0.73%). Additionally, 19.69% from the overall mass was characterized as non-oxygenated compounds with mono- (1.77%), sesquiterpenes (17.41%), and hydrocarbons (0.56%) as minors. From all identified constituents, <i>trans</i>-chrysanthenyl acetate (25.71%), <i>γ</i>-cadinene (11.70%), oleic acid, methyl ester (7.37%), terpinene-4-ol (4.77%), dihydromyrcenol (2.90%), <i>α</i>-muurolene (1.77%), and <i>γ</i>-himachalene (1.56%) were found as abundant. The EO of <i>A. ochroleuca</i> showed significant phytotoxic activity against the test plant <i>Lactuca sativa</i> and the noxious weed <i>Peganum harmala.</i> The EO attained IC<sub>50</sub> values of 92.1, 128.6, and 131.6 µL L<sup>-1</sup> for seedling root growth, germination, and shoot growth of <i>L. sativa</i>, respectively, while it had IC<sub>50</sub> values of 134.8, 145.7, and 147.9 µL L<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, for <i>P. harmala</i>. Therefore, this EO could be used as a bioherbicide against weeds, while further study is recommended for the characterization of the authentic materials of the main compounds in the EO as well as for the evaluation of potency of this oil on a field scale and the determination of its biosafety."

      "Parthenium weed (<i>Parthenium hysterophorus</i> L.) is an invasive plant species in around 50 countries and a 'Weed of National Significance' in Australia. This study investigated the relative toxicity of the leaf, shoot and root extracts of two geographically separate and morphologically distinct biotypes of parthenium weed in Queensland, Australia. Parthenium weed exhibited higher phytotoxic, cytotoxic and photocytotoxic activity in leaf tissue extracts in contrast to shoot and root. The germination and seedling growth of a dicot species (garden cress) were inhibited more than those of a monocot species (annual ryegrass) using a phytotoxicity bioassay. The cytotoxicity of leaf extracts was assessed in a mouse fibroblast cell suspension assay and increased under high ultraviolet A(UV-A) radiation. A major secondary metabolite, parthenin, was found in abundance in leaf extracts and was positively correlated with cytotoxicity but not with photocytotoxicity or phytotoxicity. Ambrosin and chlorogenic acid were also detected and were positively correlated with germination inhibition and the inhibition of radicle elongation, respectively. In addition, other currently unidentified compounds in the leaf extracts were positively correlated with phytotoxicity, cytotoxicity and photocytotoxicity with two to three molecules strongly correlated in each case. Both parthenium weed biotypes investigated did not differ with respect to their relative toxicity, despite their reported differences in invasive potential in the field. This suggests that secondary chemistry plays a limited role in their invasion success."

      "Background:Seed longevity and vigor assessment is crucial for efficient ex situ biodiversity conservation in genebanks but may also have potential applications for the understanding of ecological processes and in situ biodiversity conservation. In fact, one of the factors determining the persistence of invasive species, a main threat to global biodiversity, is the generation of soil seed banks where seeds may remain viable for several years. Artificial seed aging tests using high temperatures and high relative humidity have been described for seed longevity estimation but have been mainly optimized for species with commercial interest. Thus, the aim of the study is to define a rapid and sensitive method to assess seed longevity and vigor through accelerated aging in the worldwide distributed invasive species Carpobrotus edulis to provide tools to biodiversity managers to evaluate invasive potential and develop effective post-eradication plans. Results:Slow seed deterioration rate was obtained when C. edulis seeds were subjected to common accelerated aging temperatures (43-45 °C). This contrasts with the rapid viability decay between 24-72 h when seeds were subjected to temperatures superior to 55 °C, a strong inflection point for this species' thermosensitivity. Relative humidity also played a role in defining seed survival curves, but only at high temperatures, speeding up the deterioration process. The selected aging conditions, 55 °C at 87% relative humidity were tested over two C. edulis populations and three measures were proposed to parametrize the differential sigmoidal seed survival curves, defining the seed resistance to deterioration (L5, aging time where 95% of seeds maintain their viability), medium longevity (L50, 50% of seeds lose their viability) and lethal aging time (L95, 95% of viability loss). Conclusions:An accelerated aging test at 55 °C and 87% relative humidity constitutes a rapid and sensitive method that can be performed within a working week, allowing managers to easily test seed vigor and longevity. This test may contribute to assess invasive potential, design effective monitoring programs and soil seed bank eradication treatments."

      "Airborne fungi and their ecological functions have been largely ignored in plant invasions. In this study, high-throughput sequencing technology was used to characterize the airborne fungi in the canopy air of the invasive weed Ageratina adenophora. Then, representative phytopathogenic strains were isolated from A. adenophora leaf spots and their virulence to A.adenophora as well as common native plants in the invaded range was tested. The fungal alpha diversities were not different between the sampling sites or between the high/low part of the canopy air, but fungal co-occurrences were less common in the high than in the low part of the canopy air. Interestingly, we found that the phytopathogenic Didymellaceae fungi co-occurred more frequently with themselves than with other fungi. Disease experiments indicated that all 5 Didymellaceae strains could infect A. adenophora as well as the 16 tested native plants and that there was large variation in the virulence and host range. Our data suggested that the diverse pathogens in the canopy air might be a disease infection source that weakens the competition of invasive weeds, a novel phenomenon that remains to be explored in other invasive plants."

      "The wild tree tobacco (<i>Nicotiana glauca</i>) is an alien species that invaded vast areas of the Southwestern region of Saudi Arabia. While, the Red Palm Weevil (RPW) (<i>Rhynchophorus ferrugineus</i>) is considered to be the most damaging invasive insect species of palm trees all over the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, causing major economic losses to farmers and the economy of the country. Using conventional insecticides to control harmful insects such as RPW has undesirable effects on the environment and human health. Alternatively, using biocontrol agents such as poisonous extracts from <i>N. glauca</i> might be a better approach in pest management and can be considered as an eco-friendly, cost-effective, and safe alternative. Therefore, the current study aimed to evaluate the larvicidal effect of <i>N. glauca</i> aqueous extracts against the red palm weevil larvae. The plant specimens were collected from Al-Baha region in the Southwest of Saudi Arabia. Each single test consisted of 20 larvae, and <i>N. glauca</i> preparations were; 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3 ml, besides the control test. Results obtained for the effect of botanical extracts; leaf, flower, stem and root against <i>R. ferrugineus</i> larvae for an exposure period of 24 hr. at the concentrations of 2.8, 4.2, 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. The concentrations for <i>N. glauca</i> extracts reflected an LC<sub>50</sub> of 2.7 ppm for leave, 2.6 ppm for flower, 2.8 ppm for stem and 7.00 ppm for root. While, the same concentrations extracts reflected an LC<sub>95</sub>of 11 ppm for leaf, 9.6 ppm for flower, 8.9 ppm for stem and 13.00 ppm for root. These results showed that <i>N. glauca</i> extracts have a remarkable potentiality as insecticidal substances that can be used as an ecofriendly integrated approach for the management of <i>R. ferrugineus</i>."

      "Biological invasions are a defining feature of the Anthropocene, but the factors that determine the spatially uneven distribution of alien plant species are still poorly understood. Here, we present the first global analysis of the effects of biogeographic factors, the physical environment and socio-economy on the richness of naturalized and invasive alien plants. We used generalized linear mixed-effects models and variation partitioning to disentangle the relative importance of individual factors, and, more broadly, of biogeography, physical environment and socio-economy. As measures of the magnitude of permanent anthropogenic additions to the regional species pool and of species with negative environmental impacts, we calculated the relative richness of naturalized (= RRN) and invasive (= RRI) alien plant species numbers adjusted for the number of native species in 838 terrestrial regions. Socio-economic factors (per-capita gross domestic product (GDP), population density, proportion of agricultural land) were more important in explaining RRI (~50 % of the explained variation) than RRN (~40 %). Warm-temperate and (sub)tropical regions have higher RRN than tropical or cooler regions. We found that socio-economic pressures are more relevant for invasive than for naturalized species richness. The expectation that the southern hemisphere is more invaded than the northern hemisphere was confirmed only for RRN on islands, but not for mainland regions nor for RRI. On average, islands have ~6-fold RRN, and >3-fold RRI compared to mainland regions. Eighty-two islands (=26 % of all islands) harbour more naturalized alien than native plants. Our findings challenge the widely held expectation that socio-economic pressures are more relevant for plant naturalization than for invasive plants. To meet international biodiversity targets and halt the detrimental consequences of plant invasions, it is essential to disrupt the connection between socio-economic development and plant invasions by improving pathway management, early detection and rapid response."

      "Solidago canadensis is an invasive plant that is capable of adapting to variable light conditions. To elucidate the shade tolerance mechanism in S. canadensis at the molecular level, transcriptome analyses were performed for leaves growing under natural light and three shade level conditions. Many differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found in the comparative analysis, including those involved in photosynthesis, antioxidant, and secondary metabolism of phenol- and flavonoid-related pathways. Most genes encoding proteins involved in photosynthesis, such as photosystem I reaction center subunit (Psa), photosystem II core complex protein (Psb), and light-harvesting chlorophyll protein (Lhca and Lhcb), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging-related enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT), were upregulated with the shade levels. Furthermore, most of the DEGs related to secondary metabolite synthesis were also upregulated in the shade conditions. Our study indicates that S. canadensis can respond to shade stress by modulating the expression of several photosynthesis-related, free radical scavenging-related, and secondary metabolism-related genes; thus, this species has the ability to adapt to different light conditions."

      "Predictions of habitat suitability for invasive plant species can guide risk assessments at regional and national scales and inform early detection and rapid-response strategies at local scales. We present a general approach to invasive species modeling and mapping that meets objectives at multiple scales. Our methodology is designed to balance trade-offs between developing highly customized models for few species versus fitting non-specific and generic models for numerous species. We developed a national library of environmental variables known to physiologically limit plant distributions and relied on human input based on natural history knowledge to further narrow the variable set for each species before developing habitat suitability models. To ensure efficiency, we used largely automated modeling approaches and human input only at key junctures. We explore and present uncertainty by using two alternative sources of background samples, including five statistical algorithms, and constructing model ensembles. We demonstrate the use and efficiency of the Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling [SAHM 2.1.2], a package in VisTrails, which performs the majority of the modeling analyses. Our workflow includes solicitation of expert feedback on model outputs such as spatial prediction results and variable response curves, and iterative improvement based on new data availability and directed field validation of initial model results. We highlight the utility of the models for decision-making at regional and local scales with case studies of two plant species that invade natural areas: fountain grass (Pennisetum setaceum) and goutweed (Aegopodium podagraria). By balancing model automation with human intervention, we can efficiently provide land managers with mapped predicted distributions for multiple invasive species to inform decisions across spatial scales."

      "The Eupatorium adenophorum have widespread invaded the karst ecosystem of southwest China and threatened the regional native community stability. Arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) plays an important role in promoting growth for host plants via root external mycelia. However, whether AM regulates plant root traits underlying competition between invasive and native species via mycorrhizal networks in karst habitats, remains unclear. An experiment was conducted in a microcosm composed of two planting compartments flanking a competition compartment. The invasive E. adenophorum and native Artemisia annua were each placed in one of the two planting compartments with or without Glomus etunicatum fungus. The nutrient access treatments included the competitive utilization (Cu), single utilization (Su) and non-utilization (Nu) by using different nylon meshes allowed or prevented mycelium passing to acquire nutrients from the competition compartment. Root traits and nutrients of the two species were analyzed. The results showed that AM fungi had differential effects on root traits and nutrients of E. adenophorum and A. annua seedlings, which increased dry weight, length, surface area, volume, tips and branching points in roots, specific root length and volume, root nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) contents under Cu, Su and Nu treatments. AM fungus was also associated with decreases in the average diameter for both species. Under the Cu treatment, E. adenophorum had significantly greater length, surface area, volume, tips and branching points of roots, specific root traits, and root N and P than A. annua. AM fungi changed root phenotypes and nutrient uptake for both invasive and native plant species via interconnected mycorrhizal networks. Overall, our results suggest that through mycorrhizal networks, the invasive plant experiences greater benefits than the native plant in the nutrient competition, which fosters root morphological developments in karst soil."

      "Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) composed of organic polymer-based hole-transporting materials (HTMs) are considered to be an important strategy in improving the device performance, to compete with conventional solar cells. Yet the use of such expensive and unstable HTMs, together with hygroscopic perovskite structure remains a concern - an arguable aspect for the prospect of onsite photovoltaic (PV) application. Herein, we have demonstrated the sustainable fabrication of efficient and air-stable PSCs composed of an invasive plant (Eichhornia crassipes) extracted porous graphitic carbon (EC-GC) which plays a dual role as HTM/counter electrode. The changes in annealing temperature (~450 °C, ~850 °C and ~1000 °C) while extracting the EC-GC, made a significant impact on the degree of graphitization - a remarkable criterion in determining the device performance. Hence, the fabricated champion device-1<sup>c</sup>: Glass/FTO/c-TiO<sub>2</sub>/mp-TiO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3-x</sub>Cl<sub>x</sub>/EC-GC10@CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3-x</sub> Cl<sub>x</sub>/EC-GC10) exhibited a PCE of 8.52%. Surprisingly, the introduced EC-GC10 encapsulated perovskite interfacial layer at the perovskite/HTM interface helps in overcoming the moisture degradation of the hygroscopic perovskite layer in which the same champion device-1<sup>c</sup> evinced better air stability retaining its efficiency ~94.40% for 1000 hours. We believe that this present work on invasive plant extracted carbon playing a dual role, together as an interfacial layer may pave the way towards a reliable perovskite photovoltaic device at low-cost."

      "Invasive plants often interact with antagonists that include native parasitic plants and pathogenic soil microbes, which may reduce fitness of the invaders. However, to date, most of the studies on the ecological consequences of antagonistic interactions between invasive plants and the resident biota focused only on pairwise interactions. A full understanding of invasion dynamics requires studies that test the effects of multiple antagonists on fitness of invasive plants and co-occurring native plants. Here, we used an invasive plant <i>Mikania micrantha</i>, a co-occurring native plant <i>Coix lacryma-jobi,</i> and a native holoparasitic plant <i>Cuscuta campestris</i> to test whether parasitism on <i>M. micrantha</i> interacts with soil fungi and bacteria to reduce fitness of the invader and promote growth of the co-occurring native plant. In a factorial setup, <i>M. micrantha</i> and <i>C. lacryma-jobi</i> were grown together in pots in the presence versus absence of parasitism on <i>M. micrantha</i> by <i>C. campestris</i> and in the presence versus absence of full complements of soil bacteria and fungi. Fungicide and bactericide were used to suppress soil fungi and bacteria, respectively. Findings show that heavy parasitism by <i>C. campestris</i> caused the greatest reduction in <i>M. micrantha</i> biomass when soil fungi and bacteria were suppressed. In contrast, the co-occurring native plant <i>C. lacryma-jobi</i> experienced the greatest increase in biomass when grown with heavily parasitized <i>M. micrantha</i> and in the presence of a full complement of soil fungi and bacteria. Taken together, our results suggest that selective parasitism on susceptible invasive plants by native parasitic plants and soil microorganisms may diminish competitive ability of invasive plants and facilitate native plant coexistence with invasive plants."

      "Root endophytic nitrogen-fixing bacteria (reNFB) have been proposed as important contributors to the invasiveness of exotic legumes; however, the reNFB of invasive nonlegumes has received less attention. In particular, the growth-promoting effect of reNFB on invasive plants remains unknown. In this study, 131 strains of potential nitrogen-fixing bacteria were isolated and purified from the roots of the invasive plant, <i>Ageratina adenophora</i>, in Southwest China. Phylogenetically, these reNFB were categorized into three phyla at 97% sequence identity that included Proteobacteria (92.4%), Actinobacteria (4.6%), and Firmicutes (3.1%). The dominant isolates ranked by number were <i>Pseudomonas</i> (80 isolates, 61.1%), <i>Rhizobium</i> (12 isolates, 9.2%), and <i>Duganella</i> (11 isolates, 8.4%). The community composition and diversity of <i>A. adenophora</i> reNFB were markedly different across study regions. The capacity of these reNFB to accumulate indolyl-3-acetic acid (IAA), solubilize phosphate, and produce siderophores was determined. All 131 isolates of reNFB accumulated IAA, 67 isolates solubilized phosphate, and 108 isolates produced siderophores. Among the three dominant genera of reNFB, <i>Pseudomonas</i> had the highest phosphorus solubilization and siderophore production, while the accumulation of IAA in the genus <i>Duganella</i> was the lowest. Interestingly, the calculated reNFB Shannon diversity index of each <i>A. adenophora</i> individual was negatively correlated with the capacity of reNFB to produce growth-promoting products. Six randomly selected isolates from three dominant genera were further used to conduct inoculation experiments, and all isolates showed significant positive growth-promoting effects on <i>A. adenophora</i> seedlings. The contribution of reNFB to the root biomass was higher than that to the shoot biomass. Our results suggest that reNFB, similar to soil or nodular nitrogen-fixing bacteria, can potentially promote plant growth and may play an important role in the invasion of nonleguminous plants. More detailed studies on the correlation between reNFB and invasive plants are necessary."

      "The variation in habitat has a direct effect on the plants and as a consequence, changes their content of the bioactive constituents and biological activities. The present study aimed to explore the variation in the essential oils (EOs) and phenolics of Heliotropium curassavicum collected from the coastal and inland habitats. Additionally, we determined their antioxidant and allelopathic activity against the weed, Chenopodium murale. Fifty-six compounds were identified as overall from EOs, from which 25 components were identified from the coastal sample, and 52 from the inland one. Sesquiterpenes were the main class in both samples (81.67% and 79.28%), while mono (3.99% and 7.21%) and diterpenes (2.9% and 1.77%) represented minors, respectively. Hexahydrofarnesyl acetone, (-)-caryophyllene oxide, farnesyl acetone, humulene oxide, farnesyl acetone C, and nerolidol epoxy acetate were identified as major compounds. The HPLC analysis of MeOH extracts of the two samples showed that chlorogenic acid, rutin, and propyl gallate are major compounds in the coastal sample, while vanilin, quercetin, and 4',7-dihydroxyisoflavone are majors in the inland one. The EOs showed considerable phytotoxicity against C. murale with IC50 value of 2.66, 0.59, and 0.70 mg mL-1 for germination, root, and shoot growth, respectively from the inland sample. While the coastal sample attained the IC50 values of 1.58, 0.45, and 0.66 mg mL-1. MeOH extracts revealed stronger antioxidant activity compared to the EOs. Based on IC50 values, the ascorbic acid revealed 3-fold of the antioxidant compared to the EO of the coastal sample and 4-fold regarding the inland sample. However, the ascorbic acid showed 3-fold of the antioxidant activity of the MeOH extracts of coastal and inland samples. Although H. curassavicum is considered as a noxious, invasive plant, the present study revealed that EO and MeOH extracts of the H. curassavicum could be considered as promising, eco-friendly, natural resources for antioxidants as well as weed control, particularly against the weed, C. murale."

      "Climate change is increasing the risk of invasive plant expansion worldwide. However, few studies have specified the relationship between invasive plant expansion and ecoregions at the global scale under climate change. To address this gap, we provide risk maps highlighting the response of invasive plant species (IPS), with a focus on terrestrial and freshwater ecoregions to climate change, and further explore the climatic features of ecosystems with a high potential for invasive plant expansion under climate change. We use species distribution modelling to predict the suitable habitats of IPS with records at the global scale. Hotspots with a potential risk of IPS (such as aquatic plants, trees, and herbs) expanding in global ecoregions were distributed in Northern Europe, the UK, South America, North America, southwest China, and New Zealand. Temperature changes were related to the potential of IPS expansion in global ecoregions under climate change. Coastal and high latitude ecoregions, such as temperate forests, alpine vegetation, and coastal rivers, were severely infiltrated by IPS under climate change. Monitoring strategies should be defined for climate change for IPS, particularly for aquatic plants, trees, and herbs in the biomes of regions with coastal or high latitudes. The role of climate change on the potential for IPS expansion should be taken into consideration for biological conservation and risk evaluation of IPS at ecoregional scales."

      "Spatial heterogeneity in soil nutrient availability is considered to play an important role in promoting plant invasion success and can affect interspecific competition. Although some clonal plants have been demonstrated to be correlated with resource heterogeneity in terrestrial systems, little is known about how soil nutrient heterogeneity affects the growth of invasive aquatic plants or their population structure. A greenhouse experiment was therefore conducted to study the response of the invasive aquatic plant <i>Myriophyllum aquaticum</i> to the spatial heterogeneity of soil nutrients under three plant densities (one, four, or twelve plants 0.28 m<sup>2</sup>) with a constant amount of soil nutrients. The results showed that soil nutrient heterogeneity significantly increased the number of shoots in the single-plant density treatment. However, heterogeneous soil nutrient treatment significantly increased the number of shoots at the expense of total biomass and aboveground biomass in the twelve-plant density treatment. The heterogeneous soil nutrient treatment had low effects on other growth traits and intraspecific competition under different plant density treatments. These results indicate that spatial heterogeneity in soil nutrient availability may facilitate the spread of <i>M. aquaticum</i>."

      "For developing global strategies against the dramatic spread of invasive species, we need to identify the geographical, environmental, and socioeconomic factors determining the spatial distribution of invasive species. In our study, we investigated these factors influencing the occurrences of common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca L.), an invasive plant species that is of great concern to the European Union (EU). In a Hungarian study area, we used country-scale soil and climate databases, as well as an EU-scale land cover databases (CORINE) for the analyses. For the abundance data of A. syriaca, we applied the field survey photos from the Land Use and Coverage Area Frame Survey (LUCAS) Land Cover database for the European Union. With machine learning algorithm methods, we quantified the relative weight of the environmental variables on the abundance of common milkweed. According to our findings, soil texture and soil type (sandy soils) were the most important variables determining the occurrence of this species. We could exactly identify the actual land cover types and the recent land cover changes that have a significant role in the occurrence the common milkweed in Europe. We could also show the role of climatic conditions of the study area in the occurrence of this species, and we could prepare the potential distribution map of common milkweed for the study area."

      "We hypothesized that due to the absence of specialist herbivores in introduced ranges, invasive plants have evolved decreased allocation to carbohydrate storage for regrowth ability and as a consequence allocate more to growth. In this study, we compared plant growth, carbohydrate storage and regrowth ability of invasive and native Jacobaea vulgaris in response to complete shoot defoliation. We used invasive J. vulgaris genotypes from three geographically and climactically distinct regions and compared these with native genotypes from Europe. We found that invasive genotypes initially grew larger while native genotypes regrew larger after defoliation. Before defoliation, the carbohydrate storage in roots of invasive genotypes was 38% lower than native genotypes. Biomass after regrowth increased with root carbohydrate storage while it decreased with structural root mass, showing that it is crucial to study root storage and structural components separately in order to investigate plant regrowth. All studied traits of invasive populations from the three geographically and climatologically distinct regions changed in the same expected direction suggesting that the shifts in herbivore guild were causal to the observed change in growth and regrowth ability rather than environmental factors."

      "Plant invasion has been widely recognized as an agent of global change that has the potential to have severe impacts under climate change. The challenges posed by invasive alien plant species (IAPS) on biodiversity and ecosystem stability is growing and not adequately studied, especially in developing countries. Defining climate suitability for multiple invasive plants establishment is important for early and strategic interventions to control and manage plant invasions. We modeled priority IAPS in Sri Lanka to identify the areas of greatest climatic suitability for their establishment and observed how these areas could be altered under projected climate change. We used Maximum Entropy method to model 14 nationally significant IAPS under representative concentration pathways 4.5 and 8.5 for 2050 and 2070. The combined climate suitability map produced by summing up climatic suitability of 14 IAPS was further classified into five classes in ArcMap as very high, high, moderate, low, and very low. South and west parts of Sri Lanka are projected to have potentially higher climatic suitability for a larger number of IAPS. We observed suitable area changes (gains and losses) in all five classes of which two were significant enough to make an overall negative impact i.e., (i) contraction of the very low class and (ii) expansion of the moderate class. Both these changes trigger the potential risk from IAPS in Sri Lanka in the future."

      "The natural recolonization of native plant communities following invasive species management is notoriously challenging to predict, since outcomes can be contingent on a variety of factors including management decisions, abiotic factors, and landscape setting. The spatial scale at which the treatment is applied can also impact management outcomes, potentially influencing plant assembly processes and treatment success. Understanding the relative importance of each of these factors for plant community assembly can help managers prioritize patches where specific treatments are likely to be most successful. Here, using effects size analyses, we evaluate plant community responses following four invasive Phragmites australis management treatments (1: fall glyphosate herbicide spray, 2: summer glyphosate herbicide spray, 3: summer imazapyr herbicide spray, 4: untreated control) applied at two patch scales (12,000 m2 and 1,000 m2) and monitored for 5 years. Using variation partitioning, we then evaluated the independent and shared influence of patch scale, treatment type, abiotic factors, and landscape factors on plant community outcomes following herbicide treatments. We found that Phragmites reinvaded more quickly in large patches, particularly following summer herbicide treatments, while native plant cover and richness increased at a greater magnitude in small patches than large. Patch scale, in combination with abiotic and landscape factors, was the most important driver for most plant responses. Compared with the small plots, large patches commonly had deeper and more prolonged flooding, and were in areas with greater hydrologic disturbance in the landscape, factors associated with reduced native plant recruitment and greater Phragmites cover. Small patches were associated with less flooding and landscape disturbance, and more native plants in the surrounding landscape than large patches, factors which promoted higher native plant conservation values and greater native plant cover and richness. Herbicide type and timing accounted for very little of the variation in native plant recovery, emphasizing the greater importance of patch selection for better management outcomes. To maximize the success of treatment programs, practitioners should first manage Phragmites patches adjacent to native plant species and in areas with minimal hydrologic disturbance."

      "In recent years, an increasing number of distribution maps of invasive alien plant species (IAPS) have been published using different machine learning algorithms (MLAs). However, for designing spatially explicit management strategies, distribution maps should include information on the local cover/abundance of the IAPS. This study compares the performances of five MLAs: gradient boosting machine in two different implementations, random forest, support vector machine and deep learning neural network, one ensemble model and a generalized linear model; thereby identifying the best-performing ones in mapping the fractional cover/abundance and distribution of IPAS, in this case called Prosopis juliflora (SW. DC.). Field level Prosopis cover and spatial datasets of seventeen biophysical and anthropogenic variables were collected, processed, and used to train and validate the algorithms so as to generate fractional cover maps of Prosopis in the dryland ecosystem of the Afar Region, Ethiopia. Out of the seven tested algorithms, random forest performed the best with an accuracy of 92% and sensitivity and specificity >0.89. The next best-performing algorithms were the ensemble model and gradient boosting machine with an accuracy of 89% and 88%, respectively. The other tested algorithms achieved comparably low performances. The strong explanatory variables for Prosopis distributions in all models were NDVI, elevation, distance to villages and distance to rivers; rainfall, temperature, near-infrared and red reflectance, whereas topographic variables, except for elevation, did not contribute much to the current distribution of Prosopis. According to the random forest model, a total of 1.173 million ha (12.33% of the study region) was found to be invaded by Prosopis to varying degrees of cover. Our findings demonstrate that MLAs can be successfully used to develop fractional cover maps of plant species, particularly IAPS so as to design targeted and spatially explicit management strategies."

      "<h4>Absract</h4>The most anthropized regions of the world are characterized by an impressive abundance of invasive plants, which alter local biodiversity and ecosystem services. An alternative strategy to manage these species could be based on the exploitation of their fruits in a framework of bioprospecting to obtain high-added value compounds or phytocomplexes that are useful for humans. Here we tested this hypothesis on three invasive plants (Lonicera japonica Thunb., Phytolacca americana L., and Prunus serotina Ehrh.) in the Po plain (northern Italy) which bear fruits that are highly consumed by frugivorous birds and therefore dispersed over large distances. Our biochemical analyses revealed that unripe fruit shows high antioxidant properties due to the presence of several classes of polyphenols, which have a high benchmark value on the market. Fruit collection for phytochemical extraction could really prevent seed dispersal mediated by frugivorous animals and produce economic gains to support local management actions."

      "Invasion by alien species is a worldwide phenomenon with negative consequences at both natural and production areas. <i>Acacia longifolia</i> is an invasive shrub/small tree well known for its negative ecological impacts in several places around the world. The recent introduction of a biocontrol agent (<i>Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae</i>), an Australian bud-galling wasp which decreases flowering of <i>A. longifolia</i>, in Portugal, demands the development of a cost-efficient method to monitor its establishment. We tested how unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) can be used to map <i>A. longifolia</i> flowering. Our core assumption is as the population of the biocontrol agent increases, its impacts on the reduction of <i>A. longifolia</i> flowering will be increasingly visible. Additionally, we tested if there is a simple linear correlation between the number of flowers of <i>A. longifolia</i> counted in field and the area covered by flowers in the UAV imagery. UAV imagery was acquired over seven coastal areas including frontal dunes, interior sand dunes and pine forests considering two phenological stages: peak and off-peak flowering season. The number of flowers of <i>A. longifolia</i> was counted, in a minimum of 60 1 m<sup>2</sup> quadrats per study area. For each study area, flower presence/absence maps were obtained using supervised Random Forest. The correlation between the number of flowers and the area covered by flowering plants could then be tested. The flowering of <i>A. longifolia</i> was mapped using UAV mounted with RGB and CIR Cannon IXUS/ELPH cameras (Overall Accuracy > 0.96; Cohen's Kappa > 0.85) varying according to habitat type and flowering season. The correlation between the number of flowers counted and the area covered by flowering was weak (<i>r<sup>2</sup></i> between 0.0134 and 0.156). This is probably explained, at least partially, by the high variability of <i>A. longifolia</i> in what regards flowering morphology and distribution. The very high accuracy of our approach to map <i>A. longifolia</i> flowering proved to be cost efficient and replicable, showing great potential for detecting the future decrease in flowering promoted by the biocontrol agent. The attempt to provide a low-cost method to estimate <i>A. longifolia</i> flower productivity using UAV failed, but it provided valuable insights on the future steps."

      "Soil biota community structure can change with latitude, but the effects of changes on native plants, invasive plants, and their herbivores remain unclear. Here, we examined latitudinal variation in the soil biota community associated with the invasive plant Alternanthera philoxeroides and its native congener A. sessilis, and the effects of soil biota community variation on these plants and the beetle Agasicles hygrophila. We characterized the soil bacterial and fungal communities and root-knot nematodes of plant rhizospheres collected from 22 °N to 36.6 °N in China. Soil biota community structure changed with latitude as a function of climate and soil properties. Root-knot nematode abundance and potential soil fungal pathogen diversity (classified with FUNGuild) decreased with latitude, apparently due to higher soil pH and lower temperatures. A greenhouse experiment and lab bioassay showed native plant mass, seed production, and mass of beetles fed native foliage increased with soil collection latitude. However, there were no latitudinal patterns for the invasive plant. These results suggest that invasive and native plants and, consequently, their herbivores have different responses to latitudinal changes in soil-borne enemies, potentially creating spatial variation in enemy release or biotic resistance. This highlights the importance of linking above- and below-ground multitrophic interactions to explore the role of soil biota in non-native plant invasions with a biogeographic approach."

      "In the current study, we present the complete chloroplast genome sequence of <i>Ambrosia artemisiifolia</i>. The genome is 152,223 bp long and consist of 83 protein coding genes, 38 tRNAs, and four rRNAs duplicated in the inverted repeat. Detected large single-copy (LSC) and small single-copy (SSC) regions separated with two inverted repeat regions (IR) of length 25,098. The phylogenetic hypotheses obtained based on the analyses of 18 cp genomes places common ragweed within the tribe Heliantheae of the Asteraceae."

      "The level of invasion (number or proportion of invasive species) in a given area depends on features of the invaded community, propagule pressure, and climate. In this study, we assess the invasive flora of nine islands in the West Indies to identify invasion patterns and evaluate whether invasive species diversity is related to geographical, ecological, and socioeconomic factors. We compiled a database of invasive plant species including information on their taxonomy, origin, pathways of introduction, habitats, and life history. This database was used to evaluate the similarity of invasive floras between islands and to identify invasion patterns at regional (West Indies) and local (island) scales. We found a total of 516 alien plant species that are invasive on at least one of the nine islands studied, with between 24 to 306 invasive species per island. The invasive flora on these islands includes a wide range of taxonomic groups, life forms, and habitats. We detected low similarity in invasive species diversity between islands, with most invasive species (>60%) occurring on a single island and 6% occurring on at least five islands. To assess the importance of different models in predicting patterns of invasive species diversity among islands, we used generalized linear models. Our analyses revealed that invasive species diversity was well predicted by a combination of island area and economic development (gross domestic product per capita and kilometers of paved roadways). Our results provide strong evidence for the roles of geographical, ecological, and socioeconomic factors in determining the distribution and spread of invasive species on these islands. Anthropogenic disturbance and economic development seem to be the major drivers facilitating the spread and predominance of invasive species over native species."

      "Elevated nitrogen associated with global change is believed to promote the invasion of many vigorous exotic plants. However, it is unclear how a weak exotic plant will respond to elevated nitrogen in the future. In this study, the competitive outcome of a weak invasive plant (Galinsoga quadriradiata) and two non-invasive plants was detected. The plants were subjected to 3 types of culture (mixed, monoculture or one-plant), 2 levels of nitrogen (ambient or elevated at a rate of 2 g m-2 yr-1) and 2 levels of light (65% shade or full sunlight). The results showed that elevated nitrogen significantly promoted the growth of both the weak invader and the non-invasive plants in one-plant pots; however, growth promotion was not observed for the non-invasive species in the mixed culture pots. The presence of G. quadriradiata significantly inhibited the growth of the non-invasive plants, and a decreased negative species interaction was detected as a result of elevated nitrogen. Our results suggest that competitive interactions between G. quadriradiata and the non-invasive plants were altered by elevated nitrogen. It provides exceptional evidence that an initially weak invasive plant can become an aggressive invader through elevated nitrogen deposition."

      "Identifying the factors that influence spatial genetic structure among populations can provide insights into the evolution of invasive plants. In this study, we used the common reed (<i>Phragmites australis</i>), a grass native in Europe and invading North America, to examine the relative importance of geographic, environmental (represented by climate here), and human effects on population genetic structure and its changes during invasion. We collected samples of <i>P. australis</i> from both the invaded North American and native European ranges and used molecular markers to investigate the population genetic structure within and between ranges. We used path analysis to identify the contributions of each of the three factors-geographic, environmental, and human-related-to the formation of spatial genetic patterns. Genetic differentiation was observed between the introduced and native populations, and their genetic structure in the native and introduced ranges was different. There were strong effects of geography and environment on the genetic structure of populations in the native range, but the human-related factors manifested through colonization of anthropogenic habitats in the introduced range counteracted the effects of environment. The between-range genetic differences among populations were mainly explained by the heterogeneous environment between the ranges, with the coefficient 2.6 times higher for the environment than that explained by the geographic distance. Human activities were the primary contributor to the genetic structure of the introduced populations. The significant environmental divergence between ranges and the strong contribution of human activities to the genetic structure in the introduced range suggest that invasive populations of <i>P. australis</i> have evolved to adapt to a different climate and to human-made habitats in North America."

      "In the context of expansion of invasive species, survival of invasive plants is conditioned by their ability to adapt. In France, the water primrose Ludwigia grandiflora, an aquatic invasive species, invades yet wet meadows, leading to a depreciation of their fodder value. Understanding its potential adaption is necessary to its management, strong differences between both morphotypes were expected. So morphological and metabolic responses to terrestrial environment were analyzed for aquatic and terrestrial morphotypes. All morphological and biomass variables were greater in the terrestrial morphotype than the aquatic morphotype, independent of conditions. In terrestrial condition, both morphotypes showed a high production of sugars in root tissues, especially in the terrestrial morphotype and both morphotypes produced a low level of amino acids in shoot tissues. All results demonstrate that the terrestrial condition seems a stressful situation for both morphotypes, which activates glycolysis and fermentation pathways to improve their survival under hypoxic stress. But, only the terrestrial morphotype has been able to adjust its metabolism and maintain efficient growth. In the future, a differential transcriptomic analysis will be carried out to confirm this result."

      "<h4>Premise of the study</h4>Tithonia diversifolia (Asteraceae) is an invasive plant species that can outcompete natives and thus poses a great threat to biodiversity in introduced areas. Here, expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeat (EST-SSR) markers were developed and characterized.<h4>Methods and results</h4>Sixteen polymorphic microsatellite loci were isolated from T. diversifolia using transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatic screening. The number of alleles per locus varied from two to four alleles in 48 individuals from three populations. Most of these primers also amplified in T. rotundifolia and some even in Parthenium hysterophorus.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These markers are useful for investigating the genetic structure and evolutionary process of T. diversifolia, which may provide important information for better management."

      "Biotic resistance is the ability of species in a community to limit the invasion of other species. However, biotic resistance is not widely used to control invasive plants. Experimental, functional, and modeling approaches were combined to investigate the processes of invasion by <i>Ageratina altissima</i> (white snakeroot)<i>,</i> a model invasive species in South Korea. We hypothesized that (1) functional group identity would be a good predictor of biotic resistance to <i>A. altissima</i>, whereas a species identity effect would be redundant within a functional group, and (2) mixtures of species would be more resistant to invasion than monocultures. We classified 37 species of native plants into three functional groups based on seven functional traits. The classification of functional groups was based primarily on differences in life longevity and woodiness. A competition experiment was conducted based on an additive competition design with <i>A. altissima</i> and monocultures or mixtures of resident plants. As an indicator of biotic resistance, we calculated a relative competition index (RCI <sub>avg</sub>) based on the average performance of <i>A. altissima</i> in a competition treatment compared with that of the control where only seeds of <i>A. altissima</i> were sown. To further explain the effect of diversity, we tested several diversity-interaction models. In monoculture treatments, RCI <sub>avg</sub> of resident plants was significantly different among functional groups but not within each functional group. Fast-growing annuals (FG1) had the highest RCI <sub>avg</sub>, suggesting priority effects (niche pre-emption). RCI <sub>avg</sub> of resident plants was significantly greater in a mixture than in a monoculture. According to the diversity-interaction models, species interaction patterns in mixtures were best described by interactions between functional groups, which implied niche partitioning. Functional group identity and diversity of resident plant communities were good indicators of biotic resistance to invasion by introduced <i>A. altissima</i>, with the underlying mechanisms likely niche pre-emption and niche partitioning. This method has most potential in assisted restoration contexts, where there is a desire to reintroduce natives or boost their population size due to some previous level of degradation."

      "Occurrences of the invasive plant species <i>Heracleum sosnowskyi</i> Manden. in the Komi Republic (northeastern part of European Russia) were recorded and published in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF http://www.gbif.org) using the RIVR information system (http://ib.komisc.ru/add/rivr/en). RIVR stands for \"Rasprostranenie Invasionnyh Vidov Rastenij\" [Occurrence of Invasion Plant Species]. This citizen science project aims at collecting occurrence data about invasive plant species with the help of citizen scientists. Information can be added by any user after a simple registration (concept) process. However, the data published in GBIF are provided only by professional scientists. The total study area is approximately 19,000 km<sup>2</sup>. The GBIF resource contains 10894 <i>Heracleum sosnowskyi</i> occurrence points, each with their geographical coordinates and photographs of the plants in the locus of growth. The preliminary results of species distribution modelling on the territory of European North-East Russia presented."

      "Ecological and evolutionary processes historically have been assumed to operate on significantly different time-scales. We know now from theory and work in experimental and model systems that these processes can feed back on each other on mutually relevant time-scales.Here, we present evidence of a soil-mediated eco-evolutionary feedback on the population dynamics of an invasive biennial plant, <i>Alliaria petiolata</i>.As populations age, natural selection drives down production of <i>A. petiolata</i>'s important antimycorrhizal allelochemical, sinigrin. This occurs due to density-dependent selection on sinigrin, which is favoured under interspecific, but disfavoured under intraspecific, competition.We show that population stochastic growth rates (λ<sub>S</sub>) and plant densities are positively related to sinigrin concentration measured in seedling roots. This interaction is mediated by sinigrin's positive effect on seedling and summer survival, which are important drivers of λ<sub>S</sub>.Together, these illustrate how the evolution of a trait shaped by natural selection can influence the ecology of a species over a period of just years to decades, altering its trajectory of population growth and interactions with the species in the soil and plant communities it invades.Our findings confirm the predictions that eco-evolutionary feedbacks occur in natural populations. Furthermore, they improve our conceptual framework for projecting future population growth by linking the variation in plant demography to a critical competitive trait (sinigrin) whose selective advantages decrease as populations age."

      "Plant-microbe interactions play crucial roles in species invasions but are rarely investigated at the intraspecific level. Here, we study these interactions in three lineages of a globally distributed plant, Phragmites australis. We use field surveys and a common garden experiment to analyze bacterial communities in the rhizosphere of P. australis stands from native, introduced, and Gulf lineages to determine lineage-specific controls on rhizosphere bacteria. We show that within-lineage bacterial communities are similar, but are distinct among lineages, which is consistent with our results in a complementary common garden experiment. Introduced P. australis rhizosphere bacterial communities have lower abundances of pathways involved in antimicrobial biosynthesis and degradation, suggesting a lower exposure to enemy attack than native and Gulf lineages. However, lineage and not rhizosphere bacterial communities dictate individual plant growth in the common garden experiment. We conclude that lineage is crucial for determination of both rhizosphere bacterial communities and plant fitness.Environmental factors often outweigh host heritable factors in structuring host-associated microbiomes. Here, Bowen et al. show that host lineage is crucial for determination of rhizosphere bacterial communities in Phragmites australis, a globally distributed invasive plant."

      "Invasive plant species often form dense mono-dominant stands in areas they have invaded, while having only sparse distribution in their native ranges, and the reasons behind this phenomenon are a key point of research in invasive species biology. Differences in species composition between native and invasive ranges may contribute to the difference in distribution status. In this study, we found that the high-density condition had a more negative effect on C. odorata than the low-density condition when co-grown with neighbor plants from its native range in Mexico, while this pattern was not in evidence when it was grown with neighbors from its invasive range in China. Different competitive ability and coevolutionary history with C. odorata between native-range neighbors and invasive-range neighbors may lead to the inconsistent patterns."

      "<h4>Background</h4>As a means of biologically controlling Mikania micrantha H.B.K. in Yunnan, China, the influence of sweet potato [Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.] on its reproductive characteristics was studied. The trial utilized a de Wit replacement series incorporating six ratios of sweet potato and M. micrantha plants in 25 m(2) plots over 2 years.<h4>Results</h4>Budding of M. micrantha occurred at the end of September; flowering and fruiting occurred from October to February. Flowering phenology of M. micrantha was delayed (P < 0.05), duration of flowering and fruiting was reduced (P < 0.05) and duration of bud formation was increased (P < 0.05) with increasing proportions of sweet potato. Reproductive allocation, reproductive investment and reproductive index of M. micrantha were significantly reduced (P < 0.05) with increasing sweet potato densities. Apidae bees, and Calliphoridae or Syrphidae flies were the most abundant visitors to M. micrantha flowers. Overall flower visits decreased (P < 0.05) as sweet potato increased. Thus the mechanism by which sweet potato suppressed sexual reproduction in M. micrantha was essentially two-fold: causing a delay in flowering phenology and reducing pollinator visits. The number, biomass, length, set rate, germination rate, and 1000-grain dry weight of M. micrantha seeds were suppressed (P < 0.05) by sweet potato competition. With proportional increases in sweet potato, sexual and asexual seedling populations of M. micrantha were significantly reduced (P < 0.05). The mortality of both seedling types increased (P < 0.05) with proportional increases in sweet potato.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These results suggest that sweet potato significantly suppresses the reproductive ability of the invasive species M. micrantha, and is a promising alternative to traditional biological control and other methods of control. Planting sweet potato in conjunction with other control methods could provide a comprehensive strategy for managing M. micrantha. The scenario of controlling M. micrantha by utilizing a crop with a similar growth form may provide a useful model for similar management strategies in other systems."

      "Excessive herbivory can have transformative effects on forest understory vegetation, converting diverse communities into depauperate ones, often with increased abundance of non-native plants. White-tailed deer are a problematic herbivore throughout much of eastern North America and alter forest understory community structure. Reducing (by culling) or eliminating (by fencing) deer herbivory is expected to return understory vegetation to a previously diverse condition. We examined this assumption from 1992 to 2006 at Fermilab (Batavia, IL) where a cull reduced white-tailed deer (<i>Odocoileus virginianus</i>) abundance in 1998/1999 by 90 % from 24.6 to 2.5/km<sup>2</sup>, and at West Point, NY, where we assessed interactive effects of deer, earthworms, and invasive plants using 30 × 30 m paired fenced and open plots in 12 different forests from 2009 to 2012. We recorded not only plant community responses (species presence and cover) within 1 m<sup>2</sup> quadrats, but also responses of select individual species (growth, reproduction). At Fermilab, introduced <i>Alliaria petiolata</i> abundance initially increased as deer density increased, but then declined after deer reduction. The understory community responded to the deer cull by increased cover, species richness and height, and community composition changed but was dominated by early successional native forbs. At West Point plant community composition was affected by introduced earthworm density but not deer exclusion. Native plant cover increased and non-native plant cover decreased in fenced plots, thus keeping overall plant cover similar. At both sites native forb cover increased in response to deer reduction, but the anticipated response of understory vegetation failed to materialize at the community level. Deer-favoured forbs (<i>Eurybia divaricata</i>, <i>Maianthemum racemosum</i>, <i>Polygonatum pubescens</i> and <i>Trillium recurvatum</i>) grew taller and flowering probability increased in the absence of deer. Plant community monitoring fails to capture initial and subtle effects of reduced or even cessation of deer browse on browse sensitive species. Measuring responses of individual plants (growth, flowering and reproductive success) provides a more sensitive and powerful assessment of forest understory responses to deer management."

      "The integration of invasive species into native food webs represent multifarious dynamics of ecological and evolutionary processes. We document incorporation of Prunus serotina (black cherry) into native insect food webs. We find that P. serotina harbours a herbivore community less dense but more diverse than its native relative, P. padus (bird cherry), with similar proportions of specialists and generalists. While herbivory on P. padus remained stable over the past century, that on P. serotina gradually doubled. We show that P. serotina may have evolved changes in investment in cyanogenic glycosides compared with its native range. In the leaf beetle Gonioctena quinquepunctata, recently shifted from native Sorbus aucuparia to P. serotina, we find divergent host preferences on Sorbus- versus Prunus-derived populations, and weak host-specific differentiation among 380 individuals genotyped for 119 SNP loci. We conclude that evolutionary processes may generate a specialized herbivore community on an invasive plant, allowing prognoses of reduced invasiveness over time. On the basis of the results presented here, we would like to caution that manual control might have the adverse effect of a slowing down of processes of adaptation, and a delay in the decline of the invasive character of P. serotina."

      "In recent decades, arboreal Darwin's Finches have suffered from a dramatic population decline, which has been attributed to parasitism by the invasive botfly <i>Philornis downsi</i>. However, changes to their primary habitat caused by invasive plant species may have additionally contributed to the observed population decline. The humid cloud forest on Santa Cruz Island is a stronghold of arboreal Darwin's Finches but has been invaded by blackberry (<i>Rubus niveus</i>). In some areas, manual control and herbicide application are used to combat this invasion, both causing a temporary removal of the entire understory. We hypothesized that the removal of the understory reduces the availability of arthropods, which are a main food source during chick rearing. We compared the foraging behaviour of Warbler Finches (<i>Certhidea olivacea</i>) and Small Tree Finches (<i>Camarhynchus parvulus</i>) at three study sites that varied in the degree of <i>R. niveus</i> invasion and the length of time since the last herbicide application. We used prey attack rate and foraging success as an index for food availability and predicted a lower attack rate and foraging success in areas that had recently been sprayed with herbicides. We found that both the invasion and the management of <i>R. niveus</i> influenced microhabitat use, foraging substrate and prey choice in both species. Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not find a lower attack rate or foraging success in the area with recent herbicide application. This may be explained by the finding that both species mainly foraged in the canopy but also used dead plant structures of the understory of the recently controlled area that resulted from the invasive plant management."

      "Establishing relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem function is an ongoing endeavor in contemporary ecosystem and community ecology, with important practical implications for conservation and the maintenance of ecosystem services. Removal of invasive plant species to conserve native diversity is a common management objective in many ecosystems, including wetlands. However, substantial changes in plant community composition have the potential to alter sediment characteristics and ecosystem services, including permanent removal of nitrogen from these systems via microbial denitrification. A balanced assessment of costs associated with keeping and removing invasive plants is needed to manage simultaneously for biodiversity and pollution targets. We monitored small-scale removals of Phragmites australis over four years to determine their effects on potential denitrification rates relative to three untreated Phragmites sites and adjacent sites dominated by native Typha angustifolia. Sediment ammonium increased following the removal of vegetation from treated sites, likely as a result of decreases in both plant uptake and nitrification. Denitrification potentials were lower in removal sites relative to untreated Phragmites sites, a pattern that persisted at least two years following removal as native plant species began to re-colonize treated sites. These results suggest the potential for a trade-off between invasive-plant management and nitrogen-removal services. A balanced assessment of costs associated with keeping versus removing invasive plants is needed to adequately manage simultaneously for biodiversity and pollution targets."

      "Invasive species demonstrate rapid evolution within a very short period of time allowing one to understand the underlying mechanism(s). Lantana camara, a highly invasive plant of the tropics and subtropics, has expanded its range and successfully established itself almost throughout India. In order to uncover the processes governing the invasion dynamics, 218 individuals from various locations across India were characterized with six microsatellites. By integrating genetic data with niche modelling, we examined the effect of drift and environmental selection on genetic divergence. We found multiple genetic clusters that were non-randomly distributed across space. Spatial autocorrelation revealed a strong fine-scale structure, i.e. isolation by distance. In addition, we obtained evidence of inhibitory effects of selection on gene flow, i.e. isolation by environmental distance. Perhaps, local adaptation in response to selection is offsetting gene flow and causing the populations to diverge. Niche models suggested that temperature and precipitation play a major role in the observed spatial distribution of this plant. Based on a non-random distribution of clusters, unequal gene flow among them and different bioclimatic niche requirements, we concluded that the emergence of ecotypes represented by two genetic clusters is underway. They may be locally adapted to specific climatic conditions, and perhaps at the very early stages of ecological divergence."

      "Host-enemy interactions are vital mechanisms that explain the success or failure of invasive plants in new ranges. We surveyed the defoliation of invasive Alternanthera philoxeroides and co-occurring native plants on two islands during different seasons over three consecutive years and measured the leaf nitrogen content and the C/N ratio of each plant species. To evaluate the effects of herbivory on A. philoxeroides, an herbivore exclosure experiment was conducted. We found that the mean defoliation of A. philoxeroides was higher than that of native plants, regardless of whether the dominant species was A. philoxeroides or native plants. A. philoxeroides defoliation increased significantly as the months progressed, whereas the defoliation of the total population of native plants was constant. The leaf nitrogen content was positively correlated with defoliation, and it was highest in A. philoxeroides. Additionally, A. philoxeroides in the herbivore exclusion treatment showed an increase in shoot biomass and total shoot length. Our study revealed that native generalist herbivores prefer the invasive plant to the natives because of the higher leaf nitrogen content. These results support the biotic resistance hypothesis, suggesting that native herbivore species can limit the population spread of invasive plants."

      "Release from specialist insect herbivores may allow invasive plants to evolve traits associated with decreased resistance and increased competitive ability. Given that there may be genetic trade-off between resistance and tolerance, invasive plants could also become more tolerant to herbivores. Although it is widely acknowledged that light availability affects tolerance to herbivores, little information is available for whether the effect of light availability on tolerance differ between the introduced and native populations. We conducted a common garden experiment in the introduced range of Alternanthera philoxeroides using ten invasive US and ten native Argentinean populations at two levels of light availability and in the presence or absence of a specialist stem-boring insect Agasicles hygrophila. Plant biomass (total and storage root biomass), two allocation traits (root/shoot ratio and branch intensity, branches biomass/main stem biomass) and two functional traits (specific stem length and specific leaf area), which are potentially associated with herbivore resistance and light capture, were measured. Overall, we found that A. philoxeroides from introduced ranges had comparable biomass and tolerance to specialist herbivores, lower branch intensity, lower specific stem length and specific leaf area. Moreover, introduced populations displayed higher shade tolerance of storage root biomass and lower plastic response to shading in specific stem length. Finally, light availability had no significant effect on evolution of tolerance to specialist herbivores of A. philoxeroides. Our results suggest that post-introduction evolution might have occurred in A. philoxeroides. While light availability did not influence the evolution of tolerance to specialist herbivores, increased shade tolerance and release from specialist insects might have contributed to the successful invasion of A. philoxeroides."

      "Understanding plant-microbe relationships can be important for developing management strategies for invasive plants, particularly when these relationships interact with underlying variables, such as habitat type and seedbank density, to mediate control efforts. In a field study located in California, USA, we investigated how soil microbial communities differ across the invasion front of Taeniatherum caput-medusae (medusahead), an annual grass that has rapidly invaded most of the western USA. Plots were installed in habitats where medusahead invasion is typically successful (open grassland) and typically not successful (oak woodland). Medusahead was seeded into plots at a range of densities (from 0-50,000 seeds/m2) to simulate different levels of invasion. We found that bacterial and fungal soil community composition were significantly different between oak woodland and open grassland habitats. Specifically, ectomycorrhizal fungi were more abundant in oak woodlands while arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and plant pathogens were more abundant in open grasslands. We did not find a direct effect of medusahead density on soil microbial communities across the simulated invasion front two seasons after medusahead were seeded into plots. Our results suggest that future medusahead management initiatives might consider plant-microbe interactions."

      "Ambrosia artemisiifolia L., (common ragweed), is an annual invasive and highly troublesome plant species originating from North America that has become widespread across Europe. New sets of genomic and expressed sequence tag (EST) based simple sequence repeats (SSRs) markers were developed in this species using three approaches. After validation, 13 genomic SSRs and 13 EST-SSRs were retained and used to characterize the genetic diversity and population genetic structure of Ambrosia artemisiifolia populations from the native (North America) and invasive (Europe) ranges of the species. Analysing the mating system based on maternal families did not reveal any departure from complete allogamy and excess homozygosity was mostly due the presence of null alleles. High genetic diversity and patterns of genetic structure in Europe suggest two main introduction events followed by secondary colonization events. Cross-species transferability of the newly developed markers to other invasive species of the Ambrosia genus was assessed. Sixty-five percent and 75% of markers, respectively, were transferable from A. artemisiifolia to Ambrosia psilostachya and Ambrosia tenuifolia. 40% were transferable to Ambrosia trifida, this latter species being seemingly more phylogenetically distantly related to A. artemisiifolia than the former two."

      "Understanding how invasive plants may alter predator avoidance behaviors is important for granivorous rodents because their foraging can trigger ripple effects in trophic webs. Previous research has shown that European beach grass Ammophila arenaria, an invasive species in coastal California, affects the predation of other seeds by the rodents Microtus californicus, Peromyscus maniculatus, and Reithrodontomys megalotis. This may be due to lower perceived predation risk by rodents foraging in close proximity to the cover provided by Ammophila, but this mechanism has not yet been tested. We examined the perceived predation risk of rodents by measuring the 'giving up density' of food left behind in experimental patches of food in areas with and without abundant cover from Ammophila and under varying amount of moonlight. We found strong evidence that giving up density was lower in the thick uniform vegetation on Ammophila-dominated habitat than it was in the more sparsely and diversely vegetated restored habitat. There was also evidence that moonlight affected giving up density and that it mediated the effects of habitat, although with our design we were unable to distinguish the effects of lunar illumination and moon phase. Our findings illustrate that foraging rodents, well known to be risk-averse during moonlit nights, are also affected by the presence of an invasive plant. This result has implications for granivory and perhaps plant demography in invaded and restored coastal habitats. Future research in this system should work to unravel the complex trophic links formed by a non-native invasive plant (i.e., Ammophila) providing cover favored by native rodents, which likely forage on and potentially limit the recruitment of native and non-native plants, some of which have ecosystem consequences of their own."

      "Containment can be a viable strategy for managing invasive plants, but it is not always cheaper than eradication. In many cases, converting a failed eradication programme to a containment programme is not economically justified. Despite this, many contemporary invasive plant management strategies invoke containment as a fallback for failed eradication, often without detailing how containment would be implemented.We demonstrate a generalized analysis of the costs of eradication and containment, applicable to any plant invasion for which infestation size, dispersal distance, seed bank lifetime and the economic discount rate are specified. We estimate the costs of adapting eradication and containment in response to six types of breach and calculate under what conditions containment may provide a valid fallback to a breached eradication programme.We provide simple, general formulae and plots that can be applied to any invasion and show that containment will be cheaper than eradication only when the size of the occupied zone exceeds a multiple of the dispersal distance determined by seed bank longevity and the discount rate. Containment becomes proportionally cheaper than eradication for invaders with smaller dispersal distances, longer lived seed banks, or for larger discount rates.Both containment and eradication programmes are at risk of breach. Containment is less exposed to risk from reproduction in the 'occupied zone' and three types of breach that lead to a larger 'occupied zone', but more exposed to one type of breach that leads to a larger 'buffer zone'.For a well-specified eradication programme, only the three types of breach leading to reproduction in or just outside the buffer zone can justify falling back to containment, and only if the expected costs of eradication and containment were comparable before the breach.<i>Synthesis and applications</i>. Weed management plans must apply a consistent definition of containment and provide sufficient implementation detail to assess its feasibility. If the infestation extent, dispersal capacity, seed bank longevity and economic discount rate are specified, the general results presented here can be used to assess whether containment can outperform eradication, and under what conditions it would provide a valid fallback to a breached eradication programme."

      "Anthropogenic disturbances often change ecological communities and provide opportunities for non-native species invasion. Understanding the impacts of disturbances on species invasion is therefore crucial for invasive species management. We used generalized linear mixed effects models to explore the influence of land-use history and distance to roads on the occurrence and abundance of two invasive plant species (Rosa multiflora and Berberis thunbergii) in a 900-ha deciduous forest in the eastern U.S.A., the Powdermill Nature Reserve. Although much of the reserve has been continuously forested since at least 1939, aerial photos revealed a variety of land-uses since then including agriculture, mining, logging, and development. By 2008, both R. multiflora and B. thunbergii were widespread throughout the reserve (occurring in 24% and 13% of 4417 10-m diameter regularly-placed vegetation plots, respectively) with occurrence and abundance of each varying significantly with land-use history. Rosa multiflora was more likely to occur in historically farmed, mined, logged or developed plots than in plots that remained forested, (log odds of 1.8 to 3.0); Berberis thunbergii was more likely to occur in plots with agricultural, mining, or logging history than in plots without disturbance (log odds of 1.4 to 2.1). Mining, logging, and agriculture increased the probability that R. multiflora had >10% cover while only past agriculture was related to cover of B. thunbergii. Proximity to roads was positively correlated with the occurrence of R. multiflora (a 0.26 increase in the log odds for every 1-m closer) but not B. thunbergii, and roads had no impact on the abundance of either species. Our results indicated that a wide variety of disturbances may aid the introduction of invasive species into new habitats, while high-impact disturbances such as agriculture and mining increase the likelihood of high abundance post-introduction."

      "Although local eradication is routinely attempted following introduction of disease into a new region, failure is commonplace. Epidemiological principles governing the design of successful control are not well-understood. We analyse factors underlying the effectiveness of reactive eradication of localised outbreaks of invading plant disease, using citrus canker in Florida as a case study, although our results are largely generic, and apply to other plant pathogens (as we show via our second case study, citrus greening). We demonstrate how to optimise control via removal of hosts surrounding detected infection (i.e. localised culling) using a spatially-explicit, stochastic epidemiological model. We show how to define optimal culling strategies that take account of stochasticity in disease spread, and how the effectiveness of disease control depends on epidemiological parameters determining pathogen infectivity, symptom emergence and spread, the initial level of infection, and the logistics and implementation of detection and control. We also consider how optimal culling strategies are conditioned on the levels of risk acceptance/aversion of decision makers, and show how to extend the analyses to account for potential larger-scale impacts of a small-scale outbreak. Control of local outbreaks by culling can be very effective, particularly when started quickly, but the optimum strategy and its performance are strongly dependent on epidemiological parameters (particularly those controlling dispersal and the extent of any cryptic infection, i.e. infectious hosts prior to symptoms), the logistics of detection and control, and the level of local and global risk that is deemed to be acceptable. A version of the model we developed to illustrate our methodology and results to an audience of stakeholders, including policy makers, regulators and growers, is available online as an interactive, user-friendly interface at http://www.webidemics.com/. This version of our model allows the complex epidemiological principles that underlie our results to be communicated to a non-specialist audience."

      "Our understanding of the potential mechanisms driving the spread and naturalization of alien plant species has increased over the past decades, but specific knowledge on the factors contributing to their increased impact in the introduced range is still urgently needed. The native European plant Centaurea stoebe occurs as two cytotypes with different life histories (monocarpic diploids, allo-polycarpic tetraploids). However, only tetraploids have been found in its introduced range in North America, where C. stoebe has become a most prominent plant invader. Here, we focus on the ploidy level of C. stoebe and origin of neighbouring community in explaining the high impact during the invasion of new sites in the introduced range. We conducted a mesocosm experiment under open-field conditions with the diploid (EU2x) and tetraploid (EU4x) cytotype of Centaurea stoebe from its native European (EU) range, and with the invasive tetraploid (NA4x) cytotype from the introduced North American (NA) range in competition with EU (old) or NA (new) neighbouring plant communities. In the presence of competition, the biomass of EU neighbouring community was reduced to a comparable level by all three geo-cytotypes of C. stoebe. In contrast, the biomass of the NA neighbouring community was reduced beyond when competing with tetraploid, but not with diploid C. stoebe. The fact that the biomass of all three geo-cytotypes of C. stoebe was correlated with the biomass of the EU neighbouring community, but not with that of the NA neighbouring community suggests that different mechanisms underlie the competitive interactions between C. stoebe and its old vs. new neighbouring communities, such as competition for the same limiting resources at home vs competition through novel allelo-chemicals or differential resource uptake strategies in the introduced range. We therefore caution to simply use the ecosystem impact assessed at home to predict impact in the introduced range."

      "Plant species distributions are determined by the response of populations to regional climates; however, little is known about how alien plants that arrive in central Europe from climatically warmer regions cope with the temperature conditions at the early stage of population development. Ambrosia artemisiifolia (common ragweed) is an invasive annual plant causing considerable health and economic problems in Europe. Although climate-based models predict that the whole of the Czech Republic is climatically suitable for this species, it is confined to the warmest regions. To determine the factors possibly responsible for its restricted occurrence, we investigated the effects of temperature and nutrient availability on its seedlings. The plants were cultivated at one of seven temperature regimes ranging from 10 to 34 °C, combined with three nutrient levels. The data on the rate of leaf development were used to calculate the lower developmental threshold (LDT, the temperature, in °C, below which development ceases), the sum of effective temperatures (SET, the amount of heat needed to complete a developmental stage measured in degree days above LDT) and width of the thermal window. The rate of development decreased with decrease in temperature and nutrient supply. Besides this, the decrease in the availability of nutrients resulted in decreased LDT, increased SET and wider thermal window. The dependence of LDT and SET on the availability of nutrients contradicts the concept that thermal constants do not vary. Our results highlight temperature as the main determinant of common ragweed's distribution and identify nutrient availability as a factor that results in the realized niche being smaller than the fundamental niche; both of these need to be taken into account when predicting the future spread of A. artemisiifolia."

      "There is growing appreciation for the idea that plant-soil interactions (e.g. allelopathy and plant-microbe feedbacks) may explain the success of some non-native plants. Where this is the case, native plant restoration may require management tools that change plant-soil interactions. Activated carbon (AC) is one such potential tool. Previous research has shown the potential for high concentrations of AC to restore native plant growth to areas dominated by non-natives on a small scale (1 m × 1 m plots). Here we (i) test the efficacy of different AC concentrations at a larger scale (15 m × 15 m plots), (ii) measure microbial responses to AC treatment and (iii) use a greenhouse experiment to identify the primary mechanism, allelopathy versus microbial changes, through which AC impacts native and non-native plant growth. Three years after large-scale applications, AC treatments decreased non-native plant cover and increased the ratio of native to non-native species cover, particularly at concentrations >400 g m(-2). Activated carbon similarly decreased non-native plant growth in the greenhouse. This effect, however, was only observed in live soils, suggesting that AC effects were microbially mediated and not caused by direct allelopathy. Bacterial community analysis of field soils indicated that AC increased the relative abundance of an unidentified bacterium and an Actinomycetales and decreased the relative abundance of a Flavobacterium, suggesting that these organisms may play a role in AC effects on plant growth. Results support the idea that manipulations of plant-microbe interactions may provide novel and effective ways of directing plant growth and community development (e.g. native plant restoration)."

      "Little is known about how an introduced species may expand its ecological range, i.e. the set of local environmental conditions in which it can successfully establish populations. Delimiting this range of conditions is a methodological challenge, because it is impossible to sample all potential field locations for any species in a given region. Developing approaches to track ecological range over time could substantially contribute to understanding invasion dynamics. In this study, we use a previously established sampling strategy to document apparent changes across a 15-year time interval in the ecological range of the Asian annual Polygonum cespitosum Blume in northeastern North America, where the species has recently become invasive. Using a structured sample drawn from a large set of field populations, we determined the range of light, soil moisture and soil nutrient conditions that the species currently occupies in this region and the proportional distribution of individuals in differing types of microsite, and compared them with field measurements that were similarly determined 15 years earlier. Although in 1994 the species was absent from both high-light and flooded habitats, in 2009 P. cespitosum occurred in open as well as shaded habitats, across a wide range of moisture conditions. In 2009 the species also occupied a greater proportion of high-light microsites within field sites than in 1994. These findings suggest an expanded ecological range that, intriguingly, is consistent with the recent evolution in North American P. cespitosum populations of adaptive plasticity in response to high light. Possible non-evolutionary explanations for the change in field distribution are also considered."

      "In recent years, a few established populations of Selinum alatum have been found in the Eastern Carpathians outside its native range that is the Caucasus and the Armenian Highlands. The species is spreading predominantly in Poland where it can outcompete native plants in certain cases. This study addresses a potential climatic niche of the plant with the special aims to illuminate future spreading and indicate areas suitable for invasion. Our results show that the extent of the favourable habitat of the species is broader than currently known. This suggests that the plant has the ability to become a potential new element in some semi-natural or disturbed ecosystems associated with mountainous areas, especially in Central and Southern Europe. Future (2070) models mostly rendered similar suitability maps, but showed slight differences over particular areas and a contraction of suitable habitats, mainly in the northern part of the non-native range."

      "Disturbances are a primary facilitator of the growth and spread of invasive species. However, the effects of large-scale disturbances, such as hurricanes and tropical storms, on the broad geographic patterns of invasive species growth and spread have not been investigated. We used historical aerial imagery to determine the growth rate of invasive Phragmites australis patches in wetlands along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of the United States. These were relatively undisturbed wetlands where P. australis had room for unrestricted growth. Over the past several decades, invasive P. australis stands expanded in size by 6-35% per year. Based on tropical storm and hurricane activity over that same time period, we found that the frequency of hurricane-force winds explained 81% of the variation in P. australis growth over this broad geographic range. The expansion of P. australis stands was strongly and positively correlated with hurricane frequency. In light of the many climatic models that predict an increase in the frequency and intensity of hurricanes over the next century, these results suggest a strong link between climate change and species invasion and a challenging future ahead for the management of invasive species."

      "A considerable number of host-specific biological control agents fail to control invasive plants in the field, and exploring the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is important and helpful for the management of invasive plants. Herbivory and competition are two of the most common biotic stressors encountered by invasive plants in their recipient communities. We predicted that the antagonistic interactive effect between herbivory and competition would weaken the effect of herbivory on invasive plants and result in the failure of herbivory to control invasive plants. To examine this prediction, thus, we conducted an experiment in which both invasive Mikania micrantha and native Coix lacryma-job i were grown together and subjected to herbivory-mimicking defoliation. Both defoliation and competition had significantly negative effects on the growth of the invader. However, the negative effect of 75% respective defoliation on the above- and below-ground biomass of Mikania micrantha was alleviated by presence of Coix lacryma-jobi. The negative effect of competition on the above- and below-ground biomass was equally compensated at 25%, 50% and 100% defoliation and overcompensated at 75% defoliation. The interactive effect was antagonistic and dependent on the defoliation intensity, with the maximum effect at 75% defoliation. The antagonistic interaction between defoliation and competition appears to be able to release the invader from competition, thus facilitating the invasiveness of Mikania, a situation that might make herbivory fail to inhibit the growth of invasive Mikania in the invaded community."

      "The data relating to the nectaries and nectar secretion in invasive Brassicacean taxa are scarce. In the present paper, the nectar production and nectar carbohydrate composition as well as the morphology, anatomy and ultrastructure of the floral nectaries in Bunias orientalis were investigated. Nectary glands were examined using light, fluorescence, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy. The quantities of nectar produced by flowers and total sugar mass in nectar were relatively low. Total nectar carbohydrate production per 10 flowers averaged 0.3 mg. Nectar contained exclusively glucose (G) and fructose (F) with overall G/F ratio greater than 1. The flowers of B. orientalis have four nectaries placed at the base of the ovary. The nectarium is intermediate between two nectary types: the lateral and median nectary type (lateral and median glands stay separated) and the annular nectary type (both nectaries are united into one). Both pairs of glands represent photosynthetic type and consist of epidermis and glandular tissue. However, they differ in their shape, size, secretory activity, dimensions of epidermal and parenchyma cells, thickness of secretory parenchyma, phloem supply, presence of modified stomata and cuticle ornamentation. The cells of nectaries contain dense cytoplasm, plastids with starch grains and numerous mitochondria. Companion cells of phloem lack cell wall ingrowths. The ultrastructure of secretory cells indicates an eccrine mechanism of secretion. Nectar is exuded throughout modified stomata."

      "Disruption of mycorrhizal fungi that form symbioses with local native plants is a strategy used by some invasive exotic plants for competing within their resident communities. Example invasive plants include Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard) and Brassica nigra (black mustard), both non-mycorrhizal plants in the Family Brassicaceae. Although there is clear evidence for mycorrhizal degradation, it is not known if such an effect is widespread across the naturalized range. In this study, we tested the ability of black mustard to degrade the local mycorrhizal symbiosis and supress the growth of native flora from across a variety of locations where black mustard has invaded. We found that the effects on mycorrhizal fungi and on the growth of native plants were consistently negative at the various sites. The present results indicate that degradation of the mycorrhizal symbiosis by black mustard is of general significance, and may be highly problematic considering the large range that it has occupied in open fields across North America."

      "<h4>Background</h4>Invasive species can be a major threat to native biodiversity and the number of invasive plant species is increasing across the globe. Population genetic studies of invasive species can provide key insights into their invasion history and ensuing evolution, but also for their control. Here we genetically characterise populations of Impatiens glandulifera, an invasive plant in Europe that can have a major impact on native plant communities. We compared populations from the species' native range in Kashmir, India, to those in its invaded range, along a latitudinal gradient in Europe. For comparison, the results from 39 other studies of genetic diversity in invasive species were collated.<h4>Results</h4>Our results suggest that I. glandulifera was established in the wild in Europe at least twice, from an area outside of our Kashmir study area. Our results further revealed that the genetic diversity in invasive populations of I. glandulifera is unusually low compared to native populations, in particular when compared to other invasive species. Genetic drift rather than mutation seems to have played a role in differentiating populations in Europe. We find evidence of limitations to local gene flow after introduction to Europe, but somewhat less restrictions in the native range. I. glandulifera populations with significant inbreeding were only found in the species' native range and invasive species in general showed no increase in inbreeding upon leaving their native ranges. In Europe we detect cases of migration between distantly located populations. Human activities therefore seem to, at least partially, have facilitated not only introductions, but also further spread of I. glandulifera across Europe.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Although multiple introductions will facilitate the retention of genetic diversity in invasive ranges, widespread invasive species can remain genetically relatively invariant also after multiple introductions. Phenotypic plasticity may therefore be an important component of the successful spread of Impatiens glandulifera across Europe."

      "The rapid growth and increasing popularity of smartphone technology is putting sophisticated data-collection tools in the hands of more and more citizens. This has exciting implications for the expanding field of citizen science. With smartphone-based applications (apps), it is now increasingly practical to remotely acquire high quality citizen-submitted data at a fraction of the cost of a traditional study. Yet, one impediment to citizen science projects is the question of how to train participants. The traditional \"in-person\" training model, while effective, can be cost prohibitive as the spatial scale of a project increases. To explore possible solutions, we analyze three training models: 1) in-person, 2) app-based video, and 3) app-based text/images in the context of invasive plant identification in Massachusetts. Encouragingly, we find that participants who received video training were as successful at invasive plant identification as those trained in-person, while those receiving just text/images were less successful. This finding has implications for a variety of citizen science projects that need alternative methods to effectively train participants when in-person training is impractical."

      "Is physiological performance a suitable proxy of fitness in plants? Although, several studies have been conducted to measure some fitness-related traits and physiological performance, direct assessments are seldom found in the literature. Here, we assessed the physiology-fitness relationship using second-generation individuals of the invasive plant species Taraxacum officinale from 17 localities distributed in five continents. Specifically, we tested if i) the maximum quantum yield is a good predictor for seed-output ii) whether this physiology-fitness relationship can be modified by environmental heterogeneity, and iii) if this relationship has an adaptive consequence for T. officinale individuals from different localities. Overall, we found a significant positive relationship between the maximum quantum yield and fitness for all localities evaluated, but this relationship decreased in T. officinale individuals from localities with greater environmental heterogeneity. Finally, we found that those individuals from localities where environmental conditions are highly seasonal performed better under heterogeneous environmental conditions. Contrarily, under homogeneous controlled conditions, those individuals from localities with low environmental seasonality performed much better. In conclusion, our results suggest that the maximum quantum yield seem to be good predictors for plant fitness. We suggest that rapid measurements, such as those obtained from the maximum quantum yield, could provide a straightforward proxy of individual's fitness in changing environments."

      "Species climate requirements are useful for predicting their geographic distribution. It is often assumed that the niche requirements for invasive plants are conserved during invasion, especially when the invaded regions share similar climate conditions. California and central Chile have a remarkable degree of convergence in their vegetation structure, and a similar Mediterranean climate. Such similarities make these geographic areas an interesting natural experiment for testing climatic niche dynamics and the equilibrium of invasive species in a new environment. We tested to see if the climatic niche of Eschscholzia californica is conserved in the invaded range (central Chile), and we assessed whether the invasion process has reached a biogeographical equilibrium, i.e., occupy all the suitable geographic locations that have suitable conditions under native niche requirements. We compared the climatic niche in the native and invaded ranges as well as the projected potential geographic distribution in the invaded range. In order to compare climatic niches, we conducted a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Species Distribution Models (SDMs), to estimate E. californica's potential geographic distribution. We also used SDMs to predict altitudinal distribution limits in central Chile. Our results indicated that the climatic niche occupied by E. californica in the invaded range is firmly conserved, occupying a subset of the native climatic niche but leaving a substantial fraction of it unfilled. Comparisons of projected SDMs for central Chile indicate a similarity, yet the projection from native range predicted a larger geographic distribution in central Chile compared to the prediction of the model constructed for central Chile. The projected niche occupancy profile from California predicted a higher mean elevation than that projected from central Chile. We concluded that the invasion process of E. californica in central Chile is consistent with climatic niche conservatism but there is potential for further expansion in Chile."

      "The widespread invasion of the nonmycorrhizal biennial plant, Alliaria petiolata in North America is hypothesized to be facilitated by the production of novel biochemical weapons that suppress the growth of mycorrhizal fungi. As a result, A. petiolata is expected to be a strong competitor against plant species that rely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake services. If A. petiolata is also a strong competitor for soil resources, it should deplete nutrients to levels lower than can be tolerated by weaker competitors. Because the negative effect of losing the fungal symbiont for mycorrhizal plants is greatest when nutrients are low, the ability of A. petiolata to simultaneously suppress fungi and efficiently take up soil nutrients should further strengthen its competitive ability against mycorrhizal plants. To test this hypothesis, we grew 27 mycorrhizal tree, forb and grass species that are representative of invaded habitats in the absence or presence of competition with A. petiolata in soils that had previously been experimentally planted with the invader or left as a control. A history of A. petiolata in soil reduced plant available forms of nitrogen by >50% and phosphorus by 17% relative to control soil. Average mycorrhizal colonization of competitor species was reduced by >50% in A. petiolata history versus control soil. Contrary to expectations, competition between A. petiolata and other species was stronger in control than history soil. The invader suppressed the biomass of 70% of competitor species in control soil but only 26% of species in history soil. In addition, A. petiolata biomass was reduced by 56% in history versus control soil, whereas the average biomass of competitor species was reduced by 15%. Thus, our results suggest that the negative effect of nutrient depletion on A. petiolata was stronger than the negative effect of suppressing mycorrhizal colonization on competitor species. These findings indicate that the inhibitory potential of A. petiolata on competitor species via mycorrhizal suppression is not enhanced under nutrient limitation."

      "Research on biological invasions has increased rapidly over the past 30 years, generating numerous explanations of how species become invasive. While the mechanisms of invasive species establishment are well studied, the mechanisms driving abundance patterns (i.e. patterns of population density and population size) remain poorly understood. It is assumed that invasive species typically have higher abundances in their new environments than in their native ranges, and patterns of invasive species abundance differ between invaded regions. To explain differences in invasive species abundance, we propose the Human Release Hypothesis. In parallel to the established Enemy Release Hypothesis, this hypothesis states that the differences in abundance of invasive species are found between regions because population expansion is reduced in some regions through continuous land management and associated cutting of the invasive species. The Human Release Hypothesis does not negate other important drivers of species invasions, but rather should be considered as a potentially important complementary mechanism. We illustrate the hypothesis via a case study on an invasive rose species, and hypothesize which locations globally may be most likely to support high abundances of invasive species. We propose that more extensive empirical work on the Human Release Hypothesis could be useful to test its general applicability."

      "<h4>Background</h4>Opuntia dillenii is an invasive plant well established in the harsh South-Eastern arid zone of Sri Lanka. Evidence suggests it is likely that the endophytic fungal populations of O. dillenii assist the host in overcoming biotic and abiotic stress by producing biologically active metabolites. With this in mind there is potential to discover novel natural products with useful biological activities from this hitherto poorly investigated source. Consequently, an investigation of the antimicrobial activities of the endophytes of O. dillenii, that occupies a unique ecological niche, may well provide useful leads in the discovery of new pharmaceuticals.<h4>Methods</h4>Endophytic fungi were isolated from the surface sterilized cladodes and flowers of O. dillenii using several nutrient media and the antimicrobial activities were evaluated against three Gram-positive and two Gram-negative bacteria and Candida albicans. The two most bioactive fungi were identified by colony morphology and DNA sequencing. The secondary metabolite of the endophyte Fusarium sp. exhibiting the best activity was isolated via bioassay guided chromatography. The chemical structure was elucidated from the ESIMS and NMR spectroscopic data obtained for the active metabolite. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the active compound were determined.<h4>Results</h4>Eight endophytic fungi were isolated from O. dillenii and all except one showed antibacterial activities against at least one of the test bacteria. All extracts were inactive against C. albicans. The most bioactive fungus was identified as Fusarium sp. and the second most active as Aspergillus niger. The structure of the major antibacterial compound of the Fusarium sp. was shown to be the tetramic acid derivative, equisetin. The MIC's for equisetin were 8 μg mL(-1) against Bacillus subtilis, 16 μg mL(-1) against Staphylococcus aureus and Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).<h4>Conclusions</h4>O. dillenii, harbors several endophytic fungi capable of producing antimicrobial substances with selective antibacterial properties. By producing biologically active secondary metabolites, such as equisetin isolated from the endophytic Fusarium sp., the endophytic fungal population may be assisting the host to successfully withstand stressful environmental conditions. Further investigations on the secondary metabolites produced by these endophytes may provide additional drug leads."

      "The ability to predict which alien plants will transition from naturalized to invasive prior to their introduction to novel regions is a key goal for conservation and has the potential to increase the efficacy of weed risk assessment (WRA). However, multiple factors contribute to plant invasion success (e.g., functional traits, range characteristics, residence time, phylogeny), and they all must be taken into account simultaneously in order to identify meaningful correlates of invasion success. We compiled 146 pairs of phylogenetically paired (congeneric) naturalized and invasive plant species in Australia with similar minimum residence times (i.e., time since introduction in years). These pairs were used to test for differences in 5 functional traits (flowering duration, leaf size, maximum height, specific leaf area [SLA], seed mass) and 3 characteristics of species' native ranges (biome occupancy, mean annual temperature, and rainfall breadth) between naturalized and invasive species. Invasive species, on average, had larger SLA, longer flowering periods, and were taller than their congeneric naturalized relatives. Invaders also exhibited greater tolerance for different environmental conditions in the native range, where they occupied more biomes and a wider breadth of rainfall and temperature conditions than naturalized congeners. However, neither seed mass nor leaf size differed between pairs of naturalized and invasive species. A key finding was the role of SLA in distinguishing between naturalized and invasive pairs. Species with high SLA values were typically associated with faster growth rates, more rapid turnover of leaf material, and shorter lifespans than those species with low SLA. This suite of characteristics may contribute to the ability of a species to transition from naturalized to invasive across a wide range of environmental contexts and disturbance regimes. Our findings will help in the refinement of WRA protocols, and we advocate the inclusion of quantitative traits, in particular SLA, into the WRA schemes."

      "<h4>Background</h4>Ceriporia lacerata, a strain of white-rot fungus isolated from the litter of an invasive plant (Solidago canadensis) in China, was little known about its properties and utilization. In this work, the copper(II) biosorption characteristics of formaldehyde inactivated C. lacerata biomass were examined as a function of initial pH, initial copper(II) concentration and contact time, and the adsorptive equilibrium and kinetics were simulated, too.<h4>Results</h4>The optimum pH was found to be 6.0 at experimental conditions of initial copper(II) concentration 100 mg/L, biomass dose 2 g/L, contact time 12 h, shaking rate 150 r/min and temperature 25°C. Biosorption equilibrium cost about 1 hour at experimental conditions of pH 6.0, initial copper(II) concentration 100 mg/L, C. lacerata dose 2 g/L, shaking rate 150 r/min and temperature 25°C. At optimum pH 6.0, highest copper(II) biosorption amounts were 6.79 and 7.76 mg/g for initial copper(II) concentration of 100 and 200 mg/L, respectively (with other experimental parameters of C. lacerata dose 2 g/L, shaking rate 150 r/min and temperature 25°C). The pseudo second-order adsorptive model gave the best adjustment for copper(II) biosorption kinetics. The equilibrium data fitted very well to both Langmuir and Freundlich adsorptive isotherm models.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Without further acid or alkali treatment for improving adsorption properties, formaldehyde inactivated C. lacerata biomass possesses good biosorption characteristics on copper(II) removal from aqueous solutions."

      "Transcriptome sequences are becoming more broadly available for multiple individuals of the same species, providing opportunities to derive population genomic information from these datasets. Using the 454 Life Science Genome Sequencer FLX and FLX-Titanium next-generation platforms, we generated 11-430 Mbp of sequence for normalized cDNA for 40 wild genotypes of the invasive plant Centaurea solstitialis, yellow starthistle, from across its worldwide distribution. We examined the impact of sequencing effort on transcriptome recovery and overlap among individuals. To do this, we developed two novel publicly available software pipelines: SnoWhite for read cleaning before assembly, and AllelePipe for clustering of loci and allele identification in assembled datasets with or without a reference genome. AllelePipe is designed specifically for cases in which read depth information is not appropriate or available to assist with disentangling closely related paralogs from allelic variation, as in transcriptome or previously assembled libraries. We find that modest applications of sequencing effort recover most of the novel sequences present in the transcriptome of this species, including single-copy loci and a representative distribution of functional groups. In contrast, the coverage of variable sites, observation of heterozygosity, and overlap among different libraries are all highly dependent on sequencing effort. Nevertheless, the information gained from overlapping regions was informative regarding coarse population structure and variation across our small number of population samples, providing the first genetic evidence in support of hypothesized invasion scenarios."

      "Wood-decaying Basidiomycetes are among the most efficient degraders of plant cell walls, making them key players in forest ecosystems, global carbon cycle, and in bio-based industries. Recent insights from -omics data revealed a high functional diversity of wood-decay strategies, especially among the traditional white-rot and brown-rot dichotomy. We examined the mechanistic bases of wood-decay in the conifer-specialists <i>Armillaria ostoyae</i> and <i>Armillaria cepistipes</i> using transcriptomic and proteomic approaches. <i>Armillaria</i> spp. (Fungi, Basidiomycota) include devastating pathogens of temperate forests and saprotrophs that decay wood. They have been discussed as white-rot species, though their response to wood deviates from typical white-rotters. While we observed an upregulation of a diverse suite of plant cell wall degrading enzymes, unlike white-rotters, they possess and express an atypical wood-decay repertoire in which pectinases and expansins are enriched, whereas lignin-decaying enzymes (LDEs) are generally downregulated. This combination of wood decay genes resembles the soft-rot of Ascomycota and appears widespread among Basidiomycota that produce a superficial white rot-like decay. These observations are consistent with ancestral soft-rot decay machinery conserved across asco- and Basidiomycota, a gain of efficient lignin-degrading ability in white-rot fungi and repeated, complete, or partial losses of LDE encoding gene repertoires in brown- and secondarily soft-rot fungi."

      "The emergence of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) as linked to land-use changes, especially the growing agricultural intensification and expansion efforts in rural parts of Africa, is of growing health concern. This places an additional burden on health systems as drugs, vaccines, and effective vector-control measures against arboviruses and their vectors remain lacking. An integrated One Health approach holds potential in the control and prevention of arboviruses. Land-use changes favour invasion by invasive alien plants (IAPs) and investigating their impact on mosquito populations may offer a new dimension to our understanding of arbovirus emergence. Of prime importance to understand is how IAPs influence mosquito life-history traits and how this may affect transmission of arboviruses to mammalian hosts, questions that we are exploring in this review. Potential effects of IAPs may be significant, including supporting the proliferation of immature and adult stages of mosquito vectors, providing additional nutrition and suitable microhabitats, and a possible interaction between ingested secondary plant metabolites and arboviruses. We conclude that aspects of vector biology are differentially affected by individual IAPs and that while some plants may have the potential to indirectly increase the risk of transmission of certain arboviruses by their direct interaction with the vectors, the reverse holds for other IAPs. In addition, we highlight priority research areas to improve our understanding of the potential health impacts of IAPs."

      "In a globalized world, plant invasions are common challenges for native ecosystems. Although a considerable number of invasive plants form arbuscular mycorrhizae, interactions between arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and invasive and native plants are not well understood. In this study, we conducted a greenhouse experiment examining how AM fungi affect interactions of co-occurring plant species in the family Asteracea, invasive Echinops sphaerocephalus and native forb of central Europe Inula conyzae. The effects of initial soil disturbance, including the effect of intact or disturbed arbuscular mycorrhizal networks (CMNs), were examined. AM fungi supported the success of invasive E. sphaerocephalus in competition with native I. conyzae, regardless of the initial disturbance of CMNs. The presence of invasive E. sphaerocephalus decreased mycorrhizal colonization in I. conyzae, with a concomitant loss in mycorrhizal benefits. Our results confirm AM fungi represent one important mechanism of plant invasion for E. sphaerocephalus in semi-natural European grasslands."

      "Located downstream of the Yangtze River Delta, the Lake Taihu drainage basin (LTDB) is one of the most developed areas in China. This area currently faces population and development issues, as well as many environmental problems, such as cultural eutrophication, algal blooms, and loss of native aquatic plants. Changes in aquatic biodiversity have received less attention than have changes in terrestrial habitats because relevant observations are lacking. In this study, information from 2010, 2014, and 2018 concerning the transformation of the aquatic plant biodiversity was obtained. The results showed that the dominant aquatic plants have changed from native plants to invasive plants. Aquatic plant biodiversity showed a decreasing trend, which may reduce the freshwater ecosystem function, and anthropogenic activities accounted for these changes. How to prevent the decline in aquatic plants and control the invasion of introduced aquatic plants should be a priority in the management of aquatic plants in the LTDB."

      "The allelopathic effects of different parts of the plant Xanthium italicum Moretti were evaluated by conducting bioassays against two dicot plants, amaranth (Amaranthus mangostanus L.) and lettuce (Lectuca sativa L.), and two monocot plants, wheat (Triticum aestivum Linn) and ryegrass (Lolium multiforum). Leaf and fruit extract possessed the strongest biological activity, killing all seeds of four test species at 0.05 g/mL concentration. Fruits were chosen for further investigation because of their high biomass. This led to the isolation and identification of a phytotoxin-Xanthinosin-a known sesquiterpene lactone. Xanthinosin significantly affected seedling growth of all test species at 160 µM concentration. Cultivating seeds in 800 μM xanthinosin solution resulted in a great decrease in seedling growth of all test species, especially for the two dicot plants, amaranth and lettuce, whose root length was inhibited by 78% and 89%, respectively. By comparison, the numbers were 69% lower for wheat, and 66% for ryegrass, two monocot plants. When treated with 4 mM xanthinosin solution, seed germination of all test plants was almost completely inhibited. The possibility of utilizing xanthinosin as an eco-friendly herbicide was discussed."

      "Comparative studies of invasive, noninvasive alien, and native congenic plant species can identify plant traits that drive invasiveness. In particular, functional traits associated with rapid growth rate and high fecundity likely facilitate invasive success. As such traits often exhibit high phenotypic plasticity, characterizing plastic responses to anthropogenic environmental changes such as eutrophication and disturbance is important for predicting the invasive success of alien plant species in the future. Here, we compared trait expression and phenotypic plasticity at the species level among invasive, noninvasive alien, and native <i>Bidens</i> species. Plants were grown under nutrient addition and competition treatments, and their functional, morphological, and seed traits were examined. Invasive <i>B. frondosa</i> exhibited higher phenotypic plasticity in most measured traits than did the alien noninvasive <i>B. pilosa</i> or native <i>B. bipinnata</i>. However, differential plastic responses to environmental treatments rarely altered the rank of trait values among the three <i>Bidens</i> species, except for the number of inflorescences. The achene size of <i>B. frondosa</i> was larger, but its pappus length was shorter than that of <i>B. pilosa</i>. Two species demonstrated opposite plastic responses of pappus length to fertilization. These results suggest that the plasticity of functional traits does not significantly contribute to the invasive success of <i>B. frondosa</i>. The dispersal efficiency of <i>B. frondosa</i> is expected to be lower than that of <i>B. pilosa</i>, suggesting that long-distance dispersal is likely not a critical factor in determining invasive success."

      "Invasive species cause ecological, economic and social impacts and are key drivers of global change. This is the case for the genus Prosopis (mesquite; Fabaceae) where several taxa are among the world's most damaging invasive species. Many contentious issues ('conflicts of interest') surround these taxa, and management interventions have not yet sustainably reduced the negative impacts. There is an urgent need to better understand the factors that drive invasions and shape management actions, and to compare the effectiveness of different management approaches. This paper presents a global review of Prosopis, focusing on its distribution, impacts, benefits and approaches to management. Prosopis was found to occur in a 129 countries globally and many more countries are climatically suitable. All areas with naturalized or invasive Prosopis species at present are suitable for more taxa and many Asian and Mediterranean countries with no records of Prosopis are bioclimatically suitable. Several Prosopis species have substantial impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem services, and local and regional economies in their native and even more so in their invasive ranges; others provide multiple benefits to local communities. Management efforts are underway in only a small part of the invaded range. Countries where more research has been done are more likely to implement formal management than those where little published research is available. Management strategies differ among countries; developed nations use mainly mechanical and chemical control whereas developing nations tend to apply control through utilization approaches. A range of countries are also using biological control. Key gaps in knowledge and promising options for management are highlighted."

      "<h4>Background</h4>There are a variety of ways of increasing crop diversity to increase agricultural sustainability and in turn having a positive influence on nearby natural ecosystems. Competitive crops may provide potent management tools against invasive plants. To elucidate the competitive mechanisms between a sweet potato crop (Ipomoea batatas) and an invasive plant, mile-a-minute (Mikania micrantha), field experiments were carried out in Longchuan County of Yunnan Province, Southwest China, utilizing a de Wit replacement series. The trial incorporated seven ratios of sweet potato and mile-a-minute plants in 25 m(2) plots.<h4>Results</h4>In monoculture, the total biomass, biomass of adventitious root, leafstalk length, and leaf area of sweet potato were all higher than those of mile-a-minute, and in mixed culture the plant height, branch, leaf, stem node, adventitious root, flowering and biomass of mile-a-minute were suppressed significantly (P < 0.05). The relative yield (RY) of mile-a-minute and sweet potato was less than 1.0 in mixed culture, indicating that intraspecific competition was less than interspecific competition. The competitive balance index of sweet potato demonstrated a higher competitive ability than mile-a-minute. Except pH, other soil nutrient contents of initial soil (CK) were significantly higher than those of seven treatments. The concentrations of soil organic matter, total N, total K, available N, available P, available K, exchange Ca, exchange Mg, available Mn, and available B were significantly greater (P < 0.05) in mile-a-minute monoculture soil than in sweet potato monoculture soil, and were reduced by the competition of sweet potato in the mixture.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Evidently sweet potato has a competitive advantage in terms of plant growth characteristics and greater absorption of soil nutrients. Thus, planting sweet potato is a promising technique for reducing infestations of mile-a-minute, providing weed management benefits and economic returns from harvest of sweet potatoes. This study also shows the potential value of replacement control methods which may apply to other crop-weed systems or invaded natural ecosystems."

      "The future spread and impact of an introduced species will depend on how it adapts to the abiotic and biotic conditions encountered in its new range, so the potential for rapid evolution subsequent to species introduction is a critical, evolutionary dimension of invasion biology. Using a resurrection approach, we provide a direct test for change over time within populations in a species' introduced range, in the Asian shade annual Polygonum cespitosum. We document, over an 11-year period, the evolution of increased reproductive output as well as greater physiological and root-allocational plasticity in response to the more open, sunny conditions found in the North American range in which the species has become invasive. These findings show that extremely rapid adaptive modifications to ecologically-important traits and plastic expression patterns can evolve subsequent to a species' introduction, within populations established in its introduced range. This study is one of the first to directly document evolutionary change in adaptive plasticity. Such rapid evolutionary changes can facilitate the spread of introduced species into novel habitats and hence contribute to their invasive success in a new range. The data also reveal how evolutionary trajectories can differ among populations in ways that can influence invasion dynamics."

      "Phenotypic plasticity has long been suspected to allow invasive species to expand their geographic range across large-scale environmental gradients. We tested this possibility in Australia using a continental scale survey of the invasive tree Parkinsonia aculeata (Fabaceae) in twenty-three sites distributed across four climate regions and three habitat types. Using tree-level responses, we detected a trade-off between seed mass and seed number across the moisture gradient. Individual trees plastically and reversibly produced many small seeds at dry sites or years, and few big seeds at wet sites and years. Bigger seeds were positively correlated with higher seed and seedling survival rates. The trade-off, the relation between seed mass, seed and seedling survival, and other fitness components of the plant life-cycle were integrated within a matrix population model. The model confirms that the plastic response resulted in average fitness benefits across the life-cycle. Plasticity resulted in average fitness being positively maintained at the wet and dry range margins where extinction risks would otherwise have been high (\"Jack-of-all-Trades\" strategy JT), and fitness being maximized at the species range centre where extinction risks were already low (\"Master-of-Some\" strategy MS). The resulting hybrid \"Jack-and-Master\" strategy (JM) broadened the geographic range and amplified average fitness in the range centre. Our study provides the first empirical evidence for a JM species. It also confirms mechanistically the importance of phenotypic plasticity in determining the size, the shape and the dynamic of a species distribution. The JM allows rapid and reversible phenotypic responses to new or changing moisture conditions at different scales, providing the species with definite advantages over genetic adaptation when invading diverse and variable environments. Furthermore, natural selection pressure acting on phenotypic plasticity is predicted to result in maintenance of the JT and strengthening of the MS, further enhancing the species invasiveness in its range centre."

      "Most research on the genetics of invasive plant species has focused on analyzing spatial differences among existing populations. Using a long-established Gunnera tinctoria population from Ireland, we evaluated the potential of using plants derived from seeds associated with different soil layers to track genetic variation through time. This species and site were chosen because (1) G. tinctoria produces a large and persistent seed bank; (2) it has been present in this locality, Sraheens, for ∼90 years; (3) the soil is largely undisturbed; and (4) the soil's age can be reliably determined radiometrically at different depths. Amplified fragment length polymorphic markers (AFLPs) were used to assess differences in the genetic structure of 75 individuals sampled from both the standing population and from four soil layers, which spanned 18 cm (estimated at ∼90 years based on (210)Pb and (137)Cs dating). While there are difficulties in interpreting such data, including accounting for the effects of selection, seed loss, and seed migration, a clear pattern of lower total allele counts, percentage polymorphic loci, and genetic diversity was observed in deeper soils. The greatest percentage increase in the measured genetic variables occurred prior to the shift from the lag to the exponential range expansion phases and may be of adaptive significance. These findings highlight that seed banks in areas with long-established invasive populations can contain valuable genetic information relating to invasion processes and as such, should not be overlooked."

      "The mechanisms causing invasive species impact are rarely empirically tested, limiting our ability to understand and predict subsequent changes in invaded plant communities. Invader disruption of native mutualistic interactions is a mechanism expected to have negative effects on native plant species. Specifically, disruption of native plant-fungal mutualisms may provide non-mycorrhizal plant invaders an advantage over mycorrhizal native plants. Invasive Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard) produces secondary chemicals toxic to soil microorganisms including mycorrhizal fungi, and is known to induce physiological stress and reduce population growth rates of native forest understory plant species. Here, we report on a 11-yr manipulative field experiment in replicated forest plots testing if the effects of removal of garlic mustard on the plant community support the mutualism disruption hypothesis within the entire understory herbaceous community. We compare community responses for two functional groups: the mycorrhizal vs. the non-mycorrhizal plant communities. Our results show that garlic mustard weeding alters the community composition, decreases community evenness, and increases the abundance of understory herbs that associate with mycorrhizal fungi. Conversely, garlic mustard has no significant effects on the non-mycorrhizal plant community. Consistent with the mutualism disruption hypothesis, our results demonstrate that allelochemical producing invaders modify the plant community by disproportionately impacting mycorrhizal plant species. We also demonstrate the importance of incorporating causal mechanisms of biological invasion to elucidate patterns and predict community-level responses."

      "Phytophthora ramorum, an invasive plant pathogen of unknown origin, causes considerable and widespread damage in plant industries and natural ecosystems of the USA and Europe. Estimating the potential geographical range of P. ramorum has been complicated by a lack of biological and geographical data with which to calibrate climatic models. Previous attempts to do so, using either invaded range data or surrogate species approaches, have delivered varying results. A simulation model was developed using CLIMEX to estimate the global climate suitability patterns for establishment of P. ramorum. Growth requirements and stress response parameters were derived from ecophysiological laboratory observations and site-level transmission and disease factors related to climate data in the field. Geographical distribution data from the USA (California and Oregon) and Norway were reserved from model-fitting and used to validate the models. The model suggests that the invasion of P. ramorum in both North America and Europe is still in its infancy and that it is presently occupying a small fraction of its potential range. Phytophthora ramorum appears to be climatically suited to large areas of Africa, Australasia and South America, where it could cause biodiversity and economic losses in plant industries and natural ecosystems with susceptible hosts if introduced."

      "In the wake of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the world has woken up to the importance of biosecurity and the need to manage international borders. Yet strong sectorial identities exist within biosecurity that are associated with specific international standards, individual economic interests, specific research communities, and unique stakeholder involvement. Despite considerable research addressing human, animal, plant, and environmental health, the science connections between these sectors remain quite limited. One Biosecurity aims to address these limitations at global, national, and local scales. It is an interdisciplinary approach to biosecurity policy and research that builds on the interconnections between human, animal, plant, and environmental health to effectively prevent and mitigate the impacts of invasive alien species. It provides an integrated perspective to address the many biosecurity risks that transcend the traditional boundaries of health, agriculture, and the environment. Individual invasive alien plant and animal species often have multiple impacts across sectors: as hosts of zoonotic parasites, vectors of pathogens, pests of agriculture or forestry, as well as threats to biodiversity and ecosystem function. It is time these risks were addressed in a systematic way. One Biosecurity is essential to address several major sociological and environmental challenges to biosecurity: climate change, increasing urbanisation, agricultural intensification, human global mobility, loss of technical capability as well as public resistance to pesticides and vaccines. One Biosecurity will require the bringing together of taxonomists, population biologists, modellers, economists, chemists, engineers, and social scientists to engage in a new agenda that is shaped by politics, legislation, and public perceptions."

      "Secondary metabolites released by invasive plants can increase their competitive ability by affecting native plants, herbivores, and pathogens at the invaded land. Whether these secondary metabolites affect the invasive plant itself, directly or indirectly through microorganisms, however, has not been well documented. Here we tested whether activated carbon (AC), a well-known absorbent for secondary metabolites, affect arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbioses and competitive ability in an invasive plant. We conducted three experiments (experiments 1-3) with the invasive forb Solidago canadensis and the native Kummerowia striata. Experiment 1 determined whether AC altered soil properties, levels of the main secondary metabolites in the soil, plant growth, and AMF communities associated with S. canadensis and K. striata. Experiment 2 determined whether AC affected colonization of S. canadensis by five AMF, which were added to sterilized soil. Experiment 3 determined the competitive ability of S. canadensis in the presence and absence of AMF and AC. In experiment 1, AC greatly decreased the concentrations of the main secondary metabolites in soil, and the changes in concentrations were closely related with the changes of AMF in S. canadensis roots. In experiment 2, AC inhibited the AMF Glomus versiforme and G. geosporum but promoted G. mosseae and G. diaphanum in the soil and also in S. canadensis roots. In experiment 3, AC reduced S. canadensis competitive ability in the presence but not in the absence of AMF. Our results provided indirect evidence that the secondary metabolites (which can be absorbed by AC) of the invasive plant S. canadensis may promote S. canadensis competitiveness by enhancing its own AMF symbionts."

      "Invasive plants and agricultural weeds are a ubiquitous and ever-expanding threat to biosecurity, biodiversity and ecosystem services. Many of these species are known to succeed through rapid adaptation to biotic and abiotic stress regimes, often in highly disturbed systems. Given the current state of evidence for selection of weedy genotypes via primary physiological stresses like drought, flooding, heat, cold and nutrient deficiency, we posit that adaptation to land management regimes which comprise suites of these stresses can also be expected. To establish this link, we tested adaptation to water and nutrient stresses in five non-agricultural and five agricultural populations of the invader Johnsongrass (<i>Sorghum halepense</i>) sampled across a broad range of climates in the USA. We subjected seedlings from each population to factorial drought and nutrient stresses in a common garden greenhouse experiment. Agricultural and non-agricultural ecotypes did not respond differently to experimentally applied stresses. However, non-agricultural populations from more drought-prone and nutrient-poor locations outperformed their agricultural counterparts in shoot allocation and chlorophyll production, respectively. We also found evidence for root allocation adaptation to hotter climates, in line with other C4 grasses, while greater adaptation to drought treatment was associated with soil organic carbon (SOC)-rich habitats. These findings imply that adaptation to land-use types can interact with other macrohabitat parameters, which will be fluctuating in a changing climate and resource-needy world. We see that invasive plants are poised to take on novel habitats within their introduced ranges, leading to complications in the prevention and management of their spread."

      "This work investigated eight species of Lepidoptera associated with Miconia calvescens DC. (Myrtales: Melastomataceae) in Brazil, including six defoliators, Salbia lotanalis Druce (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), Druentia inscita Schaus (Mimallonidae), Antiblemma leucocyma Hampson (Noctuidae), three Limacodidae species, a fruit borer Carposina cardinata Meyrick (Carposinidae), and a damager of flowers Pleuroprucha rudimentaria Guenée (Geometridae). Based on host specificity and the damage caused to plants, S. lotanalis and D. inscita are the most promising species for biological control of M. calvescens. Furthermore, if C. cardinata and P. rudimentaria have host specificity in future tests, these caterpillars could also be considered as appropriate biocontrol agents."

      "When alien species make incursions into novel environments, early detection through surveillance is critical to minimizing their impacts and preserving the possibility of timely eradication. However, incipient populations can be difficult to detect, and usually, there are limited resources for surveillance or other response activities. Modern optimization techniques enable surveillance planning that accounts for the biology and expected behavior of an invasive species while exploring multiple scenarios to identify the most cost-effective options. Nevertheless, most optimization models omit some real-world limitations faced by practitioners during multi-day surveillance campaigns, such as daily working time constraints, the time and cost to access survey sites and personnel work schedules. Consequently, surveillance managers must rely on their own judgments to handle these logistical details, and default to their experience during implementation. This is sensible, but their decisions may fail to address all relevant factors and may not be cost-effective. A better planning strategy is to determine optimal routing to survey sites while accounting for common daily logistical constraints. Adding site access and other logistical constraints imposes restrictions on the scope and extent of the surveillance effort, yielding costlier but more realistic expectations of the surveillance outcomes than in a theoretical planning case."

      "The origin of differences in traits influencing competitive success between invasive and native wild populations of alien species is subject of debate. Herbarium-based information sources from 2005 onwards about nativity and distributional range of <i>Phragmites australis</i> were used to survey putative native populations of the species in Quebec, and chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) PCR-RFLP analyses identified only one native population, whereas the same analyses revealed that the Kashmir populations are invasive. We compared the native population of <i>P. australis</i> in Quebec (QN), ten populations invasive to Quebec (QE), and five populations invasive in Kashmir, India (KE) using morphometric traits. Using nine cpDNA microsatellite loci, we also compared nine KE populations, ten QE populations, and the QN population. Phenotypic variation was observed among and within populations. Only dry mass of flowers varied across regions. Characterization of morphotypes defined three distinct haplotypes. A bimodal distribution of stem diameter (SD), internode length (IL), leaf length (LL), and leaf width (LW) suggests that a major gene may control growth traits or occurrence of co-selection. High genetic differentiation was observed between populations (<i>R</i><sub>ST</sub> = 0.353) and haplotypes (<i>R</i><sub>ST</sub> = 0.133 to 0.418), indicating limited gene flow and probable local adaptation. Principal coordinates analysis and the neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree clearly distinguished the three haplotypes. Among-populations phenotypic difference (<i>P<sub>S</sub></i><sub>T</sub>) was lower than overall <i>R</i><sub>ST</sub> for plant height, SD, and fresh and dry mass of flowers and seeds, whereas <i>P</i><sub>ST</sub> estimates for LL and LW exceeded among-populations <i>R</i><sub>ST</sub>, suggesting divergent selection, while local adaptation might have occurred in IL, LL, and flower masses. Genetic drift probably influenced among-populations IL differences."

      "Invasive species are characterized by their ability to colonize new habitats and establish populations away from their native range. In this sense, these plants are expected to have plastic responses to adapt to the environmental pressures during the invasion process. Hence, the role of natural selection is essential because it might favor the occurrence of advantageous traits. However, gene flow can counteract natural selection because immigrants introduce genes adapted to different conditions, with these introductions tending to homogenize allelic frequencies. In this work, we explore the effect of natural selection in invasive populations of S. madagascariensis in Argentina. We quantified leaf area, head number, and length of internodes and inflorescence from material spanning 54 years (1962-2016) and then compared between the edge versus established ranges. Our results show differences in all the measured plant traits among the sampled areas. However, only leaf area was statistically significant, which evidences different responses under the same environmental pressures in the areas located in the edge and established ranges. On the other hand, unlike homogeneous areas, the areas characterized by phenotypically diverse individuals were related to higher dispersal ability. In this sense, long-distance dispersal between neighboring areas may have had an important role in the recorded values. Furthermore, the implications of natural selection and founder effect in the invasion of S. madagascariensis are discussed."

      "Carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus-nutrient and restrictive elements for plant growth and important components of the plant body-are mainly transferred and exchanged between plants and the soil environment. Changes in the carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus eco-stoichiometry greatly impact the growth and expansion of <i>Spartina alterniflora</i>, and understanding these changes can reveal the nutrient coordination mechanism among ecosystem components. To explore the relationship between leaf and soil eco-stoichiometry and determine the key soil factors that affect leaf eco-stoichiometry, we collected leaf and soil samples of <i>S. alterniflora</i> at different tidal levels (i.e., 1, 3, and 5 km away from the coastline) in a coastal wetland in the Yancheng Elk Nature Reserve, Jiangsu province. We measured the leaf and soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus contents and ratios, as well as the soil salinity and soil organic carbon. The results revealed the following. (1) The leaf stoichiometric characteristics and soil properties of <i>S. alterniflora</i> differed significantly between tidal levels; for example, total carbon, nitrogen, soil organic carbon were detected at their highest levels at 3 km and lowest levels at 5 km. (2) Significant correlations were detected between the leaf stoichiometric characteristics and soil characteristics. Additionally, nitrogen limitation was evident in the study area, as indicated by the nitrogen-phosphorus ratio being less than 14 and the soil nitrogen-phosphorus ratio being less than 1. (3) Soil salinity and the soil carbon-nitrogen ratio were shown to be the key factors that affect the eco-stoichiometric characteristics of <i>S. alterniflora</i>. These findings furthered our understanding of the nutrient distribution mechanisms and invasion strategy of <i>S. alterniflora</i> and can thus be used to guide <i>S. alterniflora</i> control policies formulated by government management departments in China."

      "Plant mating systems represent an evolutionary and ecological trade-off between reproductive assurance through selfing and maximizing progeny fitness through outbreeding. However, many plants with sporophytic self-incompatibility systems exhibit dominance interactions at the S-locus that allow biparental inbreeding, thereby facilitating mating between individuals that share alleles at the S-locus. We investigated this trade-off by estimating mate availability and biparental inbreeding depression in wild radish from five different populations across Australia. We found dominance interactions among S-alleles increased mate availability relative to estimates based on individuals that did not share S-alleles. Twelve of the sixteen fitness variables were significantly reduced by inbreeding. For all the three life-history phases evaluated, self-fertilized offspring suffered a greater than 50% reduction in fitness, while full-sib and half-sib offspring suffered a less than 50% reduction in fitness. Theory indicates that fitness costs greater than 50% can result in an evolutionary trajectory toward a stable state of self-incompatibility (SI). This study suggests that dominance interactions at the S-locus provide a possible third stable state between SI and SC where biparental inbreeding increases mate availability with relatively minor fitness costs. This strategy allows weeds to establish in new environments while maintaining a functional SI system."

      "Selecting native species for restoration is often done without proper ecological background, particularly with regard to how native and invasive species interact. Here, we provide insights suggesting that such information may greatly enhance restoration success. The performance of the native vine, <i>Pueraria lobata</i>, and that of the invasive bitter vine, <i>Mikania micrantha</i>, were investigated in South China to test how priority effects (timing and rate of germination and seedling growth) and competition (phytochemical effects and competitive ability) impact invasive plant performance. We found that, in the absence of competition, the germination rate of <i>M. micrantha</i>, but not of <i>P. lobata</i>, was significantly affected by light availability. <i>P. lobata</i> seedlings also performed better than those of <i>M. micrantha</i> during early growth phases. Under competition, negative phytochemical effects of <i>P. lobata</i> on <i>M. micrantha</i> were strong and we found <i>M. micrantha</i> to have lower performance when grown with <i>P. lobata</i> compared to when grown by itself. Relative interaction indexes indicated that, under interspecific competition, <i>P. lobata</i> negatively affected (i.e., inhibited) <i>M. micrantha</i>, whereas <i>M. micrantha</i> positively affected (i.e., facilitated) <i>P. lobata</i>. Higher photosynthetic efficiency and soil nutrient utilization put <i>P. lobata</i> at a further advantage over <i>M. micrantha</i>. Field trails corroborated these experimental findings, showing little recruitment of <i>M. micrantha</i> in previously invaded and cleared field plots that were sown with <i>P. lobata</i>. Thus, <i>P. lobata</i> is a promising candidate for ecological restoration and for reducing impacts of <i>M. micrantha</i> in China. This research illustrates that careful species selection may improve restoration outcomes, a finding that may also apply to other invaded ecosystems and species."

      "Spotted-wing drosophila <i>Drosophila suzukii</i> (Matsumura) is one of the most important invasive pests of fruit and wine production worldwide. This species feeds on <i>Prunus</i> spp., <i>Rubus</i> spp., <i>Fragaria</i> spp. (Rosaceae), <i>Vaccinium</i> spp. (Ericaceae), <i>Vitis</i> spp. (Vitaceae), and other soft fruits. It causes significant damage because, unlike most other <i>Drosophila</i> species, it oviposits and feeds on healthy fruits. <i>Drosophila suzukii</i> is a quarantine pest that is included on the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) A2 List. This species is native to East Asia and has been rapidly spreading through Europe since 2008. Herein, we report the first records of <i>D. suzukii</i> in European Russia. In 2017 and 2020, we placed baited traps in different districts of the resort city of Sochi (Black sea Coast of the Caucasus, Krasnodar Territory, Russia). Three specimens of <i>D. suzukii</i> were collected in June 2017, two specimens in September 2017, and 44 specimens in September 2020. Specimens were identified by the typical female ovipositor, spotted wings of the males, and other morphological characters. Krasnodar Territory is one of the main fruit-producing regions of Russia. Therefore, populations of this pest should be monitored and measures to minimize economic damage should be taken."

      "Native and introduced plant populations vary in leaf physiology, biochemistry, and biotic interactions. These aboveground traits may help invasive plants in competition for resources with co-occurring native species. Root physiological traits may affect invasive plant performance because of the roles of roots in resource absorption. The aim of this study was to test this prediction, using invasive Chinese tallow tree (<i>Triadica sebifera</i>), as a model species. Here we examined carbohydrate (soluble sugar, sucrose, fructose, starch, and cellulose) concentrations and the mass of roots, stems, and leaves, along with root water potential and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonization of soil-cultured <i>T. sebifera</i> seedlings from 10 native (China) and 10 introduced (United States) populations in a common garden. Introduced populations had a significantly greater stem and leaf mass than native populations but their root masses did not differ, so they had lower R:S. Introduced populations had higher soluble sugar concentrations but lower starch and cellulose concentrations in their leaves, stems, and roots. Introduced populations had more negative root water potentials and higher AMF colonization. Together, our results indicate that invasive plants shift their carbohydrate allocation, leading to faster growth and a greater aboveground allocation strategy. Higher AMF colonization and more negative water potential in invasive plants likely facilitate more efficient water absorption by the roots. Thus, such physiological variation in root characteristics could play a role in plant invasion success."

      "Invasive blueberry species endanger the sensitive environment of wetlands and protection laws call for management measures. Therefore, methods are needed to identify blueberry bushes, locate them, and characterise their distribution and properties with a minimum of disturbance. UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) and image analysis have become important tools for classification and detection approaches. In this study, techniques, such as GIS (Geographical Information Systems) and deep learning, were combined in order to detect invasive blueberry species in wetland environments. Images that were collected by UAV were used to produce orthomosaics, which were analysed to produce maps of blueberry location, distribution, and spread in each study site, as well as bush height and area information. Deep learning networks were used with transfer learning and unfrozen weights in order to automatically detect blueberry bushes reaching True Positive Values (TPV) of 93.83% and an Overall Accuracy (OA) of 98.83%. A refinement of the result masks reached a Dice of 0.624. This study provides an efficient and effective methodology to study wetlands while using different techniques."

      "Invasive species have been considered as one of the most serious threats to the biodiversity of various ecosystems, particularly in arid regions. The present study aimed to assess the influence of the invasive shrub <i>Nicotiana glauca</i> on the biodiversity of different habitats in Taif region, Saudi Arabia as well as to determine the highest habitat with seed bank of <i>N. glauca.</i> Soil samples were collected from three locations (Alwaht, Ash-shafa, and Ar Ruddaf), invaded with <i>N. glauca</i>, and analyzed for the soil seed bank. A soil seed experiment was designed in a greenhouse, whereby emerged plant seedlings were left to grow for three months and identified as well as the species density and biodiversity were assessed under and outside the canopy of <i>N. glauca</i>. Also, the floristic composition, life forms, and chorotype spectra of the plant species of the seed bank were analyzed. A total of 42 species, belonging to 23 families, were recorded in the soil seed bank. Asteraceae, Poaceae, and Cyperaceae were the major families (42.9%). The life form spectra of the recorded species were dominated by Therophytes (59.5%). Chorotype spectra analysis revealed that Mediterranean, Saharo-Arabian, and Irano-Turanian were the most represented elements. The species richness and evenness were higher outside the canopy, which indicates a negative effect of the invasive shrub <i>N. glauca</i> on the plant biodiversity in the study area, particularly in Ar Ruddaf location. This could be attributed to the competition or allelopathic effect of <i>N. glauca</i>. In contrast, the density of <i>N. glauca</i> seeds was higher under the canopy compared to outside. The soil nutrients and moisture under the canopy were higher than outside canopy. The present study provides a deeper understanding of the most susceptible habitats or communities to the invasion by <i>N. glauca</i> and thereby open the challenge toward control of this noxious plant and vegetation restoration."

It forms dense thickets up to 4 m high, appearing to displace native vegetation, and threaten the integrity of several native communities. This study used correlation analysis between a R. niveus cover gradient and a number of biotic (vascular plant species richness, cover and vegetation structure) and abiotic (light and soil properties) parameters to help understand possible impacts in one of the last remaining fragments of the Scalesia forest in Santa Cruz Island, Galapagos. Higher cover of R. niveus was associated with significantly lower native species richness and cover, and a different forest structure. Results illustrated that 60% R. niveus cover could be considered a threshold for these impacts. We suggest that a maximum of 40% R. niveus cover could be a suitable management target."

Here, we examined the effects of plant nutrition and defensive chemicals on host preference and performance of adults and larvae of the invasive potato tuberworm, <i>Phthorimaea operculella</i> (Zeller; Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), on four native (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>, <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>, <i>Datura stramonium</i>, and <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) and three new (<i>Solanum melongena</i>, <i>Physalis alkekengi</i>, and <i>Lycium barbarum</i>) host plants. We found that adults preferred to oviposit on <i>S. tuberosum</i> and <i>N. tabacum</i> leaves and the soil around these native host plants over other hosts. Larvae performed well on <i>S. tuberosum</i> and <i>N. tabacum</i>, reaching higher pupa weight and having better survival. Larvae performed poorly on <i>S. melongena</i>, <i>S. lycopersicum</i>, <i>P. alkekengi</i>, <i>D. stramonium</i>, and <i>L. barbarum</i>, with lower pupa weight and lower survival. <i>Solanum tuberosum</i> and <i>N. tabacum</i> had higher leaf soluble proteins than other plants and lower leaf total phenolics than <i>S. lycopersicum</i>, <i>D. stramonium</i>, and <i>L. barbarum</i>. Moreover, carbon content and soluble protein were positively associated with larval survival, while defensive traits (lignin and total phenolics) negatively affected larval survival. These findings provide insights into understanding of biochemical mechanisms of interactions between invasive insects and host plants, indicating the importance of considering plant chemistry when assessing invasive insect host use and damage."

      "Over the past 109 years, a Montana intermountain bunchgrass prairie annually became warmer (0.7°C) and drier (27%). The temperature and precipitation trends continued since 1978, as we studied nitrogen availability, annual aboveground primary production (ANPP), plant phenology and species composition. Given the annual increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation, ANPP might be expected to decline; however, it increased by 110%, as the period of greatest production (late-May-June) became wetter and cooler, counter to the annual pattern, and this was strongest at lower elevations. Grass production increased by 251%, while dicot production declined by 65%, which increased grass relative abundance by 54%. Summer temperatures increased 12.5% which increased plant senescence by 119% and decreased fall plant regrowth by 68%. More intense summer senescence changed plant species composition in favor of more drought tolerant species. The greater ANPP and summer senescence may increase susceptibility for fire, but fire tolerance of the plant species composition did not change. Invasive plant species increased 108% over the study with annual grasses accounting for >50% of this increase, which further increased summer plant senescence. Therefore, seasonal climate changes at a smaller geographical scale (local), rather than average annual climate changes over a larger geographical scale (regional), may better reflect plant community responses, and this makes ecological forecasting of climate change more difficult."

      "ABSTRACT Plant grafting is generally performed between closely related species. Recently, we have discovered that Nicotiana species of Solanaceae show the ability to graft with distantly related plant species beyond the family. Graft adhesion with diverse angiosperms by Nicotiana species was probably facilitated by the secretion of a subclade of ß-1,4-glucanases. The capability of interfamily grafting was also found in the model Orobanchaceae hemiparasitic plant, Phtheirospermum japonicum, which naturally invades to the tissues of host plants of different families. Transcriptome analysis indicated that the same clade of ß-1,4-glucanase plays an important role in plant parasitism. Thus, the tissue adhesion between distant plant species occurs both naturally and artificially. Here, we further observed the capability of interfamily grafting in the stem holoparasitic genus, Cuscuta. These findings indicate that the natural process of tissue adhesion is a potential clue to improve plant-grafting techniques."

      "Abstract Introduced species, which establish in novel environments, provide an opportunity to explore trait evolution and how it may contribute to the distribution and spread of species. Here, we explore trait changes of the perennial herb Lupinus polyphyllus based on 11 native populations in the western USA and 17 introduced populations in Finland. More specifically, we investigated whether introduced populations outperformed native populations in traits measured in situ (seed mass) and under common garden conditions during their first year (plant size, flowering probability, and number of flowering shoots). We also explored whether climate of origin (temperature) influenced plant traits and quantified the degree to which trait variability was explained collectively by country and temperature as compared to other population‐level differences. Three out of four plant traits differed between the native and introduced populations; only seed mass was similar between countries, with most of its variation attributed to other sources of intraspecific variation not accounted for by country and temperature. Under common garden conditions, plants originating from introduced populations were larger than those originating from native populations. However, plants from the introduced range flowered less frequently and had fewer flowering shoots than their native‐range counterparts. Temperature of a population's origin influenced plant size in the common garden, with plant size increasing with increasing mean annual temperature in both native and introduced populations. Our results of the first year reveal genetic basis for phenotypic differences in some fitness‐related traits between the native and introduced populations of L. polyphyllus. However, not all of these trait differences necessarily contribute to the invasion success of the species and thus may not be adaptive, which raises a question how persistent the trait differences observed in the first year are later in individuals’ life for perennial herbs. We explored trait changes in the perennial herb Lupinus polyphyllus based on 11 native populations in the western USA and 17 introduced populations in Finland. Our results of the first‐year reveal genetic basis for phenotypic differences in some fitness‐related traits between the native and introduced populations of L. polyphyllus, but also raise a question how persistent the trait differences observed in the first year are later in individuals’ life for perennial herbs."

      "Nonhost resistance of Arabidopsis thaliana against the hemibiotrophic fungus Colletotrichum tropicale requires PEN2-dependent preinvasive resistance and CYP71A12 and CYP71A13-dependent postinvasive resistance, which both rely on tryptophan (Trp) metabolism. We here revealed that CYP71A12, CYP71A13 and PAD3 are critical for Arabidopsis' postinvasive basal resistance toward the necrotrophic Alternaria brassicicola. Consistent with this, gene expression and metabolite analyses suggested that the invasion by A. brassicicola triggered the CYP71A12-dependent production of indole-3-carboxylic acid derivatives and the PAD3 and CYP71A13-dependent production of camalexin. We next addressed the activation of the CYP71A12 and PAD3-dependent postinvasive resistance. We found that bak1-5 mutation significantly reduced postinvasive resistance against A. brassicicola, indicating that pattern recognition contributes to activation of this second defense-layer. However, the bak1-5 mutation had no detectable effects on the Trp-metabolism triggered by the fungal penetration. Together with this, further comparative gene expression analyses suggested that pathogen invasion in Arabidopsis activates (1) CYP71A12 and PAD3-related antifungal metabolism that is not hampered by bak1-5, and (2) a bak1-5 sensitive immune pathway that activates the expression of antimicrobial proteins."

      "<h4>Background</h4>Fast growing invasive alien species are highly efficient with little investment in their tissues. They often outcompete slower growing species with severe consequences for diversity and community composition. The plant economics trait-based approach provides a theoretical framework, allowing the classification of plants with different performance characteristics. However, in multifaceted background, this approach needs testing. The evaluation and prediction of plant performance outcomes in ecologically relevant settings is among the most pressing topics to understand and predict ecosystem functioning, especially in a quickly changing environment. Temperature and nutrient availability are major components of the global environmental change and this study examines the response of growth economic traits, photosynthesis and respiration to such changes for an invasive fast-growing (Bromus hordaceus) and a slow-growing perennial (Bromus erectus) grass species.<h4>Results</h4>The fully controlled growth chamber experiment simulated temperature-and changes in nitrogen availability individually and in combination. We therefore provide maximum control and monitoring of growth responses allowing general growth trait response patterns to be tested. Under optimal nitrogen availability the slow growing B. erectus was better able to handle the lower temperatures (7 °C) whilst both species had problems at higher temperatures (30 °C). Stresses produced by a combination of heat and nutrient availability were identified to be less limiting for the slow growing species but the combination of chilling with low nutrient availability was most detrimental to both species.<h4>Conclusions</h4>For the fast-growing invader B. hordeaceus a reduction of nitrogen availability in combination with a temperature increase, leads to limited growth performance in comparison to the slow-growing perennial species B.erectus and this may explain why nutrient-rich habitats often experience more invasion than resource-poor habitats."

      "The treatment of patients suffering from <i>Aspergillus</i> diseases is hampered due to infections with <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> that are already resistant to medical azoles. Previous work has suggested that <i>A. fumigatus</i> likely gains resistance through environmental azole exposure in so-called hot spots. Here, we investigated <i>A. fumigatus</i> resistance dynamics over time at three sites at which farmers used azole fungicides for crop protection. Over 16 months, 114 samples were taken from stockpiles of decaying plant waste. <i>A. fumigatus</i> and azole fungicide residues were ubiquitously present in the plant waste. On average, 10<sup>5</sup> <i>A. fumigatus</i> CFU/g was recovered, of which roughly half were itraconazole and tebuconazole resistant. Similar tandem repeat-mediated resistance mechanisms were found in colonies cultured from plant waste as reported in clinical azole-resistant isolates. Our results show a consistent high burden of azole-resistant <i>A. fumigatus</i> in azole-containing plant waste and underscores the need to further investigate resistance-reducing interventions and transmission routes.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> is consistently present independently on season at a high abundance in plant waste material throughout the sampling period. Our study confirmed that long-term storage sites of azole-containing decaying plant material can indeed be considered hot spots, which can sustain resistance development and maintenance in <i>A. fumigatus</i> Roughly half of individual isolates were azole resistant and carried genetic mutations that are highly similar to those found in patients with azole-resistant invasive aspergillosis. Our work suggests that environmental sources of azole resistance in <i>A. fumigatus</i> may be important, underscoring the need for further studies on environment-to-patient transmission routes."

      "<i>Mikania cordata</i>, the only native congener of the invasive weed <i>Mikania micrantha</i> in China, is an ideal species for comparative study to reveal the invasion mechanism. However, its genome resources are lagging far behind its congener, which limits the comparative genomic analysis. Our goal is to characterize the genome of <i>M. cordata</i> by next-generation sequencing and propose a scheme for long-read genome sequencing. Previous studies have shown that the genomic resources of the host plant would be affected by the endophytic microbial DNA. An aseptic sample of <i>M. cordata</i> will ensure the proper genome in downstream analysis. Because endophytes are ubiquitous in the greenhouse-grown <i>M. cordata</i>, the in vitro culture with cefotaxime or timentin treatment was undertaken to obtain the aseptic plantlets. The in vivo mother plant and in vitro plantlets were used to survey the genome. The microbial contamination in <i>M. cordata</i> was recognized by blast search and eliminated from the raw reads. The decontaminated sequencing reads were used to predict the genome size, heterozygosity, and repetitive rate. The in vivo plant was so contaminated that microbes occupied substantial sequencing resources and misled the scaffold assembly. Compared with cefotaxime, treatment with timentin performed better in cultivating robust in vitro plantlets. The survey result from the in vitro plantlets was more accurate due to low levels of contamination. The genome size was estimated to be 1.80 Gb with 0.50% heterozygosity and 78.35% repetitive rate. Additionally, 289,831 SSRs were identified in the genome. The genome is heavily contaminated and repetitive; therefore, the in vitro culture technique and long-read sequencing technology are recommended to generate a high-quality and highly contiguous genome."

      "Prior studies on preferences of native herbivores for native or exotic plants have tested both the enemy release hypothesis and the biotic resistance hypothesis and have reported inconsistent results. The different levels of resistance of native and exotic plants to native herbivores could resolve this controversy, but little attention has been paid to this issue. In this study, we investigated population performance, photosynthesis, leaf nitrogen concentration, and the constitutive and induced resistances of the successful invasive plant, Alternanthera philoxeroides, and its native congener, Alternanthera sessilis, in the presence of three population densities of the grasshopper, Atractomorpha sinensis. When the grasshopper was absent, leaf biomass, total biomass, photosynthesis, and leaf nitrogen concentration of A. philoxeroides were higher than those of A. sessilis. However, the morphological and physiological performances of A. philoxeroides were all decreased more intensively than A. sessilis after herbivory by grasshoppers. Especially as the concentrations of constitutive lignin and cellulose in leaf of A. philoxeroides were higher than A. sessilis, A. philoxeroides exhibited increased leaf lignin concentration to reduce its palatability only at severe herbivore load, whereas, leaf lignin, cellulose, and polyphenolic concentrations of A. sessilis all increased with increasing herbivory pressure, and cellulose and polyphenolic concentrations were higher in A. sessilis than in A. philoxeroides after herbivory. Our study indicated that the capability of the invasive plant to respond to native insect damage was lower than the native plant, and the invasive plant was suppressed more intensively than its native congener by the native insect. Our results support the biotic resistance hypothesis and suggest that native herbivores can constrain the abundance and reduce the adverse effects of invasive species."

      "<h4>Background</h4>There is extensive literature on animal poisoning from plants and mushrooms worldwide; however, there is limited account of poisoning from South Africa.<h4>Methods</h4>This study sought to describe and provide an overview of animal poison exposures in South Africa. Poisoning episodes reported to the Poisons Information Helpline of the Western Cape, jointly run by the Poisons Information Centres at the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital and Tygerberg Hospital over a period of approximately 2.5 years, from June 2015 to November 2017, were analysed to identify exposure patterns, severity and clinical outcomes.<h4>Results</h4>Alien plant species accounted for most cases (n=10) of reported poison exposures. Among the 26 recorded animal poisoning episodes, the dog was the most commonly implicated species (n=24), whereas just two enquiries were related to other animals (one rabbit and one cow). There were 20 plant cases and 6 mushroom cases (all dogs). There was only one fatal case involving cycad in a dog.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Features of animal poisoning in South Africa were similar to those in other countries. The reported cases of animals exposed to poisonous plants and mushrooms could represent only a fraction of the actual exposures. Since most reported cases involved taxa that could not be identified to species level, more attention should be paid in case reporting and in animal poisoning prevention, engaging the public to enable people to recognise potentially hazardous plants and reduce the risk of poisoning in animals."

      "The tomato pinworm Tuta absoluta (Lepidoptera: Gelechuidae) is native to South America and has now become the main tomato pest in Europe, Africa and Asia. The wide range of host plants attacked by this pest has been reported as one of the main reasons for the success of this important insect species. However, the information currently available on the biological performance of T. absoluta on Solanaceae has been obtained from a limited number of host species. The Solanaceae family is composed of thousands of species, many of which are potential hosts for T. absoluta. Our results showed that the highest oviposition rates occurred on cultivated tomato plants, potato and wild tomato. The lowest rates occurred on \"gilo\", \"jurubeba\", green pepper and pepper. The highest survival rates of the immature stages occurred on potato and the lowest on pepper, green pepper and \"jurubeba\". Female fertility, following infestation of the different plant species, was highest for insects that developed on tomato or potato and the lowest rates were seen on American black nightshade. The net reproductive rate and the intrinsic growth rate were highest on potato and tomato. Cluster analysis grouped tomato and potato as highly susceptible to attack, American black nightshade, juá, eggplant, gilo and wild tomato as moderately susceptible, whilst pepper, green pepper and jurubeba were categorized as resistant to T. absoluta. These results clearly demonstrate that the choice of solanaceous host plant species has a direct impact on the fitness parameters of the tomato pinworm as well as survival potential, dispersion and establishment at new sites. These results are important for the planning of integrated pest management strategies."

      "Invasions of non-native species can threaten native biodiversity, and island ecosystems are ideal for studying these phenomena. In this article, first, we report on the invasive species that combine to threaten the island cycad <i>Cycas micronesica</i> by reviewing the history of previously reported invasions and providing an update of recent invasions. Then, we prioritize the threat status of each herbivore and the interactions among them. Plant damage was initiated in 2003─2005 by the non-native <i>Aulacaspis yasumatsui</i> Takagi armored scale, <i>Erechthias</i> sp. Meyrick leaf miner, and <i>Luthrodes pandava</i> Horsfield butterfly, which elicited unprecedented irruptions of the native <i>Acalolepta marianarum</i> Aurivillius stem borer and increased herbivory by feral pigs (<i>Sus scrofa</i> L.). The combined impact of these five consumers represents the greatest sustained threat to the cycad tree species. Mitigation of the damage caused by phytophagous non-native species is urgently needed to conserve this unique gymnosperm tree."

      "Rapid range expansions of invasive species are a major threat to ecosystems. Understanding how invasive species increase their habitat ranges and how environmental factors, including intensity of human activities, influence dispersal processes is an important issue in invasion biology, especially for invasive species management. We have investigated how spatially heterogeneous factors influence range expansion of an invasive species by focusing on long-distance dispersal, which is frequently assisted by human activities. We have developed models varying two underlying processes of a dispersal event. These events are described by source and destination functions that determine spatial variations in dispersal frequency and the probability of being a dispersal destination. Using these models, we investigated how spatially heterogeneous long-distance dispersal influences range expansion. We found that: (1) spatial variations in the destination function slow down late population dynamics, (2) spatial variations in the source function increase the stochasticity of early population dynamics, and (3) the speed of early population dynamics changes when both the source and the destination functions are spatially heterogeneous and positively correlated. These results suggest an importance of spatial heterogeneity factors in controlling long-distance dispersal when predicting the future spread of invasive species."

      "<h4>Background</h4>Globally, and in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa, extreme fires have become more common in recent years. Such fires pose societal and ecological threats and have inter alia been attributed to climate change and modification of fuels due to alien plant invasions. Understanding the flammability of different types of indigenous and invasive alien vegetation is essential to develop fire risk prevention and mitigation strategies. We assessed the flammability of 30 species of indigenous and invasive alien plants commonly occurring in coastal fynbos and thicket shrublands in relation to varying fire weather conditions.<h4>Methods</h4>Fresh plant shoots were sampled and burnt experimentally across diverse fire weather conditions to measure flammability in relation to fire weather conditions, live fuel moisture, fuel load and vegetation grouping (fynbos, thicket and invasive alien plants). Flammability measures considered were: burn intensity, completeness of burn, time-to-ignition, and the likelihood of spontaneous ignition. We also investigated whether the drying of plant shoots (simulating drought conditions) differentially affected the flammability of vegetation groups.<h4>Results</h4>Fire weather conditions enhanced all measures of flammability, whereas live fuel moisture reduced burn intensity and completeness of burn. Live fuel moisture was not significantly correlated with fire weather, suggesting that the mechanism through which fire weather enhances flammability is not live fuel moisture. It furthermore implies that the importance of live fuel moisture for flammability of evergreen shrublands rests on inter-specific and inter-vegetation type differences in fuel moisture, rather than short-term intra-specific fluctuation in live fuel moisture in response to weather conditions. Fuel load significantly increased burn intensity, while reducing ignitability. Although fire weather, live fuel moisture, and fuel load had significant effects on flammability measures, vegetation and species differences accounted for most of the variation. Flammability was generally highest in invasive alien plants, intermediate in fynbos, and lowest in thicket. Fynbos ignited rapidly and burnt completely, whereas thicket was slow to ignite and burnt incompletely. Invasive alien plants were slow to ignite, but burnt with the highest intensity, potentially due to volatile organic composition. The drying of samples resulted in increases in all measures of flammability that were comparable among vegetation groups. Flammability, and by implication fire risk, should thus not increase disproportionately in one vegetation group compared to another under drought conditions-unless the production of dead fuels is disproportionate among vegetation groups. Thus, we suggest that the dead:live fuel ratio is a potentially useful indicator of flammability of evergreen shrublands and that proxies for this ratio need to be investigated for incorporation into fire danger indices."

      "Understanding the strategies and mechanisms of invasive species could guide their control and management especially in arid ecosystems. This study compares the vegetative and reproductive functional traits of the invasive Mexican poppy (<i>Argemone ochroleuca</i>), in seven habitat types, in southwestern Saudi Arabia. The results showed that the aboveground phenological attributes such as plant height, leaf area, and leaf dry mass attained the highest values in the wadi channels, whereas these attributes attained the lowest values in the mountain ranges. Maximum specific leaf area, root parameters, and all reproductive traits were recorded in the abandoned fields. In contrast to all other habitats, populations from abandoned fields had a greater investment of resources in belowground structures, while the population growing in the wadi channels and mountain ranges habitat allocated more energy to vegetative parts. The plasticity in vegetative and reproductive resource allocation in <i>A. ochroleuca</i> is an important mechanism in determining its colonizing ability in different habitat types and expanding the distribution range. The present data of the functional traits of <i>A. ochroleuca</i> agree with the resource fluctuation hypothesis, where the plant flourished in the abandoned fields that attained the highest values of organic matter and nutrients. Therefore, the restoration of these disturbed habitats could improve the resistance toward invasion by this noxious weed."

      "Biological invasions impact both agricultural and natural systems. The damage can be quantified in terms of both economic loss and reduction of biodiversity. Although the literature is quite rich about the impact of invasive species on plant and animal communities, their impact on environmental microbiomes is underexplored. Here, we re-analyze publicly available data using a common framework to create a global synthesis of the effects of biological invasions on environmental microbial communities. Our findings suggest that non-native species are responsible for the loss of microbial diversity and shifts in the structure of microbial populations. Therefore, the impact of biological invasions on native ecosystems might be more pervasive than previously thought, influencing both macro- and micro-biomes. We also identified gaps in the literature which encourage research on a wider variety of environments and invaders, and the influence of invaders across seasons and geographical ranges."

      "The process of protein translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the initial and decisive step in the biosynthesis of all secretory proteins and many soluble organelle proteins. In this process, the Sec61 complex is the protein-conducting channel for transport. In this study, we identified and characterized the β subunit of the Sec61 complex in <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> (MoSec61β). Compared with the wild-type strain Guy11, the Δ<i>Mosec61β</i> mutant exhibited highly branched mycelial morphology, reduced conidiation, high sensitivity to cell wall integrity stress, severely reduced virulence to rice and barley, and restricted biotrophic invasion. The turgor pressure of Δ<i>Mosec61β</i> was notably reduced, which affected the function of appressoria. Moreover, Δ<i>Mosec61β</i> was also sensitive to oxidative stress and exhibited a reduced ability to overcome plant immunity. Further examination demonstrated that MoSec61β affected the normal secretion of the apoplastic effectors Bas4 and Slp1. In addition, Δ<i>Mosec61β</i> upregulated the level of ER-phagy. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the importance of the roles played by MoSec61β in the fungal development and pathogenesis of <i>M. oryzae</i>."

      "<h4>Background</h4>Advances in sequencing and analysis tools have facilitated discovery of many new viruses from invertebrates, including ants. Solenopsis invicta is an invasive ant that has quickly spread worldwide causing significant ecological and economic impacts. Its virome has begun to be characterized pertaining to potential use of viruses as natural enemies. Although the S. invicta virome is the best characterized among ants, most studies have been performed in its native range, with less information from invaded areas.<h4>Methods</h4>Using a metatranscriptome approach, we further identified and molecularly characterized virus sequences associated with S. invicta, in two introduced areas, U.S and Taiwan. The data set used here was obtained from different stages (larvae, pupa, and adults) of S. invicta life cycle. Publicly available RNA sequences from GenBank's Sequence Read Archive were downloaded and de novo assembled using CLC Genomics Workbench 20.0.1. Contigs were compared against the non-redundant protein sequences and those showing similarity to viral sequences were further analyzed.<h4>Results</h4>We characterized five putative new viruses associated with S. invicta transcriptomes. Sequence comparisons revealed extensive divergence across ORFs and genomic regions with most of them sharing less than 40% amino acid identity with those closest homologous sequences previously characterized. The first negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus genomic sequences included in the orders Bunyavirales and Mononegavirales are reported. In addition, two positive single-strand virus genome sequences and one single strand DNA virus genome sequence were also identified. While the presence of a putative tenuivirus associated with S. invicta was previously suggested to be a contamination, here we characterized and present strong evidence that Solenopsis invicta virus 14 (SINV-14) is a tenui-like virus that has a long-term association with the ant. Furthermore, based on virus sequence abundance compared to housekeeping genes, phylogenetic relationships, and completeness of viral coding sequences, our results suggest that four of five virus sequences reported, those being SINV-14, SINV-15, SINV-16 and SINV-17, may be associated to viruses actively replicating in the ant S. invicta.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The present study expands our knowledge about viral diversity associated with S. invicta in introduced areas with potential to be used as biological control agents, which will require further biological characterization."

      "Multiple national and international trends and drivers are radically changing what biological security means for the United Kingdom (UK). New technologies present novel opportunities and challenges, and globalisation has created new pathways and increased the speed, volume and routes by which organisms can spread. The UK Biological Security Strategy (2018) acknowledges the importance of research on biological security in the UK. Given the breadth of potential research, a targeted agenda identifying the questions most critical to effective and coordinated progress in different disciplines of biological security is required. We used expert elicitation to generate 80 policy-relevant research questions considered by participants to have the greatest impact on UK biological security. Drawing on a collaboratively-developed set of 450 questions, proposed by 41 experts from academia, industry and the UK government (consulting 168 additional experts) we subdivided the final 80 questions into six categories: bioengineering; communication and behaviour; disease threats (including pandemics); governance and policy; invasive alien species; and securing biological materials and securing against misuse. Initially, the questions were ranked through a voting process and then reduced and refined to 80 during a one-day workshop with 35 participants from a variety of disciplines. Consistently emerging themes included: the nature of current and potential biological security threats, the efficacy of existing management actions, and the most appropriate future options. The resulting questions offer a research agenda for biological security in the UK that can assist the targeting of research resources and inform the implementation of the UK Biological Security Strategy. These questions include research that could aid with the mitigation of Covid-19, and preparation for the next pandemic. We hope that our structured and rigorous approach to creating a biological security research agenda will be replicated in other countries and regions. The world, not just the UK, is in need of a thoughtful approach to directing biological security research to tackle the emerging issues."

      "Fungal infections affect 300 million people and cause 1.5 million deaths globally per year. With the number of immunosuppressed patients increasing steadily, there is an increasing number of patients infected with opportunistic fungal infections such as infections caused by the species of <i>Candida</i> and <i>Cryptococcus</i>. In fact, the drug-resistant <i>Can. krusei</i> and the emerging pan-antifungal resistant <i>Can. auris</i> pose a serious threat to human health as the existing limited antifungals are futile. To further complicate therapy, fungi produce capsules and spores that are resistant to most antifungal drugs/host defenses. Novel antifungal drugs are urgently needed to fill unmet medical needs. From screening a collection of medicinal plant sources for antifungal activity, we have identified an active fraction from the rhizome of <i>Cyperus rotundus</i>, the nut grass plant. The fraction contained α-Cyperone, an essential oil that showed fungicidal activity against different species of <i>Candida</i>. Interestingly, the minimal inhibitory concentration of α-Cyperone was reduced 8-fold when combined with a clinical antifungal drug, fluconazole, indicating its antifungal synergistic potential and could be useful for combination therapy. Furthermore, α-Cyperone affected the synthesis of the capsule in <i>Cryp. neoformans</i>, a causative agent of fungal meningitis in humans. Further work on mechanistic understanding of α-Cyperone against fungal virulence could help develop a novel antifungal agent for drug-resistant fungal pathogens."

      "Transportation infrastructure, such as railways, roads and power lines, contribute to national and regional economic, social and cultural growth and integration. Kenya, with support from the Chinese government, is currently constructing a standard gauge railway (SGR) to support the country's Vision 2030 development agenda. Although the actual land area affected by the SGR covers only a small proportion along the SGR corridor, a significant proportion of the area supports a wide range of ecologically fragile and important ecosystems in the country, with potential wider impacts. This study used a qualitative content analysis approach to gain an understanding and perceptions of stakeholders on the potential ecological impacts of the interactions between the SGR and the traversed ecological systems in Kenya. Three dominant themes emerged: 1) ecosystem degradation; 2) ecosystem fragmentation; and 3) ecosystem destruction. Ecosystem degradation was the most commonly cited impact at while ecosystem destruction was of the least concern and largely restricted to the physical SGR construction whereas the degradation and fragmentation have a much wider footprint. The construction and operation of the SGR degraded, fragmented and destroyed key ecosystems in the country including water towers, protected areas, community conservancies and wildlife dispersal areas. Therefore, we recommend that project proponents develop sustainable and ecologically sensitive measures to mitigate the key ecosystem impacts."

      "<i>Solidago canadensis</i> L. is an expansive perennial that forms persistent, species-poor plant communities. It often spreads in fallow areas, displacing native floristic ingredients. Its expansiveness is largely due to morphological features, but it can also be the effect of allelopathic interaction. The aim of the experiment was to investigate the effect of aqueous extracts (decoction, infusion, and maceration) from dry <i>S. canadensis</i> leaves on germination and early growth stages of <i>Raphanus sativus</i> L. var. <i>radicula</i> Pers., in three cultivars: 'Rowa', 'Półdługa', and 'Krakowianka'. In comparison to the control, the percentage of germinated radish seeds of 'Rowa' cultivar was statistically lower on the infusion and macerate. Regardless of the cultivar, the smallest changes in germination were found in seeds watered with decoction, and the largest with macerate. Seedlings length was most inhibited on macerate substrates, and least with infusion. Regardless of the form of the extract, each of them negatively affected the initial growth of radish seedlings. A fresh mass of 'Rowa' seedlings was inhibited by all Canadian goldenrod extracts. In relation to the control, the 'Krakowianka' cultivar was the least sensitive to <i>S. canadensis</i> extracts. The total chlorophyll content was the lowest in the seedlings of the 'Rowa' and 'Półdługa' cultivars germinated on macerate, compared to the control and two others extracts. The percentage of electrolyte leakage depended on the type of extract used and the radish cultivar. The study showed that depending on the cultivar, the aqueous extracts from <i>S. canadensis</i> leaves decreasing of germination and early growth of <i>R. sativus</i>."

      "Robinia pseudoacacia L. is an interesting example of how one plant species can be considered invasive or useful depending on its environment. In the past this tree species was planted for decorative purposes and for wood in Poland. For many years it was recommended in poor and degraded habitats because it facilitated late-successional plant species. The aim of this study was to verify if black locust can still be regarded as a resistant tree species in urban greenery. The health condition of old tree specimens growing along streets and in parks was compared. The occurrence of pests and pathogens on R. pseudoacacia trees was assessed and the content of mineral elements in leaves was examined. The research results showed that the health of black locust trees growing in the urban environment in Polish cities, especially along streets (in comparison to park sites), deteriorated significantly due to the interaction of harmful biotic and abiotic factors. Increased level of toxic metals (Fe, Zn, Pb, Mn and Cd) in plant tissues and the accumulation of pests and pathogens negatively influenced the health of R. pseudoacacia."

      "The enemy release hypothesis (ERH) attributes the success of some exotic plant species to reduced top-down effects of natural enemies in the non-native range relative to the native range. Many studies have tested this idea, but very few have considered the simultaneous effects of multiple kinds of enemies on more than one invasive species in both the native and non-native ranges. Here, we examined the effects of two important groups of natural enemies-insect herbivores and soil biota-on the performance of <i>Tanacetum vulgare</i> (native to Europe but invasive in the USA) and <i>Solidago canadensis</i> (native to the USA but invasive in Europe) in their native and non-native ranges, and in the presence and absence of competition.In the field, we replicated full-factorial experiments that crossed insecticide, <i>T. vulgare-S. canadensis</i> competition, and biogeographic range (Europe vs. USA) treatments. In greenhouses, we replicated full-factorial experiments that crossed soil sterilization, plant-soil feedback, and biogeographic range treatments. We evaluated the effects of experimental treatments on <i>T. vulgare</i> and <i>S. canadensis</i> biomass.The effects of natural enemies were idiosyncratic. In the non-native range and relative to populations in the native range, <i>T. vulgare</i> escaped the negative effects of insect herbivores but not soil biota, depending upon the presence of <i>S. canadensis</i>; and <i>S. canadensis</i> escaped the negative effects of soil biota but not insect herbivores, regardless of competition. Thus, biogeographic escape from natural enemies depended upon the enemies, the invader, and competition. <i>Synthesis:</i> By explicitly testing the ERH in terms of more than one kind of enemy, more than one invader, and more than one continent, this study enhances our nuanced perspective of how natural enemies can influence the performance of invasive species in their native and non-native ranges."

      "The small hive beetle, Aethina tumida Murray, is an invasive pest that has spread globally. Western honey bees, Apis mellifera Linnaeus (Hymenoptera: Apidae), are considered the most important host and infestations can lead to collapse of colonies. Larvae feed on honey, pollen, and brood inside the hive and leave the hive as postfeeding wandering larvae to pupate in the surrounding soil. Other host species include bumble bees, stingless bees, and solitary bees, all of which can facilitate small hive beetle reproduction and are used for greenhouse crop pollination worldwide. Here, we investigated if small hive beetles can complete their life cycle when soil is absent by pupating in plant root-supporting substrates commonly used in greenhouses. Wandering small hive beetle larvae were introduced into containers with coconut fiber, perlite, a mixture of both and stone wool substrates to investigate pupation success and development time. Sand was used as control substrate. In all but one substrate (perlite), small hive beetles developed into adults equally well as they did in the sand. Development time ranged between 23 and 37 d and was not different from that of the control. We showed that small hive beetles can pupate in greenhouse substrates. This could constitute a problem for greenhouse pollination as well as it could facilitate small hive beetle survival in areas which otherwise would be deemed unsuitable or marginal environments for small hive beetles to become established. Our study highlights the opportunistic nature of the small hive beetle as an invasive species."

      "Decreasing floral resources as a result of habitat loss is one of the key factors in the decline of pollinating insects worldwide. Understanding which plants pollinators use is vital to inform the provision of appropriate floral resources to help prevent pollinator loss. Using a globally important pollinator, the honeybee, we show how changes in agricultural intensification, crop use and the spread of invasive species, have altered the nectar and pollen sources available in the UK. Using DNA metabarcoding, we analysed 441 honey samples from 2017 and compared these to a nationwide survey of honey samples from 1952. We reveal that shifts in major plants foraged by honeybees are driven by changes in the availability of these plants within the landscape. Improved grasslands are the most widespread habitat type in the UK, and management changes within this habitat have the greatest potential to increase floral resource availability."

      "The reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst is the most common plant immunity mechanism to prevent pathogen infection, although the exact role of ROS in plant immunity has not been fully elucidated. We investigated the expression and translocation of <i>Oryza sativa</i> respiratory burst oxidase homologue B (OsRBOHB) during compatible and incompatible interactions between rice epidermal cells and the pathogenic fungus <i>Pyricularia oryzae</i> (syn. <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>). We characterized the functional role of ROS focal accumulation around invading hyphae during <i>P. oryzae</i> infection process using the OsRBOHB inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) and the actin filament polymerization inhibitor cytochalasin (Cyt) A. OsRBOHB was strongly induced during incompatible rice-<i>P. oryzae</i> interactions, and newly synthesized OsRBOHB was focally distributed at infection sites. High concentrations of ROS focally accumulated at the infection sites and suppressed effector biotrophy-associated secreted (BAS) proteins BAS4 expression and invasive hyphal growth. DPI and Cyt A abolished ROS focal accumulation and restored <i>P. oryzae</i> effector BAS4 expression. These results suggest that ROS focal accumulation is able to function as an effective immune mechanism that blocks some effectors including BAS4-expression during <i>P. oryzae</i> infection. Disruption of ROS focal accumulation around invading hyphae enables successful <i>P. oryzae</i> colonization of rice cells and disease development."

      "Ecological explanations for the success and persistence of invasive species vastly outnumber evolutionary hypotheses, yet evolution is a fundamental process in the success of any species. The Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability (EICA) hypothesis (Blossey and Nötzold 1995) proposes that evolutionary change in response to release from coevolved herbivores is responsible for the success of many invasive plant species. Studies that evaluate this hypothesis have used different approaches to test whether invasive populations allocate fewer resources to defense and more to growth and competitive ability than do source populations, with mixed results. We conducted a meta-analysis of experimental tests of evolutionary change in the context of EICA. In contrast to previous reviews, there was no support across invasive species for EICA's predictions regarding defense or competitive ability, although invasive populations were more productive than conspecific native populations under noncompetitive conditions. We found broad support for genetically based changes in defense and competitive plant traits after introduction into new ranges, but not in the manner suggested by EICA. This review suggests that evolution occurs as a result of plant introduction and population expansion in invasive plant species, and may contribute to the invasiveness and persistence of some introduced species."

      "Parthenium weed has been invading native and managed Australian grasslands for almost 40 years. This study quantified the potential of selected plant mixtures to suppress the growth of parthenium weed and followed their response to grazing and their impact upon plant community diversity. The first mixture consisted of predominantly introduced species including Rhodes grass, Bisset bluegrass, butterfly pea and green panic. This mixture produced biomass rapidly and showed tolerance to weed species other than parthenium weed. However, the mixture was unable to suppress the growth of parthenium weed. The second mixture of predominantly native pasture species (including forest bluegrass, Queensland bluegrass, Buffel grass and siratro) produced biomass relatively slowly, but eventually reached the same biomass production as the first mixture 12 weeks after planting. This mixture suppressed parthenium weed re-establishment by 78% compared to the control treatment. Its tolerance to the invasion of other weed species and the maintenance of forage species evenness was also superior. The total diversity was five times higher for the mixture communities as compared to the plant community in the control treatment. Therefore, using the suppressive pasture mixtures may provide an improved sustainable management approach for parthenium weed in grasslands."

      "Grassland degradation and the concomitant loss of soil organic carbon is widespread in tropical arid and semi-arid regions of the world. Afforestation of degraded grassland, sometimes by using invasive alien trees, has been put forward as a legitimate climate change mitigation strategy. However, even in cases where tree encroachment of degraded grasslands leads to increased soil organic carbon, it may come at a high cost since the restoration of grassland-characteristic biodiversity and ecosystem services will be blocked. We assessed how invasion by Prosopis juliflora and restoration of degraded grasslands in a semi-arid region in Baringo, Kenya affected soil organic carbon, biodiversity and fodder availability. Thirty years of grassland restoration replenished soil organic carbon to 1 m depth at a rate of 1.4% per year and restored herbaceous biomass to levels of pristine grasslands, while plant biodiversity remained low. Invasion of degraded grasslands by P. juliflora increased soil organic carbon primarily in the upper 30 cm and suppressed herbaceous vegetation. We argue that, in contrast to encroachment by invasive alien trees, restoration of grasslands in tropical semi-arid regions can both serve as a measure for climate change mitigation and help restore key ecosystem services important for pastoralists and agro-pastoralist communities."

      "The red-necked longhorn beetle <i>Aromia bungii</i> (Faldermann, 1835) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) is native to east Asia, where it is a major pest of cultivated and ornamental species of the genus <i>Prunus</i>. Morphological or molecular discrimination of adults or larval specimens is required to identify this invasive wood borer. However, recovering larval stages of the pest from trunks and branches causes extensive damage to plants and is timewasting. An alternative approach consists in applying non-invasive molecular diagnostic tools to biological traces (i.e., fecal pellets, frass). In this way, infestations in host plants can be detected without destructive methods. This paper presents a protocol based on both real-time and visual loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), using DNA of <i>A. bungii</i> extracted from fecal particles in larval frass. Laboratory validations demonstrated the robustness of the protocols adopted and their reliability was confirmed performing an inter-lab blind panel. The LAMP assay and the qPCR SYBR Green method using the F3/B3 LAMP external primers were equally sensitive, and both were more sensitive than the conventional PCR (sensitivity > 10<sup>3</sup> to the same starting matrix). The visual LAMP protocol, due to the relatively easy performance of the method, could be a useful tool to apply in rapid monitoring of <i>A. bungii</i> and in the management of its outbreaks."

      "Rapid global environmental changes could exacerbate the impacts of invasive plants on indigenous plant diversity, especially for freshwater ecosystems characterized by relatively simple plant community structures with low bioresistance. However, the abiotic and biotic determinants of plant diversity in aquatic invaded habitats remain unclear. In this study, we measured four <i>α</i>-species diversity indices (the Patrick richness index, Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Simpson diversity index, and Pielou evenness index) in aquatic plant communities invaded by <i>Eichhornia crassipes</i> in southern China. We also recorded eight environmental parameters of these communities (longitude, latitude, elevation, dissolved oxygen, water conductivity, nitrate nitrogen, temperature, and precipitation), together with nine biotic traits of <i>E. crassipes</i> [abundance, invasion cover, height, total carbon (C) content of the leaves and stems, total nitrogen (N) content of the leaves and stems, and the C:N ratio of leaves and stems]. We then used regression analysis and redundancy analysis (RDA) to determine the dominant factors related to plant diversity. We found that the environment significantly affected <i>E. crassipes</i> abundance, height, coverage, stem carbon, and tissue nitrogen, while the leaf C:N stoichiometric ratio was relatively stable. Increasing longitude significantly increased plant diversity, while elevated dissolved oxygen and precipitation slightly improved plant diversity, but increased elevation caused negative effects. <i>E. crassipes</i> invasion significantly decreased all four diversity indices. Increases in <i>E. crassipes</i> coverage and leaf C:N strongly decreased plant diversity, and increased abundance slightly decreased diversity. Our study indicates that both the changing water environment and the properties of the aquatic invasive plants could have significant impacts on plant diversity. Thus, more attention should be paid to aquatic invasion assessment in lower longitudinal regions with lower native hydrophyte diversity."

      "Invasive alien species (IAS) are one of the major threats to global and local biodiversity. In forest ecosystems, the threats caused by IAS include hybridization, transmission of diseases and species competition. This review sets out to analyze the impact of alien plant species on forest regeneration, which we consider to be one of the key stages in tree ecology for the survival of forest ecosystems in the future. The focus of the study is directly relevant to practitioners, forest managers and the conservation management of forests. With this systematic review, we aim to provide an overview of 48 research studies reporting on the impact and/or management of IAS in European temperate forests. We followed a multi-step protocol for compiling the publications for the literature review, with nine search queries producing a total of 3,825 hits. After several reduction rounds, we ended up with a grand total of 48 papers. We identified 53 vascular plant species having a negative influence on forest regeneration in Central European forests. In total, 21 tree species are reported to be impacted by IAS in 24 studies. The results of the review synthesis show that five impact mechanisms affect the regeneration success of native tree species: competition for resources, chemical impact on regeneration, physical impact on regeneration, structural impact on regeneration and indirect impact through interaction with other species. We identified in our synthesis management measures that have been recommended for application at different stages of biological invasions. The associated costs and required resources of management measures are under-reported or not accessible by reviewing the scientific literature. We can thus conclude that it is very import to improve the links between science and practical forest management. We expect that this review will provide direction for invasive plant species research and management aimed at protecting biodiversity in European temperate forest ecosystems."

      "Trade-offs between performance and tolerance of abiotic and biotic stress have been proposed to explain both the success of invasive species and frequently observed size differences between native and introduced populations. Canada thistle seeds collected from across the introduced North American and the native European range were grown in benign and stressful conditions (nutrient stress, shading, simulated herbivory, drought, and mowing), to evaluate whether native and introduced individuals differ in performance or stress tolerance. An additional experiment assessed the strength of maternal effects by comparing plants derived from field-collected seeds with those derived from clones grown in the glasshouse. Introduced populations tended to be larger in size, but no trade-off of stress tolerance with performance was detected; introduced populations had either superior performance or equivalent trait values and survivorship in the treatment common gardens. We also detected evidence of parallel latitudinal clines of some traits in both the native and introduced ranges and associations with climate variables in some treatments, consistent with recent climate adaptation within the introduced range. Our results are consistent with rapid adaptation of introduced populations, but, contrary to predictions, the evolution of invasive traits did not come at the cost of reduced stress tolerance."

      "The invasive pest <i>Spodoptera frugiperda</i> first emerged in China in January 2019 and has, to date, migrated to 29 provinces and municipalities in China, causing heavy crop damage in large areas. As a response to this invasive species from the environment, some indigenous natural enemies have been discovered and reported after <i>S. frugiperda</i> invasion. In this paper, parasitic flies were collected and identified from <i>S. frugiperda</i> collected in the Yunnan, Guangxi, and Henan provinces and the Chongqing municipality in China. By using both conventional and molecular approaches, we were able to show that all the parasitic flies of <i>S. frugiperda</i> identified in the four regions were <i>Megaselia. scalaris,</i> and that they attacked the pest larvae and pupae. This is the first report on an indigenous Chinese <i>Megaselia</i> species that has parasitic ability against the invasive pest <i>S. frugiperda</i>, potentially providing new ideas for pest control in China."

      "(1→3)-β-glucan (BDG) testing as an adjunct in the diagnosis of invasive fungal disease (IFD) has been in use for nearly three decades. While BDG has a very high negative predictive value in this setting, diagnostic false positives may occur, limiting specificity and positive predictive value. Although results may be diagnostically false positive, they are analytically correct, due to the presence of BDG in the circulation. This review surveys the non-IFD causes of elevated circulating BDG. These are in the main, iatrogenic patient contamination through the use of BDG-containing medical devices and parenterally-delivered materials as well as translocation of intestinal luminal BDG due to mucosal barrier injury. Additionally, infection with <i>Nocardia</i> sp. may also contribute to elevated circulating BDG. Knowledge of the factors which may contribute to such non-IFD-related test results can improve the planning and interpretation of BDG assays and permit investigational strategies, such as serial sampling and BDG clearance evaluation, to assess the likelihood of contamination and improve patient care."

      "Invasive plant species cause a suite of direct, negative ecological impacts, but subsequent, indirect effects are more complex and difficult to detect. Where identified, indirect effects to other taxa can be wide-ranging and include ecological benefits in certain habitats or locations.Here, we simultaneously examine the direct and indirect effects of a common, invasive grass species (<i>Microstegium vimineum</i>) on the invertebrate communities of understory deciduous forests in the eastern United States. To do this, we use two complementary analytic approaches to compare invaded and reference plots: (a) community composition analysis of understory arthropod taxa and (b) analysis of isotopic carbon and nitrogen ratios of a representative predatory spider species.Invaded plots contained a significantly greater abundance of nearly all taxa, including predators, herbivores, and detritivores. Spider communities contained over seven times more individuals and exhibited greater species diversity and richness in invaded plots.Surprisingly, however, the abundant invertebrate community is not nutritionally supported by the invasive plant, despite 100% ground cover of <i>M. vimineum</i>. Instead, spider isotopic carbon ratios showed that the invertebrate prey community found within invaded plots was deriving energy from the plant tissue of C<sub>3</sub> plants and not the prevalent, aboveground <i>M. vimineum</i>. <i>Synthesis and applications</i>. We demonstrate that invasive <i>M. vimineum</i> can create non-nutritional ecological benefits for some invertebrate taxa, with potential impacts to the nutritional dynamics of invertebrate-vertebrate food webs. These positive impacts, however, may be restricted to habitats that experience high levels of ungulate herbivory or reduced vegetative structural complexity. Our results highlight the importance of fully understanding taxon- and habitat-specific effects of invading plant species when prioritizing invasive species removal or management efforts."

      "Following its first detection in North Italy in 2012, <i>H. halys</i> has become a serious threat in many crops, including hazelnut. The present study aimed at investigating dispersal capacity and behavior in relation to host plants of overwintered adults of <i>H. halys</i> before the colonization of hazelnut crop. Research was carried out in four polyculture areas (from 14 to 50 ha) in north-western Italy in 2018, by using (i) pheromone-baited traps, (ii) visual inspection and beating sheet sampling, and (iii) immunomarking-capture technique. The relative abundance of <i>H. halys</i> was similar between and within the study areas, and the early attractiveness of lures to adults after overwintering was confirmed; the host plants near a pheromone trap (less than 5 m) hosted higher numbers of <i>H. halys</i> than the same plant species far away. Hybrid plane, European spindletree, walnut, oak, and European elder were the first plants on which adult bugs were observed to feed. By immunomarking-capture technique, <i>H. halys</i> showed both short- and long-range dispersal from overwintering sites and/or early host plants to wild and crop plants. Marked adults were found in all zones of each area, irrespective of the distance from the protein treatment. Therefore, <i>H. halys</i> movement patterns depend on the ecosystem features, and plant host distribution and availability. This knowledge together with the interaction between pheromone and early host plants might contribute to the management of post-overwintering adults."

      "<i>Andropogon virginicus</i> is an invasive weed that seriously threatens agricultural production and economics worldwide. In this research, dried aerial parts of <i>A. virginicus</i> were extracted, applying Soxhlet and liquid-liquid phase methods to acquire the total crude (T-Anvi), hexane (H-Anvi), ethyl acetate (E-Anvi), butanol (B-Anvi), and water (W-Anvi) extracts, respectively. In which, T-Anvi contains the highest total phenolic and flavonoid contents (24.80 mg gallic acid and 37.40 mg rutin equivalents per g dry weight, respectively). Via anti-radical (ABTS and DPPH), and reducing power assays, E-Anvi exhibits the most potent activities (IC<sub>50</sub> = 13.96, 43.59 and 124.11 µg/mL, respectively), stronger than butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), a standard antioxidant, while the lipid peroxidation inhibitory effect of E-Anvi (LPI = 90.85% at the concentration of 500 µg/mL) is close to BHT. E-Anvi shows the most substantial inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub> = 2.58 mg/mL) on tyrosinase. Notably, α-amylase is significantly suppressed by H-Anvi (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.72 mg/mL), over twice stronger than the positive control, palmitic acid. In the cytotoxic assay, E-Anvi is the strongest extract inhibiting K562 cells (IC<sub>50</sub> = 112.01 µg/mL). Meanwhile, T-Anvi shows the highest prevention on Meg-01 expansion (IC<sub>50</sub> = 91.40 µg/mL). Dominant compounds detected in E-Anvi by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) are identified as flavonoids. However, among four major compounds identified in H-Anvi by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), palmitic acid and phytol are the most abundant compounds with peak areas of 27.97% and 16.42%, respectively. In essence, this is the first report describing that <i>A. virginicus</i> is a potential natural source of antioxidants, tyrosinase and α-amylase inhibitors, and anti-chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) agents which may be useful in future therapeutics as promising alternative medicines."

      "Dense impenetrable thickets of invasive trees and shrubs compete with other water users and thus disrupt ecosystem functioning and services. This study assessed water use by the evergreen Prosopis juliflora, one of the dominant invasive tree species in semi-arid and arid ecosystems in the tropical regions of Eastern Africa. The objectives of the study were to (1) analyze the seasonal water use patterns of P. juliflora in various locations in Afar Region, Ethiopia, (2) up-scale the water use from individual tree transpiration and stand evapotranspiration (ET) to the entire invaded area, and 3) estimate the monetary value of water lost due to the invasion. The sap flow rates of individual P. juliflora trees were measured using the heat ratio method while stand ET was quantified using the eddy covariance method. Transpiration by individual trees ranged from 1-36 L/day, with an average of 7 L of water per tree per day. The daily average transpiration of a Prosopis tree was about 3.4 (± 0.5) mm and the daily average ET of a dense Prosopis stand was about 3.7 (± 1.6) mm. Using a fractional cover map of P. juliflora (over an area of 1.18 million ha), water use of P. juliflora in Afar Region was estimated to be approximately 3.1-3.3 billion m<sup>3</sup>/yr. This volume of water would be sufficient to irrigate about 460,000 ha of cotton or 330,000 ha of sugar cane, the main crops in the area, which would generate an estimated net benefit of approximately US$ 320 million and US$ 470 million per growing season from cotton and sugarcane, respectively. Hence, P. juliflora invasion in the Afar Region has serious impacts on water availability and on the provision of other ecosystem services and ultimately on rural livelihoods."

      "Environments in both biotic and abiotic ecosystems have been affected by the colonization of non-native flora. In this study, we examined the effect of Bidens alba invasion on different land-use types along a coastline in southern China. Bacterial communities in each site were determined using 16S rDNA sequencing, and soil physicochemical properties were analyzed using standard methods. Although our results indicated that B. alba invasion did not have a significant effect on the alpha diversity of bacteria, it caused significant differences in soil bacterial community composition between invaded and uninvaded soil across different land-use types. Beta diversity and several physicochemical properties in forest, orchard and waterfront environments were recorded to be more susceptible to B. alba invasion. A high proportion of the variation of bacterial communities can be explained by a combination of environmental variables, indicating that environmental selection rather than plant invasion is a more effective process in coastal microbial assemblages. By comparing topological roles of shared OTUs among invaded and uninvaded soil, keystone taxa in invaded soil were identified. Acidobacteria was the major phyla involved in the invasive process which could be driven by environmental selection. How key phyla react in our experiment should be verified by further studies."

      "Invasive plant management is often justified in terms of conservation goals, yet progress is rarely assessed against these broader goals, instead focussing on short-term reductions of the invader as a measure of success. Key questions commonly remain unanswered including whether invader removal reverses invader impacts and whether management itself has negative ecosystem impacts. We addressed these knowledge gaps using a seven year experimental investigation of Bitou Bush, Chrysanthemoides monilifera subsp. rotundata. Our case study took advantage of the realities of applied management interventions for Bitou Bush to assess whether it is a driver or passenger of environmental change, and quantified conservation benefits relative to management costs of different treatment regimes. Among treatments examined, spraying with herbicide followed by burning and subsequent re-spraying (spray-fire-spray) proved the most effective for reducing the number of individuals and cover of Bitou Bush. Other treatment regimes (e.g. fire followed by spraying, or two fires in succession) were less effective or even exacerbated Bitou Bush invasion. The spray-fire-spray regime did not increase susceptibility of treated areas to re-invasion by Bitou Bush or other exotic species. This regime significantly reduced plant species richness and cover, but these effects were short-lived. The spray-fire-spray regime was the most cost-effective approach to controlling a highly invasive species and facilitating restoration of native plant species richness to levels characteristic of uninvaded sites. We provide a decision tree to guide management, where recommended actions depend on the outcome of post-treatment monitoring and performance against objectives. Critical to success is avoiding partial treatments and treatment sequences that may exacerbate invasive species impacts. We also show the value of taking advantage of unplanned events, such as wildfires, to achieve management objectives at reduced cost."

      "<h4>Background</h4>Invasive plant species pose a significant threat for fragile isolated ecosystems, occupying space, and consuming scarce local resources. Recently though, an additional adverse effect was recognized in the form of its secondary metabolites entering the food chain. The present study is elaborating on this subject with a specific focus on the Nicotiana glauca Graham (Solanaceae) alkaloids and their occurrence and food chain penetrability in Mediterranean ecosystems. For this purpose, a targeted liquid chromatography electrospray tandem mass spectrometric (LC-ESI-MS/MS) analytical method, encompassing six alkaloids and one coumarin derivative, utilizing hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) was developed and validated.<h4>Results</h4>The method exhibited satisfactory recoveries, for all analytes, ranging from 75 to 93%, and acceptable repeatability and reproducibility. Four compounds (anabasine, anatabine, nornicotine, and scopoletin) were identified and quantified in 3 N. glauca flowers extracts, establishing them as potential sources of alien bio-molecules. The most abundant constituent was anabasine, determined at 3900 μg/g in the methanolic extract. These extracts were utilized as feeding treatments on Apis mellifera honeybees, resulting in mild toxicity documented by 16-18% mortality. A slightly increased effect was elicited by the methanolic extract containing anabasine at 20 μg/mL, where mortality approached 25%. Dead bees were screened for residues of the N. glauca flower extracts compounds and a significant mean concentration of anabasine was evidenced in both 10 and 20 μg/mL treatments, ranging from 51 to 92 ng/g per bee body weight. Scopoletin was also detected in trace amounts.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The mild toxicity of the extracts in conjunction with the alkaloid and coumarin residual detection in bees, suggest that these alien bio-molecules are transferred within the food chain, suggesting a chemical invasion phenomenon, never reported before."

      "Theories and models attempt to explain how and why particular plant species grow together at particular sites or why invasive exotic species dominate plant communities. As local climates change and human-use degrades and disturbs ecosystems, a better understanding of how plant communities assemble is pertinent, particularly when restoring grassland ecosystems that are frequently disturbed. One such community assembly theory is priority effects, which suggests that arrival order of species into a community alters plant-plant interactions and community assembly. Theoretically, priority effects can have lasting effects on ecosystems and will likely be altered as the risk of invasion by exotic species increases. It is difficult to predict how and when priority effects occur, as experimental reconstruction of arrival order is often difficult in adequate detail. As a result, limited experimental studies have explored priority effects on plant community assembly and plant invasions. To determine if and how priority effects affect the success of invasive species, we conducted a greenhouse study exploring how the arrival order of an invasive grass, <i>Bromus tectorum</i>, affects productivity and community composition when grown with native grasses. We found evidence for priority effects, as productivity was positively related to dominance of <i>B. tectorum</i> and was greater the earlier <i>B. tectorum</i> arrived. This suggests that priority effects could be important for plant communities as the early arrival of an invasive species drastically impacted the productivity and biodiversity of our system at the early establishment stages of plant community development."

      "To mitigate the movement of non-native organisms with trade, phytosanitary systems have been implemented within and between countries. In some countries such as Cuba, little is known about the within-state plant health system. To facilitate the development of future trade partnership between Cuba and the United States, agencies need to understand the organizational structure and diagnostic capacity of the Cuban Plant Protection System, identify potential synergies between the United States and Cuban systems, and identify steps towards cooperation. This paper fills this critical void by presenting a descriptive analysis of the plant health system in Cuba. Information was integrated from available literature, informal interviews with Cuban experts, and workshops focused on Cuban policies, risk, and potential collaboration attended by Cuban and American experts. We identify the next practical steps in improving cooperation, including building trust and capacity. Mutual understanding of phytosanitary systems will be crucial for the regional economic and environmental stability of a post-embargo United States-Cuban relationship."

      "African horticulture is seriously affected by fruit flies, both native and invasive. Novel sustainable control methods need testing against the backdrop of smallholder-dominated farming of Africa. We evaluated the potential of male-specific attractants (parapheromones) laced with insecticide to suppress the alien invasive Bactrocera dorsalis and native Ceratitis capitata. In large-scale guava, methyl-eugenol (ME)-bait stations combined with toxic protein baits suppressed B. dorsalis within 8 months but resulted in a resurgence of the displaced Ceratitis capitata. In smallholder farms, intervention using SPLAT-ME laced with spinosad was surprisingly unsuccessful. Subsequent mark-release-recapture experiments showed high dispersal rates of flies, covering many times a typical farm size, leading to a continuous influx of flies from surrounding areas. Several other factors important for intervention were evaluated. SPLAT-MAT-ME dollops remained attractive for over two weeks, although gradually becoming less attractive than fresh baits. Further, competitive displacement was observed: C. capitata selectively emerged from fruits in which B. dorsalis infestation was low. Finally, we evaluated whether ME could be combined with C. capitata male attractants [trimedlure (TML) and terpinyl acetate (TA)] without affecting attraction. Combining male lures did not affect catches directly, although at very high populations of B. dorsalis attracted to ME interfered with C. capitata trap entry. Although ME-based methods can effectively suppress B. dorsalis, they were not effective at single smallholder scale due to the high dispersive propensity of tephritids. Further, competitive release implies the need for a combination of lures and methods. These observations are important for developing control schemes tailored for African smallholder settings."

      "Among candidate treatment options for COVID-19, propolis, produced by honey bees from bioactive plant exudates, has shown potential against viral targets and has demonstrated immunoregulatory properties. We conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label, single center trial, with a standardized propolis product (EPP-AF) on hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients. Patients received standard care plus propolis at an oral dose of 400mg/day (n=40) or 800mg/day (n=42) for seven days, or standard care alone (n=42). Standard care included all necessary interventions, as determined by the attending physician. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement defined as the length of hospital stay or oxygen therapy dependency. Secondary outcomes included acute kidney injury and need for intensive care or vasoactive drugs. Time in the hospital after intervention was significantly shortened in both propolis groups compared to the controls; median 7 days with 400mg/day and 6 days with 800mg/day, versus 12 days for standard care alone. Propolis did not significantly affect the need for oxygen supplementation. With the higher dose, significantly fewer patients developed acute kidney injury than in the controls (2 versus 10 of 42 patients). Propolis as an adjunct treatment was safe and reduced hospitalization time. The registration number for this clinical trial is: NCT04480593 (20/07/2020)."

      "<h4>Background</h4>Plant dispersal is a critical factor driving ecological responses to global changes. Knowledge on the mechanisms of dispersal is rapidly advancing, but selective pressures responsible for the evolution of dispersal strategies remain elusive. Recent advances in animal movement ecology identified general strategies that may optimize efficiency in animal searches for food or habitat. Here we explore the potential for evolution of similar general movement strategies for plants.<h4>Methods</h4>We propose that seed dispersal in plants can be viewed as a strategic search for suitable habitat, where the probability of finding such locations has been optimized through evolution of appropriate dispersal kernels. Using model simulations, we demonstrate how dispersal strategies can optimize key dispersal trade-offs between finding habitat, avoiding kin competition, and colonizing new patches. These trade-offs depend strongly on the landscape, resulting in a tight link between optimal dispersal strategy and spatiotemporal habitat distribution.<h4>Results</h4>Our findings reveal that multi-scale seed dispersal strategies that combine a broad range of dispersal scales, including Lévy-like dispersal, are optimal across a wide range of dynamic and patchy landscapes. At the extremes, static and patchy landscapes select for dispersal strategies dominated by short distances, while uniform and highly unpredictable landscapes both select for dispersal strategies dominated by long distances.<h4>Conclusions</h4>By viewing plant seed dispersal as a strategic search for suitable habitat, we provide a reference framework for the analysis of plant dispersal data. Consideration of the entire dispersal kernel, including distances across the full range of scales, is key. This reference framework helps identify plant species' dispersal strategies, the evolutionary forces determining these strategies and their ecological consequences, such as a potential mismatch between plant dispersal strategy and altered spatiotemporal habitat dynamics due to land use change. Our perspective opens up directions for future studies, including exploration of composite search behaviour and 'informed searches' in plant species with directed dispersal."

      "Proper management of nutrients in agricultural systems is critically important for maximizing crop yields while simultaneously minimizing the health and environmental impacts of pollution from fertilizers. These goals can be achieved by timely confirmatory diagnostics of nutrient deficiencies in plants, which enable precise administration of fertilizers and other supplementation in fields. Traditionally, nutrient diagnostics are performed by wet-laboratory analyses, which are both time- and labor-consuming. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite imaging have offered a non-invasive alternative. However, these imaging approaches do not have sufficient specificity, and they are only capable of detecting symptomatic stages of nutrient deficiencies. Raman spectroscopy (RS) is a non-invasive and non-destructive technique that can be used for confirmatory detection and identification of both biotic and abiotic stresses on plants. Herein, we show the use of a hand-held Raman spectrometer for highly accurate pre-symptomatic diagnostics of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium deficiencies in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). Moreover, we demonstrate that RS can also be used for pre symptomatic diagnostics of medium and high salinity stresses. A Raman-based analysis is fast (1 s required for spectral acquisition), portable (measurements can be taken directly in the field), and label-free (no chemicals are needed). These advantages will allow RS to transform agricultural practices, enabling precision agriculture in the near future."

      "Exotic plant species can evolve adaptations to environmental conditions in the exotic range. Furthermore, soil biota can foster exotic spread in the absence of negative soil pathogen-plant interactions or because of increased positive soil biota-plant feedbacks in the exotic range. Little is known, however, about the evolutionary dimension of plant-soil biota interactions when comparing native and introduced ranges.To assess the role of soil microbes for rapid evolution in plant invasion, we subjected <i>Verbascum thapsus</i>, a species native to Europe, to a reciprocal transplant experiment with soil and seed material originating from Germany (native) and New Zealand (exotic). Soil samples were treated with biocides to distinguish between effects of soil fungi and bacteria. Seedlings from each of five native and exotic populations were transplanted into soil biota communities originating from all populations and subjected to treatments of soil biota reduction: application of (a) fungicide, (b) biocide, (c) a combination of the two, and (d) control.For most of the investigated traits, native populations showed higher performance than exotic populations; there was no effect of soil biota origin. However, plants developed longer leaves and larger rosettes when treated with their respective home soil communities, indicating that native and exotic plant populations differed in their interaction with soil biota origin. The absence of fungi and bacteria resulted in a higher specific root length, suggesting that <i>V. thapsus</i> may compensate the absence of mutualistic microbes by increasing its root-soil surface contact. <b>Synthesis.</b> Introduced plants can evolve adaptations to soil biota in their new distribution range. This demonstrates the importance of biogeographic differences in plant-soil biota relationships and suggests that future studies addressing evolutionary divergence should account for differential effects of soil biota from the home and exotic range on native and exotic populations of successful plant invaders."

      "Sphagneticola trilobata (L.) Pruski is one of the fast-growing malignant weeds in South China. It has severely influenced local biodiversity and native plant habitat. Photosynthesis is the material basis of plant growth and development. However, there are few reports on the photosynthetic transcriptome of S. trilobata. In this study, S. trilobata had a relatively large leaf area and biomass. The gas exchange parameters per unit area of leaves, including net photosynthetic capacity (P<sub>n</sub>), intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> (C<sub>i</sub>), stomatal conductance (G<sub>s</sub>), transpiration rate (T<sub>r</sub>), water use efficiency (WUE), photosynthetic pigment and Rubisco protein content were higher than those of the native plant Sphagneticola calendulacea (L.) Pruski. On this basis, the differences in photosynthesis pathways between the two Sphagneticola species were analyzed by using the Illumina HiSeq platform. The sequencing results for S. trilobata and S. calendulacea revealed 159,366 and 177,069 unigenes, respectively. Functional annotation revealed 119,350 and 150,846 non-redundant protein database annotations (Nr), 96,637 and 115,711 Swiss-Prot annotations, 49,159 and 60,116 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes annotations (KEGG), and 83,712 and 97,957 Gene Ontology annotations (GO) in S. trilobata and S. calendulacea, respectively. Additionally, our analysis showed that the expression of key protease genes involved in the photosynthesis pathway, particularly CP43, CP47, PsbA and PetC, had high expression levels in leaves of S. trilobata in comparison to native species. Physiological and transcriptomic analyses suggest the high expression of photosynthetic genes ensures the high photosynthetic capacity of leaves, which is one of the inherent advantages underlying the successful invasion by S. trilobata."

      "<i>Aspergillus flavus</i> (<i>A. flavus</i>) is one of the most important model environmental fungi which can produce a potent toxin and carcinogen known as aflatoxin. Aflatoxin contamination causes massive agricultural economic loss and a critical human health issue each year. Although a functional vacuole has been highlighted for its fundamental importance in fungal virulence, the molecular mechanisms of the vacuole in regulating the virulence of <i>A. flavus</i> remain largely unknown. Here, we identified a novel vacuole-related protein in <i>A. flavus</i>, the ortholog of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate-5-kinase (Fab1) in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. This kinase was located at the vacuolar membrane, and loss of <i>fab1</i> function was found to affect the growth, conidia and sclerotial development, cellular acidification and metal ion homeostasis, aflatoxin production and pathogenicity of <i>A. flavus</i>. Further functional analysis revealed that Fab1 was required to maintain the vacuole size and cell morphology. Additional quantitative proteomic analysis suggested that Fab1 was likely to play an important role in maintaining vacuolar/cellular homeostasis, with vacuolar dysregulation upon <i>fab1</i> deletion leading to impaired aflatoxin synthesis in this fungus. Together, these results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which this pathogen produces aflatoxin and mediates its pathogenicity, and may facilitate dissection of the vacuole-mediated regulatory network in <i>A. flavus</i>."

      "Spartina alterniflora has widely invaded the saltmarshes of the Yangtze River Estuary and brought negative effects to the ecosystem. Remote sensing technique has recently been used to monitor its distribution, but the similar morphology and canopy structure among S. alterniflora and its neighbor species make it difficult even with high-resolution images. Nevertheless, these species have divergence on phenological stages throughout the year, which cause distinguishing spectral characteristics among them and provide opportunities for discrimination. The field spectra of the S. alterniflora community as well as its major victims, native Phragmites australis and Scirpus mariqueter, were measured in 2009 and 2010 at multi-phenological stages in the Yangtze River Estuary, aiming to find the most appropriate periods for mapping S. alterniflora. Collected spectral data were analyzed separately for every stage firstly by re-sampling reflectance curves into continued 5-nm-wide hyper-spectral bands and then by re-sampling into broad multi-spectral bands - the same as the band ranges of the TM sensor, as well as calculating commonly used vegetation indices. The results showed that differences among saltmarsh communities' spectral characteristics were affected by their phenological stages. The germination and early vegetative growth stage and the flowering stage were probably the best timings to identify S. alterniflora. Vegetation indices like NDVI, ANVI, VNVI, and RVI are likely to enhance spectral separability and also make it possible to discriminate S. alterniflora at its withering stage."

      "Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) dry-cured hams production is greatly dependent on raw meat quality. This study was performed to identify genetic markers associated with the quality of dry-cured ham. Carcass traits of 229 heavy pigs belonging to three commercial genetic lines were registered (weight, EUROP classification). Phenotypic traits (<i>Semimembranosus</i> muscle ultimate pH, ham weight and lean meat content, adsorbed salt) of the corresponding thighs, undergone PDO ham process in three different plants, were measured, using a fast and non-invasive technology. Green ham weight and lean meat percentage influenced the estimated salt content and the weight loss during salting, even if the processing plant greatly affected the variability of the measured ham traits. The genomic data were obtained with the GeneSeek Genomic Profiler (GGP) 70k HD Porcine Array, using the slaughter day and the sex of the animals in the statistical analyses. The phenotypic traits were associated with the genotypes through GenAbel software. The results showed that 18 SNPs located on nine porcine chromosomes were found to be associated with nine phenotypic traits, mainly related to ham weight loss during salting. New associations were found between markers in the genes <i>Neural Precursor Cell Expressed Developmentally Down-Regulated 9</i> (<i>NEDD9</i>, SSC7), <i>T-Cell Lymphoma Invasion and Metastasis 2</i> (<i>TIAM2</i>, SSC1), and the ham quality traits. After validation, these SNPs may be useful to improve the quality of thighs for the production of PDO dry-cured hams."

      "Plant species ranges are expected to shift in response to climate change, however, it is unclear how species interactions will affect range shifts. Because of the potential for enemy release of invasive nonnative plant species from species-specific soil pathogens, invasive plants may be able to shift ranges more readily than native plant species. Additionally, changing climatic conditions may alter soil microbial functioning, affecting plant-microbe interactions. We evaluated the effects of site, plant-soil microbe interactions, altered climate, and their interactions on the growth and germination of three congeneric shrub species, two native to southern and central Florida (<i>Eugenia foetida</i> and <i>E. axillaris</i>), and one nonnative invasive from south America (<i>E. uniflora</i>). We measured germination and biomass for these plant species in growth chambers grown under live and sterile soils from two sites within their current range, and one site in their expected range, simulating current (2010) and predicted future (2050) spring growing season temperatures in the new range. Soil microbes (microscopic bacteria, fungi, viruses and other organisms) had a net negative effect on the invasive plant, <i>E. uniflora</i>, across all sites and temperature treatments. This negative response to soil microbes suggests that <i>E. uniflora</i>'s invasive success and potential for range expansion are due to other contributing factors, e.g. higher germination and growth relative to native <i>Eugenia</i>. The effect of soil microbes on the native species depended on the geographic provenance of the microbes, and this may influence range expansion of these native species."

      "Stemborers (Busseola fusca, Sesamia calamistis and Chilo partellus), the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) and associated parasitoids constitute an interacting system in maize fields in Kenya. This work aims at developing and evaluating models that represent the evolution of those interactions by applying system thinking and system dynamics approaches with its archetypes [causal loop diagram (CLD), reinforcing (R) and balancing (B)] to analyse the population of these multi-species systems. The software Vensim PLE 8.0.9 was used to implement the models and carry out the simulations of single- and multi-species systems. The results showed that when a single pest species with its associated parasitoids interact with the host plant, the species was able to establish and sustain by cyclical relationship between populations of the pest and the associated parasitoids. However, in multi- pest species systems, dominance of S. frugiperda and C. partellus over B. fusca and S. calamistis was observed, but without extinction. However, there was a likelihood for B. fusca being displaced by C. partellus. Overall, the models predict the co-existence of fall armyworm with stemborer species as an additional pest of maize in Africa that need to be considered henceforth in designing IPM strategies in maize."

      "Bees rely on floral pollen and nectar for food. Therefore, pollinator friendly plantings are often used to enrich habitats in bee conservation efforts. As part of these plantings, non-native plants may provide valuable floral resources, but their effects on native bee communities have not been assessed in direct comparison with native pollinator friendly plantings. In this study, we performed a common garden experiment by seeding mixes of 20 native and 20 non-native pollinator friendly plant species at separate neighboring plots at three sites in Maryland, USA, and recorded flower visitors for 2 years. A total of 3,744 bees (120 species) were collected. Bee abundance and species richness were either similar across plant types (midseason and for abundance also late season) or lower at native than at non-native plots (early season and for richness also late season). The overall bee community composition differed significantly between native and non-native plots, with 11 and 23 bee species being found exclusively at one plot type or the other, respectively. Additionally, some species were more abundant at native plant plots, while others were more abundant at non-natives. Native plants hosted more specialized plant-bee visitation networks than non-native plants. Three species out of the five most abundant bee species were more specialized when foraging on native plants than on non-native plants. Overall, visitation networks were more specialized in the early season than in late seasons. Our findings suggest that non-native plants can benefit native pollinators, but may alter foraging patterns, bee community assemblage, and bee-plant network structures."

      "<i>Ailanthus altissima</i> is an invasive alien species (IAS) present throughout Europe and included in the list of alien species of Union concern. In sub-Mediterranean areas of central Italy, there is a lack of knowledge about this invasive species and its interactions with the native forest ecosystems. We aim to find what are the main differences in vegetation structure and floristic diversity between <i>A. altissima</i> forests and native forests through the assessment of the principal ecological parameters that differ between the forest types. We performed 38 phytosociological relevés and sampling of ecological parameters in <i>A. altissima</i> forest communities and neighboring native forests. We analyzed how species richness, diversity, life forms, life strategies, structural characteristics, and ecological parameters changed in <i>A. altissima</i> forests compared with native ones. We found that in <i>A. altissima</i> forests, there is a shift in herbaceous layer richness, with a higher presence of annual ruderal herbs and the absence of herbaceous species linked to the forest environment. The ecological parameters that diverge from the native forests were total nitrogen, total carbon, and C/N ratio. <i>A. altissima</i> forest communities could threaten the biodiversity of the native forest ecosystems in the sub-Mediterranean landscape, favoring ruderal species and inhibiting the presence of typical forest species."

      "Microorganisms surrounding plant roots may benefit invasive species through enhanced mutualism or decreased antagonism, when compared to surrounding native species. We surveyed the rhizosphere soil microbiome of a prominent invasive plant, <i>Phragmites australis</i>, and its co-occurring native subspecies for evidence of microbial drivers of invasiveness. If the rhizosphere microbial community is important in driving plant invasions, we hypothesized that non-native <i>Phragmites</i> would cultivate a different microbiome from native <i>Phragmites</i>, containing fewer pathogens, more mutualists, or both. We surveyed populations of native and non-native <i>Phragmites</i> across Michigan and Ohio USA, and we described rhizosphere microbial communities using culture-independent next-generation sequencing. We found little evidence that native and non-native <i>Phragmites</i> cultivate distinct bacterial, fungal, or oomycete rhizosphere communities. Microbial community differences in our Michigan survey were not associated with plant lineage but were mainly driven by environmental factors, such as soil saturation and nutrient concentrations. Intensive sampling along transects consisting of dense monocultures of each lineage and mixed zones revealed bacterial community differences between lineages in dense monoculture, but not in mixture. We found no evidence of functional differences in the microbial communities surrounding each lineage. We extrapolate that the invasiveness of non-native <i>Phragmites</i>, when compared to its native congener, does not result from the differential cultivation of beneficial or antagonistic rhizosphere microorganisms."

      "In order to investigated diversity and geographic distribitution of rhizobia associated with invasive <i>Mimosa</i> species, <i>Mimosa</i> nodules and soils around the plants were sampled from five provinces in southern China. In total, 361 isolates were obtained from <i>Mimosa pudica</i> and <i>Mimosa diplotricha</i> in 25 locations. A multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) including 16S rRNA, <i>atpD</i>, <i>dnaK</i>, <i>glnA</i>, <i>gyrB</i>, and <i>recA</i> identified the isolates into eight genospecies corresponding to <i>Paraburkhleria mimosarum</i>, <i>Paraburkholderia phymatum</i>, <i>Paraburkholeria carbensis</i>, <i>Cupriavidus taiwanensis</i>, <i>Cupriavidus</i> sp., <i>Rhizobium altiplani</i>, <i>Rhizobium mesoamericanum</i>, and <i>Rhizobium etli</i>. The majority of the isolates were <i>Cupriavidus</i> (62.6%), followed by <i>Paraburkholderia</i> (33.5%) and <i>Rhizobium</i> (2.9%). <i>Cupriavidus</i> strains were more predominant in nodules of <i>M. diplotricha</i> (76.2) than in <i>M. pudica</i> (59.9%), and the distribution of <i>P. phymatum</i> in those two plant species was reverse (3.4:18.2%). Four symbiotypes were defined among the isolates based upon the phylogeny of <i>nodA</i>-<i>nifH</i> genes, represented by <i>P. mimosarum</i>, <i>P. phymatum</i>-<i>P. caribensis</i>, <i>Cupriavidus</i> spp., and <i>Rhizobium</i> spp. The species affiliation and the symbiotype division among the isolates demonstrated the multiple origins of <i>Mimosa</i> rhizobia in China: most were similar to those found in the original centers of <i>Mimosa</i> plants, but <i>Cupriavidus</i> sp. might have a local origin. The unbalanced distribution of symbionts between the two <i>Mimosa</i> species might be related to the soil pH, organic matter and available nitrogen; <i>Cupriavidus</i> spp. generally dominated most of the soils colonized by <i>Mimosa</i> in this study, but it had a particular preference for neutral-alkaline soils with low fertility whereas. While <i>Paraburkholderia</i> spp. preferred more acidic and fertile soils. The <i>Rhizobium</i> spp. tended to prefer neutral-acidic soils with high fertility soils."

      "<i>Ambrosia artemisiifolia</i> and <i>Ambrosia trifida</i> are two species of very harmful and invasive plants of the same genus. However, it remains unclear why <i>A. artemisiifolia</i> is more widely distributed than <i>A. trifida</i> worldwide. Distribution and abundance of these two species were surveyed and measured from 2010 to 2017 in the Yili Valley, Xinjiang, China. Soil temperature and humidity, main companion species, the biological characteristics in farmland ecotone, residential area, roadside and grassland, and water demand of the two species were determined and studied from 2017 to 2018. The area occupied by <i>A. artemisiifolia</i> in the Yili Valley was more extensive than that of <i>A. trifida</i>, while the abundance of <i>A. artemisiifolia</i> in grassland was less than that of <i>A. trifida</i> at eight years after invasion. The interspecific competitive ability of two species was stronger than those of companion species in farmland ecotone, residential, and roadside. In addition, <i>A. trifida</i> had greater interspecific competitive ability than other plant species in grassland. The seed size and seed weight of <i>A. trifida</i> were five times or eight times those of <i>A. artemisiifolia</i>. When comparing the changes under simulated annual precipitation of 840 mm versus 280 mm, the seed yield per m<sup>2</sup> of <i>A. trifida</i> decreased from 50,185 to 19, while that of <i>A. artemisiifolia</i> decreased from 15,579 to 530."

      "<i>Elytrigia atherica</i> is a native invasive plant species whose expansion on salt marshes is attributed to genotypic and phenotypic adaptations to non-ideal environmental conditions, forming two ecotypes. It is unknown how <i>E. atherica</i>-microbiome interactions are contributing to its adaptation. Here we investigated the effect of sea-water flooding frequency and associated soil (a)biotic conditions on plant traits and root-associated microbial community composition and potential functions of two <i>E. atherica</i> ecotypes. We observed higher endomycorrhizal colonization in high-elevation ecotypes (HE, low inundation frequency), whereas low-elevation ecotypes (LE, high inundation frequency) had higher specific leaf area. Similarly, rhizosphere and endosphere bacterial communities grouped according to ecotypes. Soil ammonium content and elevation explained rhizosphere bacterial composition. Around 60% the endosphere amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were also found in soil and around 30% of the ASVs were ecotype-specific. The endosphere of HE-ecotype harbored more unique sequences than the LE-ecotype, the latter being abundant in halophylic bacterial species. The composition of the endosphere may explain salinity and drought tolerance in relation to the local environmental needs of each ecotype. Overall, these results suggest that <i>E. atherica</i> is flexible in its association with soil bacteria and ecotype-specific dissimilar, which may enhance its competitive strength in salt marshes."

      "<h4>Unlabelled</h4>Communities of post-dispersal granivores can shape the density and dispersion of exotic plants and invasive weeds, yet plant ecologists have a limited perception of the relative trophic linkages between a seed species and members of its granivore community. Dandelion seeds marked with Rabbit IgG were disseminated into replicated plots in the recipient habitat (South Dakota) and the native range (Czech Republic). Arthropods were collected in pitfall traps, and their guts were searched for the protein marker using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Seed dishes were placed in each plot, and dandelion seed removal rates were measured. The entire experiment was repeated five times over the dandelion flowering period. Gut analysis revealed that approximately 22% of specimens tested positive for the seed marker. A more diverse granivore community had trophic linkages to seeds than has been previously realized under field conditions. This community included taxa such as isopods, millipedes, weevils, rove beetles, and caterpillars, in addition to the traditionally recognized ants, crickets, and carabid beetles. Rarefaction and Chao analysis estimated approximately 16 and 27 species in the granivore communities of the Czech Republic and South Dakota, respectively.<h4>Synthesis</h4>Generalist granivore communities are diverse and polyphagous, and are clearly important as a form of biotic resistance to invasive and weedy plants. These granivore communities can be managed to limit population growth of these pests."

      "Xanthium strumarium L. (Common cocklebur) is a noxious weed prevailing in different ecosystems around the world. It incurs significant yield and economic losses in different cropping systems globally. Successful management of any weed species depends on sound knowledge of seed germination biology. However, detailed knowledge on seed germination biology of the species is missing. Therefore, we investigated the impact of different environmental factors on seed germination and seed burial depths on seedling emergence of two X. strumarium populations. The impact of different sorghum mulch doses (0-10 t ha-1) on seedling emergence of the tested populations was also explored. Seed germination was evaluated under different photoperiods (0, 12 and 24), constant temperatures (0-50°C with 5°C stepwise rise), and different levels of pH (3-12), salinity (0-600 mM) and osmotic potential (0 to -1.6 MPa). Seedling emergence was observed for seeds buried at different depths (0-15 cm). Seeds of both populations proved non-photoblastic; however, higher germination was recorded under 12-hour photoperiod. The seeds germinated under a wide range of constant temperatures (10-45°C), pH (4-10), osmotic potentials (0 to -0.8 MPa) and salinity levels (0-400 mM NaCl). However, the highest germination was observed under 30-31°C temperature and neutral pH (7.51-7.52). Seeds were able to withstand 400 mM salinity and -1.00 MPa osmotic potential. Seedling emergence was initially improved with increasing burial depth and then a sharp decline was noted for the seeds buried >3 cm depth. Most of the seeds of both populations did not emerge from >8 cm depth. Different sorghum mulch doses linearly suppressed seedling emergence of tested populations, and 5.83-5.89 t ha-1 mulch application suppressed 50% of seedling emergence. Seedling emergence was completely retarded with 8 t ha-1 sorghum mulch. The tested populations germinated under diverse environmental circumstances indicating that the species can become troublesome in marginal habitats and cropped lands. Deep burial of seeds and application of sorghum mulches suppressed seedling emergence. Thus, deep burial followed by shallow tillage and application of sorghum mulches could be used as a successful strategy to manage the species in agricultural fields. Nonetheless, management strategies must be developed to control the species in other habitats."

      "Pests and diseases introduced from other countries are known to pose a threat to trees, woods and forests in many locations throughout the world. Once introduced they can be spread inadvertently by countryside visitors hiking, biking or riding along paths and trails through wooded areas. Engaging and communicating with these groups of countryside users to encourage and facilitate positive biosecurity behaviours is crucial for the future resilience of trees, woods and forests. This review draws on literature outlining principles for stakeholder engagement in forestry as well as evaluations of biosecurity campaigns from around the world. Key points are briefly presented for communicators aiming to encourage better biosecurity in the countryside. These include, the need to design campaigns based on the values and motivations of recreationists, using trusted information sources and understanding the importance of combining information with facilities so as to reduce the cost (in terms of effort and inconvenience) to hikers and other countryside users."

      "We measured 34 years of plant community change in a degraded oak woodland undergoing ecological management. Management included regular prescribed fire, control of white-tailed deer populations, repeated sowing of a diverse seed mix, and removal of invasive plants. We tracked change with several conservation metrics. Time series analysis showed no significant changes over time in either plant species richness or the Shannon-Weiner diversity index. Floristic Quality Assessment measures-the Floristic Quality Index (FQI), Cover-weighted FQI, and the Mean Coefficient of Conservatism (Mean C)-all increased dramatically over time, such that their values now surpass those of the highest quality representative of this habitat in the region. Cover-weighted FQI had the added benefit of being quick to respond (negatively and positively) to short-term management changes during the study. This sensitivity highlights its utility for adaptive management, enabling timely, data-driven changes to ongoing management regimes. Plant community composition showed striking changes during the study period, as species of high conservation value replaced weedier species. As a group, conservative woodland species are notoriously slow to recover from degradation, making this flora's recovery particularly notable. A mid-study cessation of management immediately stalled the woodland's recovery according to Floristic Quality metrics, but the restoration quickly returned to its positive trajectory with the resumption of management treatments. These results illustrate that impressive plant biodiversity restoration can be achieved, even in highly degraded contemporary oak ecosystems, if ecological management is comprehensive and if it is sustained over time."

      "In the process of biological invasion, hybridization between invasive species and native species is very common, which may lead to the formation of hybrids with a stronger adaptability. The hybrid of <i>Wedelia trilobata</i> (an alien invasive species) and <i>Wedelia chinensis</i> (an indigenous congener) has been found in South China. In our previous study, we found that the hybrid showed heterosis under cadmium stress. However, the results of this experiment demonstrated that the leaves of the hybrid had no heterosis in controlling water loss. The results showed that the water loss rate of <i>W. trilobata</i> was the slowest, that of <i>W. chinensis</i> was the fastest, and that of the hybrid was in the middle. Compared with <i>W. chinensis</i> and the hybrid, <i>W. trilobata</i> accumulated more abscisic acid (ABA) in leaves to control water loss. After the leaves were detached, <i>W. chinensis</i> leaves suffered the most serious damage, the lowest maximum photochemical efficiency, the most serious membrane lipid peroxidation, and the largest accumulation of malondialdehyde and reactive oxygen species. Compared with <i>W. chinensis</i> and its hybrid, the leaves of <i>W. trilobata</i> could accumulate more antioxidant enzymes and antioxidants, and the total antioxidant capacity was the strongest. The results demonstrate that the ability of the hybrid to reduce water loss was lower than that of <i>W. trilobata</i>, but higher than that of <i>W. chinensis</i>. They showed that the drought resistance of the hybrid may be higher than that of <i>W. chinensis</i>, and it might threaten the survival of <i>W. chinensis</i>."

      "The expansion of woody plants into grasslands and old fields is often ascribed to fire suppression and heavy grazing, especially by domestic livestock. However, it is also recognized that nutrient availability and interspecific competition with grasses and other woody plants play a role in certain habitats. I examined potential factors causing range- and niche expansion by the eastern redcedar Juniperus virginiana, the most widespread conifer in the eastern United States, in multifactorial experiments in a greenhouse. Historical records suggest that the eastern redcedar is a pioneer forest species, and may be replaced as the forest increases in tree density due to shading. Another possible factor that affects its distribution may be nutrient availability, which is higher in old fields and other disturbed lands than in undisturbed habitats. In its historic range, eastern redcedars are particularly abundant on limestone outcrops, often termed 'cedar barrens'. However, the higher abundance on limestone could be due to reduced interspecific competition rather than a preference for high pH substrates. I manipulated shade, fertilization, lime, and interspecific competition with a common dominant tree, the post oak Quercus stellata. In a separate experiment, I manipulated fire and grass competition. I measured growth rates (height and diameter) and above- and belowground biomass at the end of both experiments. I also measured total non-structural carbohydrates and nitrogen in these plants. Shade was the most important factor limiting the growth rates and biomass of eastern redcedars. I also found that there were significant declines in nitrogen and non-structural carbohydrates when shaded. These results are consistent with the notion that the eastern redcedar is a pioneer forest species, and that shade is the reason that these redcedars are replaced by other tree species. In the second experiment, I found that a single fire had a negative effect on young trees. There was no significant effect of competition with grass, perhaps because the competitive effect was shading by grasses and not nutrient depletion. Overall, the effects of shade were far more apparent than the effects of fire."

      "<i>Impatiens capensis</i> is an annual plant native to eastern North America that is currently spreading across Europe. In Poland, due to this plant's rapid spread in the secondary range and high competitiveness in relation to native species, it is considered a locally invasive species. The microstructure of seeds is an important tool for solving various taxonomic problems and also provides data useful for determining the impact of various environmental factors on the phenotypic variability of species. This issue is particularly important in regard to invasive species which occupy a wide range of habitats in the invaded range. There are few reports on seed size and thus far no descriptions of the seed ultrastructure of <i>I. capensis</i> in the analyzed literature. We present new data on the seed morphology of <i>I. capensis</i> growing in different habitats and conditions in the secondary range of the species. The studied populations differed significantly in each of the investigated traits (seed length, width, circumference, area, roundness, and mass). Our findings showed that anthropogenic disturbances in habitats and some soil parameters (presence of carbonates, potassium, loose sand, and moisture) were statistically significant with various seed sizes and morphology in the studied populations of <i>I. capensis</i>. Moreover, our studies showed maximum seed length (5.74 mm) and width (3.21 mm) exceeding those values given in the available literature. For the first time, we also provide a detailed SEM study of the ultrastructure of the seed coat of <i>I. capensis</i>. There are two types of epidermal cells on the seeds: (a) between the ribs (elongated with straight anticlinal walls, slightly concave outer periclinal walls, and micropapillate secondary sculpture on the edges with anticyclic walls), and (b) on the ribs (isodiametric cells with straight anticlinal walls and concave outer periclinal walls). Unlike the variability of size and weight of seeds, the coat ornamentation has turned out to be a steady feature within the studied secondary range of <i>I. capensis</i>."

      "Biological invasions can affect ecosystems across a wide spectrum of bioclimatic conditions. Therefore, it is often important to systematically monitor the spread of species over a broad region. Remote sensing has been an important tool for large-scale ecological studies in the past three decades, but it was not commonly used to study alien invasive plants until the mid 1990s. We synthesize previous research efforts on remote sensing of invasive plants from spatial, temporal and spectral perspectives. We also highlight a recently developed state-of-the-art image fusion technique that integrates passive and active energies concurrently collected by an imaging spectrometer and a scanning-waveform light detection and ranging (LiDAR) system, respectively. This approach provides a means to detect the structure and functional properties of invasive plants of different canopy levels. Finally, we summarize regional studies of biological invasions using remote sensing, discuss the limitations of remote sensing approaches, and highlight current research needs and future directions."

      "Projected climate changes are thought to promote emerging infectious diseases, though to date, evidence linking climate changes and such diseases in plants has not been available. Cassava is perhaps the most important crop in Africa for smallholder farmers. Since the late 1990's there have been reports from East and Central Africa of pandemics of begomoviruses in cassava linked to high abundances of whitefly species within the Bemisia tabaci complex. We used CLIMEX, a process-oriented climatic niche model, to explore if this pandemic was linked to recent historical climatic changes. The climatic niche model was corroborated with independent observed field abundance of B. tabaci in Uganda over a 13-year time-series, and with the probability of occurrence of B. tabaci over 2 years across the African study area. Throughout a 39-year climate time-series spanning the period during which the pandemics emerged, the modelled climatic conditions for B. tabaci improved significantly in the areas where the pandemics had been reported and were constant or decreased elsewhere. This is the first reported case where observed historical climate changes have been attributed to the increase in abundance of an insect pest, contributing to a crop disease pandemic."

      "<h4>Purpose of review</h4>The current review provides an update on the recent research developments regarding amino acid bioavailability in conditions of both good health and gut disorders.<h4>Recent findings</h4>Determination of amino acid bioavailability is complex and invasive. Minimally invasive methods using stable isotopes have been developed for humans. Data were collected in different models - humans, pigs and rats with various procedures - leading to interstudy variability. They mainly focused on either plant protein or the effect of food processing on animal protein. Plant protein in their original food matrix (legumes, grains, nuts) are generally less digestible (about 80%) than animal protein (meat, egg, milk; about 93%). Food processing has a limited impact on animal protein but its effect might be higher on plant protein. Few studies have documented the effect of gut disorders on protein digestibility, except in gastric bypass where paradoxical effects were reported. Data are needed to identify the amplitude of protein malabsorption in diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease or environmental enteric dysfunction.<h4>Summary</h4>The past 5 years have seen a renewed interest in amino acid bioavailability in view of assessing protein quality to support current shifts in protein sourcing. Methodological developments have been performed and several studies have reported values in various models. The question of protein digestibility in gut disorders remains poorly addressed."

      "Spotted lanternfly (SLF) is an invasive insect in the Northeastern U.S. projected to spread nationally and globally. While SLF is a significant pest of vineyards, little is known about the pest in grape agroecosystems including its spatial ecology. SLF spatial patterns were analyzed using a combination of approaches including generalized linear mixed effect models, Moran's I statistic for spatial clustering, and Empirical Bayesian Kriging. Analysis revealed that SLF displayed significantly clumped distributions in monitored vineyards. Approximately 54% and 44% of the respective adult and egg mass populations were observed within the first 15 m of the vineyard edge. Importantly, the spatial concentration of adults at the edge was consistent temporally, both between years and weeks. Moreover, high populations of SLF on vines were significantly correlated with reduced fruit production in the following year. Mark-release-recapture of SLF revealed that higher proportions of SLF were recaptured on vines with high pre-existing SLF populations, indicating that SLF may exhibit aggregation behavior along vineyard perimeters. Monitoring and management efforts for SLF should be prioritized around vineyard edges as it may significantly reduce infestations and subsequent damage."

      "Dioecy, the separation of reproductive organs on different individuals, has evolved repeatedly in different plant families. Several evolutionary paths to dioecy have been suggested, but the mechanisms behind sex determination is not well understood. The diploid dioecious Amaranthus palmeri represents a well suited model system to study sex determination in plants. Despite the agricultural importance of the species, the genetic control and evolutionary state of dioecy in A. palmeri is currently unknown. Early cytogenetic experiments did not identify heteromorphic chromosomes. Here, we used whole genome sequencing of male and female pools from two independent populations to elucidate the genetic control of dioecy in A. palmeri. Read alignment to a close monoecious relative and allele frequency comparisons between male and female pools did not reveal significant sex linked genes. Consequently, we employed an alignment free k-mer comparison which enabled us to identify a large number of male specific k-mers. We assembled male specific contigs comprising a total of almost 2 Mb sequence, proposing a XY sex determination system in the species. We were able to identify the potential Y chromosome in the A. palmeri draft genome sequence as 90 % of our male specific sequence aligned to a single scaffold. Based on our findings we suggest an intermediate evolutionary state of dioecy with a young Y chromosome in A. palmeri. Our findings give insight into the evolution of sex chromosomes in plants and may help to develop sustainable strategies for weed management."

      "<i>Buxus</i> sp. is an important native and ornamental tree in Europe threatened by a serious invasive pest <i>Cydalima perspectalis</i>. The larvae of this moth are able to defoliate box trees and cause their death. The development of novel biopesticides targeting this pest might help protect <i>Buxus</i> trees grown wildly or in city parks. Laboratory experiments were conducted to assess the efficacy of entomopathogenic fungus <i>Isaria fumosorosea</i> strain CCM 8367 against <i>C. perspectalis</i>. The last-instar larvae of the box tree moth were treated by the suspension of fungus conidia at concentrations ranging from 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> spores per 1 mL. Fungus infection was observed mostly in pupae, but the maximum mortality did not exceed 60%, indicating a very low susceptibility of <i>C. perspectalis</i> to <i>I. fumosorosea</i>. Furthermore, a number of ungerminated fungal conidia were found on larval cuticles using a low-temperature scanning electron microscopy. Our data also reveal that the hydroalcoholic extract from <i>B. sempervirens</i> leaves significantly inhibits both the germination of <i>I. fumosorosea</i> conidia and fungus growth. It can be speculated that the strain CCM 8367 of <i>I. fumosorosea</i> is not a potent biocontrol agent against <i>C. perspectalis</i> and low virulence of the fungus might be due to the accumulation of host plant phytochemicals having antimicrobial activity in larval cuticle of the pest."

      "In this review, a brief description of the invasive phenomena associated with plants and its consequences to the ecosystem is presented. Five worldwide invasive plants that are a threat to Portugal were selected as an example, and a brief description of each is presented. A full description of their secondary metabolites and biological activity is given, and a resume of the biological activity of extracts is also included. The chemical and pharmaceutical potential of invasive species sensu lato is thus acknowledged. With this paper, we hope to demonstrate that invasive species have potential positive attributes even though at the same time they might need to be controlled or eradicated. Positive attributes include chemical and pharmaceutical properties and developing these could help mitigate the costs of management and eradication."

      "Adaptation measures are necessary to ensure the stability and performance of the food supply relative to anthropogenic climate change. Although a wide range of measures have been proposed (e.g., planting dates, crop choices, drought resistance), there may be a ubiquitous means to increase productivity relatively quickly. Numerous studies have shown that the projected increase in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> can stimulate crop growth and seed yield with noted intra-specific differences within crop cultivars, suggesting potential differences to CO<sub>2</sub> that could be exploited to enhance seed yield in the future. However, it is worth emphasizing that atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> has already risen substantially (≈27% since 1970) and that, at present, no active effort by breeders has been made to select for the CO<sub>2</sub> increase that has already occurred. In contrast, for weedy or crop wild relatives (CWR), there are indications of evolutionary adaptation to these recent increases. While additional steps are needed, the identification and introgression of these CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive traits into modern crop cultivars may be a simple and direct means to increase crop growth and seed yield."

      "The presented study evaluated effects of potassium nitrate (KNO3), ammonium nitrate (NH4 NO3) and ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) on the germination-related characteristics of 10 species from European dry acidic grasslands. Germination was studied under controlled laboratory conditions. The seeds were subjected to KNO3, NH4 NO3 and NH4Cl in four doses (1, 10, 50 and 100 mM) and to distilled water. Final germination percentage, index of germination velocity and index of germination synchrony were determined. Content of nitrogen in the soil probed from the site of seeds collection was also analyzed. Significant effects of type of the nitrogen compounds and their concentrations were observed. High concentrations of nitrogen-containing salts inhibited completion of germination in almost all species. Helichrysum arenarium and Hypericum perforatum showed preference for NH4+ over NO3‒, whereas Arnoseris minima, Alyssum montanum, Jasione montana and Spergula morisonii showed preference for NO3‒ over NH4+. Centaurea scabiosa, C. stoebe and Hypochaeris radicata had no preference and wide tolerance to the type of nitrogen-containing compound. Echium vulgare showed differential response hard for interpretation. A. montanum and J. montana showed stenotopic behavior in terms of nitrogen-related conditions. It is proposed that nitrogen-rich soil gaps favor establishment of more nitro-tolerant plant species (e.g. C. scabiosa, C. stoebe and H. radicata) as compared to nitrogen-poor ones."

      "Mosquito-borne infectious diseases are a persistent problem in tropical regions of the world, including Southeast Asia. Vector control has relied principally on synthetic insecticides, but these have detrimental environmental effects and there is an increasing demand for plant-based agents to control insect pests. Invasive weedy plant species may be able to serve as readily available sources of essential oils, some of which may be useful as larvicidal agents for control of mosquito populations. We hypothesize that members of the genus <i>Conyza</i> (Asteraceae) may produce essential oils that may have mosquito larvicidal properties. The essential oils from the aerial parts of <i>Conyza bonariensis</i>, <i>C. canadensis</i>, and <i>C. sumatrensis</i> were obtained by hydrodistillation, analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and screened for mosquito larvicidal activity against <i>Aedes aegypti</i>, <i>Ae. albopictus</i> and <i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i>. The essential oils of <i>C. canadensis</i> and <i>C. sumatrensis</i>, both rich in limonene (41.5% and 25.5%, respectively), showed notable larvicidal activities against <i>Ae. aegypti</i> (24-h LC<sub>50</sub> = 9.80 and 21.7 μg/mL, respectively) and <i>Ae. albopictus</i> (24-h LC<sub>50</sub> = 18.0 and 19.1 μg/mL, respectively). These two <i>Conyza</i> species may, therefore, serve as sources for alternative, environmentally-benign larvicidal control agents."

      "<h4>Background</h4>The rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae is a destructive pathogen of rice and other related crops, causing significant yield losses worldwide. Endogenous small RNAs (sRNAs), including small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are critical components of gene regulation in many eukaryotic organisms. Recently several new species of sRNAs have been identified in fungi. This fact along with the availability of genome sequence makes M. oryzae a compelling target for sRNA profiling. We have examined sRNA species and their biosynthetic genes in M. oryzae, and the degree to which these elements regulate fungal stress responses. To this end, we have characterized sRNAs under different physiological stress conditions, which had not yet been examined in this fungus.<h4>Results</h4>The resulting libraries are composed of more than 37 million total genome matched reads mapping to intergenic regions, coding sequences, retrotransposons, inverted, tandem, and other repeated regions of the genome with more than half of the small RNAs arising from intergenic regions. The 24 nucleotide (nt) size class of sRNAs was predominant. A comparison to transcriptional data of M. oryzae undergoing the same physiological stresses indicates that sRNAs play a role in transcriptional regulation for a small subset of genes. Support for this idea comes from generation and characterization of mutants putatively involved in sRNAs biogenesis; our results indicate that the deletion of Dicer-like genes and an RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase gene increases the transcriptional regulation of this subset of genes, including one involved in virulence.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Various physiological stressors and in planta conditions alter the small RNA profile of the rice blast fungus. Characterization of sRNA biosynthetic mutants helps to clarify the role of sRNAs in transcriptional control."

      "Invasive plants are an ongoing subject of interest in North American forests, owing to their impacts on forest structure and regeneration, biodiversity, and ecosystem services. An important component of studying and managing forest invaders involves knowing where the species are, or could be, geographically located. Temporal and environmental context, in conjunction with spatially-explicit species occurrence information, can be used to address this need. Here, we predict the potential current and future distributions of four forest plant invaders in Minnesota: common buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica), glossy buckthorn (Frangula alnus), garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), and multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora). We assessed the impact of two different climate change scenarios (IPCC RCP 6.0 and 8.5) at two future timepoints (2050s and 2070s) as well as the importance of occurrence data sources on the potential distribution of each species. Our results suggest that climate change scenarios considered here could result in a potential loss of suitable habitat in Minnesota for both buckthorn species and a potential gain for R. multiflora and A. petiolata. Differences in predictions as a result of input occurrence data source were most pronounced in future climate projections."

      "This dataset presents data collected from household surveys from Upper Madi Watershed of Nepal describing the benefits of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) to people of mountain ecosystems, their perceptions of climate change, and perceived impacts of climate change on NTFPs ecosystem services. The data were collected from 278 households that were randomly selected from the four villages in the watershed during the period September to December 2019. The survey assessed socio-demographic information; collected and utilized NTFPs; perceptions of climate change, and; perceived impacts of climate change on NTFPs ecosystem services. These data are important in understanding the benefits of non-timber forest products in mountain ecosystems and the impacts of climate change as the benefits and impacts are currently not well understood. The data will be helpful in formulation and implementation of adaptation strategies to sustain the supply, protection, and management of NTFPs in mountain ecosystems."

      "It has been reported that the invasion of <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> changed the soil microbial community in the mangrove ecosystem in China, especially the bacterial community, although the response of soil fungal communities and soil microbial ecological functions to the invasion of <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> remains unclear. In this study, we selected three different communities (i.e., <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> community (SC), <i>Spartina alterniflora</i>-mangrove mixed community (TC), and mangrove community (MC)) in the Zhangjiangkou Mangrove Nature Reserve in China. High-throughput sequencing technology was used to analyze the impact of <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> invasion on mangrove soil microbial communities. Our results indicate that the invasion of <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> does not cause significant changes in microbial diversity, but it can alter the community structure of soil bacteria. The results of the LEfSe (LDA Effect Size) analysis show that the relative abundance of some bacterial taxa is not significantly different between the MC and SC communities, but different changes have occurred during the invasion process (i.e., TC community). Different from the results of the bacterial community, the invasion of <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> only cause a significant increase in few fungal taxa during the invasion process, and these taxa are at some lower levels (such as family, genus, and species) and classified into the phylum <i>Ascomycota</i>. Although the invasion of <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> changes the taxa with certain ecological functions, it may not change the potential ecological functions of soil microorganisms (i.e., the potential metabolic pathways of bacteria, nutritional patterns, and fungal associations). In general, the invasion of <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> changes the community structure of soil microorganisms, but it may not affect the potential ecological functions of soil microorganisms."

      "Invasive species are a major threat to biodiversity, human health, and economies worldwide. Clonal growth is a common ability of most invasive plants. The clonal common milkweed Asclepias syriaca L. is the most widespread invasive species in Pannonic sand grasslands. Despite of being an invader in disturbed semi-natural vegetation, this plant prefers agricultural fields or plantations. Herbicide treatment could be one of the most cost-effective and efficient methods for controlling the extended stands of milkweed in both agricultural and protected areas. The invasion of milkweed stand was monitored from 2011 to 2017 in a strictly protected UNESCO biosphere reserve in Hungary, and a single herbicide treatment was applied in May 2014. This single treatment was successful only in a short-term but not in a long-term period, as the number of milkweed shoots decreased following herbicide treatment. The herbicide translocation by rhizomatic roots induced the damage of dormant bud banks. The surviving buds developing shoots, growth of the milkweed stand showed a slow regeneration for a longer-term period. We concluded that the successful control of milkweed after herbicide treatment depends on repeated management of treated areas to suppress further spreading during subsequent seasons."

      "The slug, <i>Arion vulgaris</i> Moquin-Tandon, 1855, is a serious pest in agriculture and private gardens. White worm, <i>Enchytraeus albidus</i> Henle, 1837, is an important model of decomposer organism in the terrestrial ecosystem. Saponins, which are secondary metabolites of plants, have previously been shown to have some molluscicidal effect. We investigated which doses of saponins are lethal to the slug, <i>A. vulgaris</i>, and to the non-target organism, <i>E. albidus</i>. An aqueous solution with different concentrations of saponin extract from the bark of the soap tree, <i>Quillaja saponaria</i> Mol., was used in repeat treatments. Slugs were tested in filter paper contact tests as they are naturally exposed to soil contact while crawling. Worms were tested in soil contact tests as they live below ground. It was found that lethality of saponins depends on the slug age group and the environmental temperature. The median lethal concentration (LC<sub>50</sub>, at 15 °C) on adults was 68.5 g/L, and on juveniles, 96.9 g/L. The slugs were significantly more sensitive at 2 and -1 °C compared to 15 °C. The LC<sub>50</sub> (at 6 ℃) on <i>E. albidus</i> was 2.7 g/L (or 0.5 g/kg dry weight of soil), far below those in <i>A. vulgaris</i> (at 15 ℃ and lower). The LC<sub>50</sub> for worms at -1℃ was also significantly lower than at 6 ℃. Therefore, we can conclude: (1) that <i>Q. saponaria</i> saponins may be a successful slug control tool used during colder times of the year, but its concentration should be selected according to the age group of <i>A. vulgaris</i>; (2) this measure is more toxic than expected to white worms, which limits its use."
