<p>The niches of California and central Chile were significantly more similar than chance (D = 0.428; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105025-g001">Figure 1</xref>), from California to central Chile (P = 0.001) and from central Chile to California (P = 0.04). More specifically, the niche in central Chile was almost completely included (nested) within the Californian niche (S = 0.993) (
