<p>The projected distribution models performed well (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105025-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) and the projection from California covers 139,526 km
 <sup>2</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105025-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Comparisons between these projected distributions revealed that almost the complete projected distribution from central Chile was included in the projected distribution from California (99.9%). A large portion of the projected distributions (65%) was also predicted only from California model. This area extended approximately 2° further north and approximately 1° further to the south (
