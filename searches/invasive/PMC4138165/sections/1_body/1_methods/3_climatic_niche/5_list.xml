  <p>Stability niche area (S); the area shared between niches of the native and the invaded range. This area is an estimation of niche conservatism (S is the proportion of the densities in the invaded niche that overlap the native niche)

  <p>The unfilling niche area (U); this is the niche space of the native range that isn't shared with the niche of the species in the invaded range and this area indicates the potential space of the invaded niche that has not yet been occupied in the native range. In other words, U is an estimation of how far the species is from geographical equilibrium (U is the proportion of densities in the native niche found in different conditions to the invaded niche)

  <p>The expanded niche zone (E); the niche zone in the invaded range which is not shared with the native niche. This area is the degree of niche shift; it indicates new climatic environments occupied by the species in the invaded range (E is the proportion of densities in the invaded niche found in different conditions to the native niche)
