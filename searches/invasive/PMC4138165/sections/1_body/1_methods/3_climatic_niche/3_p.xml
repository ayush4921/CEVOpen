<p>Occurrence points were converted into density values using a kernel function to smooth the distribution of the densities 
 <xref rid="pone.0105025-Broennimann2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. These figures were then gridded within the environmental envelope obtained by the previously chosen background zones (10,000 randomly generated points) in the native and invaded range. The occurrence points, converted in occurrence density were ordered along the PCA axes constructed from the climatic environment within the background zones. Two graphical models were constructed for niche analysis: the first, describing the ecological niche of the species in its native range, and the second, describing the ecological niche of the species in the invaded range.
