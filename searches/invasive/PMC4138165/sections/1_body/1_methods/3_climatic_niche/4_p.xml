<p>A comparison between the native and the invaded range was used to assess whether 
 <italic>E. californica's</italic> niche has been conserved in central Chile. For this comparison, niche similarity was measured using Schoener's D overlap index 
 <xref rid="pone.0105025-Warren1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, the result falling between 0 (no overlap) and 1 (complete overlap). The D overlap index was tested against chance using re-sampling procedures
