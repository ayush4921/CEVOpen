<p>Both SDMs were replicated 100 times, and then averaged. Finally, to predict altitudinal distribution of 
 <italic>E. californica</italic> in central Chile, we generated prediction for niche occupancy profiles

 <xref rid="pone.0105025-Evans1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>; in this study we used altitudinal gradient.
