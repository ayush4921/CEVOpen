<p>For SDMs regularization, we smoothed the models to avoid over-parameterization

 <xref rid="pone.0105025-Elith2" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. The regularization refers to smoothing the model, making it more regular, so as to avoid fitting too complex a model 
 <xref rid="pone.0105025-Elith2" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. In Maxent, the fit of the model is measured at the occurrence sites, using a “log likelihood” (see Box 1 in 
 <xref rid="pone.0105025-Elith2" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>). A highly complex model will have a high log likelihood, but may not generalize well

 <xref rid="pone.0105025-Elith2" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. The smoothing was achieved by modifying a β parameter i.e. the value that smoothens the model, making it more regular. β = 1 was the best choice as it led to the most conservative model
