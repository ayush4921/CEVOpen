<p>From each occurrence point in central Chile, we extracted a prediction for occurrence probability from the distribution models. Probability values below the 10% percentile

To compare distribution models, we projected potential distribution from the native range (California) to central Chile, and compared it with the projected potential distribution for central Chile
