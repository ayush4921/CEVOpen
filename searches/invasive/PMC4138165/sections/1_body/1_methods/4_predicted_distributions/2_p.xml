<p>We divided the presence data into two parts: 75% for training and 25% for testing the model. The model's performance was evaluated using the AUC (area under the ROC curve 
 <xref rid="pone.0105025-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>). AUC is a composite measure for model performance and provides a global comparison of model fitting relative to a random prediction. AUC ranges from 0.5 for a model that performs no better than chance to 1.0 for perfect ability to predict presence
