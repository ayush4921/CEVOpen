 <italic>E. californica</italic> in its native range and. If pollinated, the resulting fruit is a long, slender pod that dries and splits, shooting tiny round black seeds in all directions. This species persists in the seed bank during dry season, lying dormant as seed for years in some areas. When enough rain falls seeds rapidly germinate and become reproductive in a matter of a few months
