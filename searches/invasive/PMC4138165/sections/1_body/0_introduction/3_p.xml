<p>However, this protocol is controversial because it excludes the possibility to detect niche shifts to non-analogous environments that could be occupied by invasive species in the invaded range. For example, invasive species could occupy new environments (nonanalogous) due to adaptive evolution during invasions, the absence of biotic constraints, the absence of dispersal limitations

 <xref rid="pone.0105025-Petitpierre1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. There is evidence of niche conservatism in invasive plants 
 <xref rid="pone.0105025-Petitpierre1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>; however there are cases where invasive plants display climatic niche shifts, thus occupying areas within climates that were not expected, based on native climatic requirements
