<p>California and central Chile are two distant geographic areas with very similar Mediterranean climates, topography and vegetation types

 <xref rid="pone.0105025-Sax2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. These features have stimulated comparative studies which have demonstrated that, despite their similarities, each geographic area has distinctive native and exotic flora

 <xref rid="pone.0105025-Jimnez1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Overall, these quite distinctive floras have undergone convergent evolution, expressed in similar native vegetation structure and the functional traits of native plants
