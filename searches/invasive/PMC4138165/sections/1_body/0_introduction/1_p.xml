<p>Understanding the factors that lead to the successful spread of species outside their native ranges is a fundamental issue in the study of biological invasions

 <xref rid="pone.0105025-Sexton1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The geographic distribution of invasive species is controlled by factors such as climatic requirements, dispersal ability and biotic interactions 
 <xref rid="pone.0105025-Alexander1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Among these factors, species climate requirements are important and can be useful for predicting the geographic spread of species at large spatial scales
