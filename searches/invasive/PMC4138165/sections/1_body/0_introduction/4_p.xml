<p>One assumption commonly used in biogeographical studies is that species are capable of covering the entirety of a given geographic extent that best suits their climatic requirements, rapidly reaching the geographic equilibrium

 <xref rid="pone.0105025-Vclavk1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> due to of several ecological aspects preventing their establishment and colonization, such as dispersal limitation
