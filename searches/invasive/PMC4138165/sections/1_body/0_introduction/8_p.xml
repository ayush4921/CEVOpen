<p>In this study, we addressed two questions: (i) has 
 <italic>E. californica</italic> conserved its climatic niche in Chile? and (ii) has 
 <italic>E. californica</italic> reached a geographical equilibrium or can we expect it to spread further in Chile? To answer these questions, we carried out climatic niche analyses based on principal component analysis (PCA) 
 <xref rid="pone.0105025-Broennimann2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> to identify parts of the climatic niche spaces that are stable in the invaded range (conserved), and either unfilled or expanded (non-equilibrium cases). We also constructed species distribution models (SDMs) to examine whether this species has achieved geographical equilibrium in central Chile. This information could also be used to plan management practices in order to prevent invasive species from spreading or to contain them.
