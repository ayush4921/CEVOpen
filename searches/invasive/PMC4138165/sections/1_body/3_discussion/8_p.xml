<p>From our study, in spite of the climatic niche 
 <italic>E. californica</italic> has been conserved, this species is not in geographical equilibrium and has the potential to continue spreading along Chile, especially into warm regions and to higher altitudes. Reaching geographical equilibrium will depend on its dispersal abilities and to what extent native communities will resist invasion.
