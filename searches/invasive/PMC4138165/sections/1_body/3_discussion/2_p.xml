<p>Climatic niche conservatism has been largely detected in invasive plant species 
 <xref rid="pone.0105025-Petitpierre1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. If the niches are conserved, then the potential distribution predicted from the native range should be concordant with predictions based on occurrences in the invaded range 
 <xref rid="pone.0105025-Peterson2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. However, we can find mismatches between native and invaded range projections due to other ecological factors, even if the climatic niche is conserved (dispersal limitation, biotic interactions)
