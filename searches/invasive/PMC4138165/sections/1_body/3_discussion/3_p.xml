<p>In 
 <italic>E. californica</italic>, the projected potential distribution from the native niche differs from the projected distribution from the invaded range. In fact, this area was 2.9 times larger than that projected from the invaded range and extended further north and south (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105025-g002">Figure 2</xref>). These large differences were not concordant with the slight niche differences between native and invaded range obtained from PCA analysis. In fact, the niche differences were proportionally minors than potential distributions differences between the two ranges. The niche - biotope duality (the conceptual base of the SDMs) 
 <xref rid="pone.0105025-Colwell1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> explain this asymmetric relationship. The duality means that the niche and the geographic space are closely interconnected 
 <xref rid="pone.0105025-Hutchinson1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. However this duality is not one-to-one 
 <xref rid="pone.0105025-Colwell1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0105025-Hutchinson1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> i.e. one small and regular zone in the niche space may correspond to many areas in the geographic space 
 <xref rid="pone.0105025-Sobern1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. This asymmetric property of the niche- biotope duality has been largely reviewed and discussed in the literature
