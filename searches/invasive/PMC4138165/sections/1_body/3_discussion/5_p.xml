<p>We have estimated that populations of 
 <italic>E. californica</italic> in central Chile, have a positive finite growth rate homogeneously distributed along latitudinal as well as altitudinal gradients 
 <xref rid="pone.0105025-PeaGmez1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, suggesting that it performs well across a variety of environments, thus reinforcing the idea that it is a generalist species. If it has no demographic limitations, it could spread covering large geographical ranges as predicted by the native niche model. However, this species could be also dispersal limited based on genetic evidence that indicates that gene flow between populations is limited (Castillo, Master thesis, unpublished data).
