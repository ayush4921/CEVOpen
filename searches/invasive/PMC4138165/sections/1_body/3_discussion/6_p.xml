<p>High-elevation ecosystems are considered more resistant to plant invasions than other ecosystems 
 <xref rid="pone.0105025-Alexander2" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>; as elevation increases, the environment changes dramatically: mean temperatures decrease, the growing season shortens and UV-B radiation becomes more intense

 <italic>E. californica</italic>, from the native and invaded ranges lead us to agree with this assertion. In fact, the mean altitude predicted from California was more than double the central Chile model's, further supporting the non-equilibrium condition of 
 <italic>E. californica</italic> to higher altitudes.
