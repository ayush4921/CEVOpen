<p>Our results indicate that the climatic niches of 
 <italic>E. californica</italic> in California and central Chile were very similar to each other. This similarity had two particular characteristics: the climatic niche in central Chile was almost completely included within the niche of the native range, and a minor fraction of niche in the invaded range expanded to new environments. However, the larger fraction of unfilled niche predicted from the native niche suggests that 
 <italic>E. californica</italic> hasn't colonized a substantial fraction of the climatic environments in central Chile. An alternative explanation is that the species has colonized only the environments in Chile that overlap between the Californian and Chilean background climates due to the arrival of a biased set of colonizers, with a narrower climatic niche.
