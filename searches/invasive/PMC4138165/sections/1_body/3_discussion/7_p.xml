<p>One explanation is that 
 <italic>E. californica</italic> is dispersal limited along elevational gradients (low propagule pressure

 <xref rid="pone.0105025-Alexander3" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>). Another explanation is that before an alien plant species can reach mountain areas, it presumably passes through a “low altitude filter” that excludes those genotypes well-adapted to higher altitudes 
 <xref rid="pone.0105025-Becker1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. In this way, the flow of pre-adapted genes, which evolved at higher altitudes in the native range, is disrupted, and then no expansion would be expected until such adaptations emerge, as it has happened in other species along elevation gradients
