 <caption> Species distribution models (SDMs) for Eschscholzia californica in central Chile. A) Generated with occurrences recorded in the invaded range (central Chile). B) Generated with occurrences recorded in the native range (California). C) Overlap of both SDMs. It shows that 99.9% of the invaded range predicted from central Chile (blue) is included in the area predicted from California; 65% of the area predicted from California (green) is not predicted by the SDM from central Chile; only a small proportion of area (0.1%) in Chile (red) is not predicted from California. AUC values for these models are displayed in Table 1. </caption>
