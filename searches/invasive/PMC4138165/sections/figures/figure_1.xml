  <title>Principal Component Analysis (PCA).</title>
  <p>The climatic niche of 
   <italic>Eschscholzia californica</italic> in the native range in California (green) and in the invaded range in central Chile (red). The blue area corresponds to niche areas shared in both ranges (niche stability).The solid and dashed lines show 100% and 75% of the climatic envelope from the native (green) and from the invaded range (red), respectively. The green area is the unfilled climatic niche space in the invaded range, and the red area, is the expanded climatic niche in the invaded range. The more intense blue cells represent zones with higher occurrence densities in the invaded niche (central Chile). In the PCA analysis the first axis accounts for 47.66% of the total variance and mainly represents mean annual precipitation, precipitation during the warmest quarter and altitude; the second PCA axis accounts for 29.68% of the total variance and mainly represents precipitation seasonality. In the correlation circle, the hidden label (behind bio7) corresponds to temperature seasonality (bio4).
