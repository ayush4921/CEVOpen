  <title>Species distribution models (SDMs) for 
   <italic>Eschscholzia californica</italic> in central Chile.
  </title>
  <p>A) Generated with occurrences recorded in the invaded range (central Chile). B) Generated with occurrences recorded in the native range (California). C) Overlap of both SDMs. It shows that 99.9% of the invaded range predicted from central Chile (blue) is included in the area predicted from California; 65% of the area predicted from California (green) is not predicted by the SDM from central Chile; only a small proportion of area (0.1%) in Chile (red) is not predicted from California. AUC values for these models are displayed in
