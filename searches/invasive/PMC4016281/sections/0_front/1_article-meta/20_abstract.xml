 <p>Secondary metabolites released by invasive plants can increase their competitive ability by affecting native plants, herbivores, and pathogens at the invaded land. Whether these secondary metabolites affect the invasive plant itself, directly or indirectly through microorganisms, however, has not been well documented. Here we tested whether activated carbon (AC), a well-known absorbent for secondary metabolites, affect arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbioses and competitive ability in an invasive plant. We conducted three experiments (experiments 1â€“3) with the invasive forb 
  <italic>Solidago canadensis</italic> and the native 
  <italic>Kummerowia striata.</italic> Experiment 1 determined whether AC altered soil properties, levels of the main secondary metabolites in the soil, plant growth, and AMF communities associated with 
  <italic>S. canadensis</italic> and 
  <italic>K. striata</italic>. Experiment 2 determined whether AC affected colonization of 
  <italic>S. canadensis</italic> by five AMF, which were added to sterilized soil. Experiment 3 determined the competitive ability of 
  <italic>S. canadensis</italic> in the presence and absence of AMF and AC. In experiment 1, AC greatly decreased the concentrations of the main secondary metabolites in soil, and the changes in concentrations were closely related with the changes of AMF in 
  <italic>S. canadensis</italic> roots. In experiment 2, AC inhibited the AMF 
  <italic>Glomus versiforme</italic> and 
  <italic>G. geosporum</italic> but promoted 
  <italic>G. mosseae</italic> and 
  <italic>G. diaphanum</italic> in the soil and also in 
  <italic>S. canadensis</italic> roots. In experiment 3, AC reduced 
  <italic>S. canadensis</italic> competitive ability in the presence but not in the absence of AMF. Our results provided indirect evidence that the secondary metabolites (which can be absorbed by AC) of the invasive plant 
  <italic>S. canadensis</italic> may promote 
  <italic>S. canadensis</italic> competitiveness by enhancing its own AMF symbionts.
