  <title>Effects of AMF and AC treatments on the competition of 
   <italic>S. canadensis</italic> (experiment 3).
  </title>
  <p>Competitive ability (as indicated by the aggressivity index) of 
   <italic>S. canadensis</italic> as affected by AMF (AMF or No AMF) and activated carbon (AC or No AC) (experiment 3). A lower value for the index indicates greater competitive ability. Values are means Â± SE. Means for No AC with different uppercase letters and means for AC with different lowercase letters are significantly different at 
   <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05. For comparison of paired bars (No AC vs. AC), asterisks indicate significant differences (*&lt;0.05), and ns indicates not significant.
