 <caption> Effects of activated carbon (AC) on shoot biomass and AMF community of plants (experiment 1). Effects of AC on shoot biomass of S. canadensis and K. striata (A), AMF colonization rate (B) and on the phylotypes of AMF communities in the roots of S. canadensis and K. striata (C) growing in field soil in experiment 1. GA1–GA6 are phylotypes ( Fig. S2). Values are means ± SE. P-value: *&lt;0.05; **&lt;0.01; ns, not significant. Means with different letters are significantly different. </caption>
