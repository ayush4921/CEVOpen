 <caption> Factors affecting the changes of AMF communities of host plants (experiment 1). CCA-biplot depicting the relationship between AMF communities and soil properties. Circles represent S. canadensis, and triangles represent K. striata; open symbols indicate No AC treatment while filled symbols indicate AC treatment. TN refers to total nitrogen; TP refers to total phosphorous; SOM refers to soil organic matter; AP refers to available P; Tph refers to total phenolics; Tfl refers to total flavones; Tsa refers to total saponins. The length of the arrows indicates the relative influence of the factor on community structure, while the angle between the arrows indicates the degree to which factors are correlated. </caption>
