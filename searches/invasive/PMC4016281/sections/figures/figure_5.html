 <caption> Effects of AMF and AC on growth and AMF colonization of S. canadensis (experiment 3). Shoot biomass (A) and AMF colonization (B) of S. canadensis under monoculture or mixture (with K. striata) as affected by AMF treatments (AMF or No AMF) and activated carbon treatments (AC or No AC) in experiment 3. Values are means Â± SE. Means for No AC with different uppercase letters and means for AC with different lowercase letters are significantly different at P&lt;0.05. For comparison of paired bars (No AC vs. AC), asterisks indicate significant differences (*&lt;0.05; **&lt;0.01), and ns indicates not significant. </caption>
