 <caption> Effects of AMF and AC treatments on the competition of S. canadensis (experiment 3). Competitive ability (as indicated by the aggressivity index) of S. canadensis as affected by AMF (AMF or No AMF) and activated carbon (AC or No AC) (experiment 3). A lower value for the index indicates greater competitive ability. Values are means Â± SE. Means for No AC with different uppercase letters and means for AC with different lowercase letters are significantly different at P&lt;0.05. For comparison of paired bars (No AC vs. AC), asterisks indicate significant differences (*&lt;0.05), and ns indicates not significant. </caption>
