<p>Interestingly, not all AMF species were affected in the same way by the secondary metabolites from 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic>. In experiment 2, for example, without the addition of AC, 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> secondary compounds greatly enhanced the growth (as indicated by spore density and root colonization) of 
 <italic>G. geosporum</italic> and 
 <italic>G. versiforme</italic> but did not affect the growth of 
 <italic>G. etunicatum</italic>. The DGGE data and the phylogenetic tree also indicated some AMF phylotypes were present in 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> roots only when secondary metabolites had been absorbed by AC. These differential effects on AMF growth confirm that different AMF species can respond differently to the same chemicals. For example, spore germination of 
 <italic>Glomus intraradices</italic> and 
 <italic>G. claroideum</italic> can respond differently to strigolactones 
 <xref rid="pone.0097163-Besserer1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. These results suggested that the development of symbioses between specific AMF and 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> was mediated by 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> secondary metabolites; this selective effect resulted in changes in the AMF community in the roots and also in the soil. In experiment 2, the beneficial AMF species 
 <italic>G. geosporum</italic> and 
 <italic>G. versiforme</italic> were able to promote greater growth of 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> than the AMF species that were considered to be less beneficial (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097163-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). These observations implied that 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic>â€™ secondary metabolites (which can be absorbed by AC in the soil) may specifically favor certain compatible AMF partners.
