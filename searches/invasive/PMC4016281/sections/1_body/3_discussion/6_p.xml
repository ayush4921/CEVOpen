<p>Secondary metabolites released by an invasive plant may enhance invasiveness by both direct and indirect effects. The direct effect involves the inhibition of native competitors through secondary metabolites without mediation by microorganisms. The indirect effect involves microorganisms that inhibit the native competitors or enhancing the invader

Although both field and common garden experiments have demonstrated that plant secondary metabolites can promote an invaderâ€™s competitive ability, past research was unable to separate the direct effects from indirect, microbially mediated effects of invasive non-indigenous plants

It follows that the reported impact of secondary metabolites on competition may in many or all cases have resulted from combined direct and indirect effects. In this study, we separated the direct and indirect effects of secondary metabolites on plant-plant competition using the intrinsic properties of activated carbon. Although our study was performed in microcosms and not in the field, it provided authentic evidence that plant secondary metabolites are able to enhance the competitive ability of an invader by increasing AMF colonization of the invader itself.
