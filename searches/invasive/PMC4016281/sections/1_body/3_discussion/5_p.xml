<p>Results from experiment 3 showed that the competitive ability of invasive 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> was influenced by both AC and AMF, i.e., release of chemicals by 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> enhanced AMF colonization of 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> roots. When AMF were absent, secondary metabolites did not increase the competitive ability of 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> and autotoxicity might have been generated instead (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097163-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). As a consequence, 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> grew better with AC treatment than without AC treatment in the absence of AMF. Autotoxicity is also exhibited by other exotic plants, including 
 <italic>Centaurea maculosa</italic>
 <xref rid="pone.0097163-Perry1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, and this phenomenon is a way to reduce intraspecific competition. When AMF inoculum was added to the soil, however, the autotoxic effect was not evident (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097163-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>), and secondary metabolites enhanced the competitive ability of 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097163-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). These results suggested that AMF can offset the negative effects of secondary metabolites on 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic>. In other words, secondary metabolites indirectly promoted the competitive ability of 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> via AMF. Given that secondary metabolites affected the degree of AMF colonization and the composition of the AMF community in the roots of the invasive 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> but had little effect on AMF in the roots of the native 
 <italic>K. striata</italic> in experiments 1 and 3, we concluded that the enhanced competitive ability of 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> might have been the consequence of its own secondary metabolites affecting its own AM symbioses.
