<p>It remains unclear how plant secondary metabolites affect the process of AMF symbiosis

 <xref rid="pone.0097163-Buee1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. One plausible avenue could be that some compounds (e.g., flavones, sesquiterpenes, and strigolactones) could act as signals that induce AMF spore germination

 <xref rid="pone.0097163-Scervino1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Flavones, phenolics, and saponins are commonly produced by many plants

 <xref rid="pone.0097163-Piotrowski1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, while flavones like chrysin and luteolin can promote AM symbiosis 
 <xref rid="pone.0097163-Scervino1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In this study, AC greatly reduced the levels of three types of secondary metabolites, indicating that the effects of AC on AMF symbiosis in 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> may be due to the decrease in the concentrations of secondary metabolites.
