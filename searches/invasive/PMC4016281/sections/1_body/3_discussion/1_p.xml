 <xref rid="pone.0097163-InderjitCallaway1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. AC, however, may also affect nutrient availability

 <xref rid="pone.0097163-Matsubara1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Thus, when AC is used in research concerning plant secondary compounds, its putative effects should be checked carefully. In our experiment 1, addition of AC did not change the general soil properties (soil organic matter, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, available phosphorus and pH) but greatly reduced the concentrations of total flavones, phenolics, and saponins. CCA also indicated that variation in the AMF community in 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> roots was more closely related to these secondary metabolites than to other soil properties and that these secondary metabolites enhanced the colonization of 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> roots by certain AMF species (experiment 2). We therefore deduced that the effects of AC in our study resulted predominantly from the absorption of secondary metabolites by AC.
