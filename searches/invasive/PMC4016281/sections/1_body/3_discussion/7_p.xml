<p>In conclusion, the effects of secondary metabolites produced by invasive plants on local plants have been well documented 
 <xref rid="pone.0097163-Callaway1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, but few studies had focused on how secondary chemicals released by an invasive plant affect that invasive plant itself. Our study demonstrated an interesting phenomenon of “self-promotion” by a plant invader resulting from the positive effects of its own secondary metabolites on the AMF that colonize its roots. The results presented here further expanded our understanding of the interesting role of secondary metabolites during plant invasion.
