<p>In a previous study with six 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> populations (three invasive populations from China and three native populations from America) and one 
 <italic>K. striata</italic> population (from the area invaded by 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> in China), we determined that the enhanced competitive ability of 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> relative to 
 <italic>K. striata</italic> in China resulted from increased root exudates 
 <xref rid="pone.0097163-Yuan1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Because neither biomass nor height of 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> in our previous study was significantly affected by the source of the 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> population (either from the original or invaded lands), the current study used one invasive 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> population originating from the invaded area in China. One native 
 <italic>K. striata</italic> population from China was also used. Seeds of 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> and 
 <italic>K. striata</italic> were collected in the same locations (30°16′N, 120°11′E) in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province (China), where the area was invaded by 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic>. Seeds of 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> and 
 <italic>K. striata</italic> were air-dried and stored at 4°C.
