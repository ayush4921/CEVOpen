<p>Microcosms were randomly arranged in each block in a greenhouse with natural light and with average daily temperatures ranging from 18–30°C during the experiment, which began in April and ended in October. Each microcosm was watered daily to maintain soil moisture at 70–90% of water-holding capacity. No additional nutrients were added during the experiment.</p>
