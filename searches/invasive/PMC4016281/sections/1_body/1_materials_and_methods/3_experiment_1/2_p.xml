<p>The experiment was a two factorial design, with two AC treatments (with and without AC), two host plants (invasive 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> and native 
 <italic>K. striata</italic>), and five replicates (five blocks). Each microcosm measured 20×15×20 cm (length×width×height) and contained 6 kg of soil. The soil used in the experiment was collected from Cixi City, Zhejiang Province, China (30°18′N, 121°10′E), where 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> had invaded the locality.
