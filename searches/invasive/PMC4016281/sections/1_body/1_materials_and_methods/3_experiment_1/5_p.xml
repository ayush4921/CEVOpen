<p>Experiment 1 was terminated 6 months after transplanting, which coincided with floral initiation. Root systems were separated from shoots. Half of each root sample was frozen at −80°C for molecular analysis. The remaining half of each root sample was used for quantification of AMF colonization. AMF colonization of roots was quantified using a microscope (×20 magnification) and utilizing the gridline intersection method
