<p>Soil samples in each microscope were air-dried and sieved for the test of soil properties. Soil properties were measured with the methods described in the preliminary experiment. Soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), available phosphorus (AP) and pH were tested. Three main secondary metabolites (total flavones, total phenolics, and total saponins) in the soil were also quantified using the methods described by Zhang et al. 
 <xref rid="pone.0097163-Zhang3" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. First, the crude soil extracts were obtained by placing the 10-g sample in 100 ml of 70% ethanol and later, filtering the sample through a Whatman no. 44 filter paper. Following which, total flavones in the crude extracts were determined by employing the NaNO
 <sub>2</sub>–Al(NO
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>3</sub>–NaOH colorimetric assay with rutin as the reference substance. Total phenolic acids were measured by the Folin-Ciocalteu assay with gallic acid as the reference substance. The total saponins were detected using vanillin–HClO
 <sub>4</sub> as the chromogenic reagent.
