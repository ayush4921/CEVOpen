<p>To examine the effects of AC on AMF in roots of 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> and 
 <italic>K. striata</italic>, we used a nested PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)-cloning-sequencing method. Each plant species was represented by three replicates. The details of the methods are described in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0097163.s003">Methods S1</xref>. The DGGE banding pattern obtained using this method was analyzed with Quantity-One software (Bio-Rad).
