<p>Each DNA sequence obtained from the AMF was subjected to similarity comparison using an online program (BLAST,

Sequences were subsequently registered in the GenBank database under accession numbers KC507871â€“KC507891. For the phylogenetic analysis, sequences with gaps were treated as missing data, and then a neighbor-joining tree (1,000 replicates) including the obtained sequences and their closest relatives from GenBank was constructed using MEGA version 4.0 with the Kimura 2-Parameter model. Sequences that were 2% different from each other were subsequently assigned to separate phylotypes. It is noteworthy that the tree topology and bootstrap value were always included in the analysis.
