<p>To analyze the potential influence of secondary metabolites and soil properties on the AMF community composition, we performed a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) with Monte-Carlo permutation tests (n = 499) using the Canoco for Windows version 4.52. In the CCA plot, the length of the arrows illustrated the relative importance of factors affecting community structure, while the angle between the arrows indicated the degree to which factors are correlated.</p>
