<p>The experiment was a three factorial design, with two AC treatments (No AC and AC), two AMF treatments (AMF and No AMF), and three plants culture types (monoculture of invasive, monoculture of native, and a mixture of invasive and native), and five replicates (five blocks). A total of 2×2×3×5 = 60 microcosms were produced. The microcosms and soil were the same as in experiment 1. Each microcosm was filled with 6 kg of soil that had been sterilized by γ-radiation and subsequently inoculated or not inoculated with AMF. Control microcosms without AMF received equal amounts of AMF inoculum sterilized by γ-radiation plus filtrate from the AMF inoculum that contained no AMF propagules; this was done to provide experimental control to account for potential mineral and non-mycorrhizal microbial components in the inoculum. AC was added to half the microcosms as indicated in experiment 1.</p>
