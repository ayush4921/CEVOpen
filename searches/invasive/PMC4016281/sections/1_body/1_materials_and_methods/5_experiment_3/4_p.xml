<p>The plants were harvested after 6 months, just before they began to flower. Roots were separated from shoots. Shoot samples were oven-dried (65°C for 48 h) for measurement of dry shoot biomass. AMF colonization of roots was quantified as described earlier for experiment 1. The competitive ability of 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> was determined using an aggressivity index (AI), which was based on shoot biomass data. The AI was calculated as described previously 
 <xref rid="pone.0097163-Yuan1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0097163-Scheublin1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. AI = (Y
 <sub>ij</sub>/Y
 <sub>ii</sub>)−(Y
 <sub>ji</sub>/Y
 <sub>jj</sub>), where Y
 <sub>ij</sub> and Y
 <sub>ii</sub> are the shoot biomasses of 
 <italic>K. striata</italic> growing in mixture and monoculture, and Y
 <sub>ji</sub> and Y
 <sub>jj</sub> are the shoot biomasses of 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> growing in mixture and monoculture. The competitive ability of 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> relative to 
 <italic>K. striata</italic> is inversely related to the AI value.
