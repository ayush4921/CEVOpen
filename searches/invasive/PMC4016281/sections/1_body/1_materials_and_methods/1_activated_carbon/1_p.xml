<p>Activated Carbon (AC) is often used as an experimental tool to absorb secondary metabolites in soil

 <xref rid="pone.0097163-InderjitCallaway1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Researchers have noted, however, that even in the absence of secondary metabolites, AC can affect plant growth by altering nutrient availability and other soil properties

 <xref rid="pone.0097163-Gundale1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. In a preliminary experiment, we tested whether AC affected soil properties with and without plants. There were five replicates for each treatment. The experiment lasted for six months. Soil samples were air-dried and sieved carefully, prior to testing. The concentration of soil organic matter (SOM) was measured by the K

Total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) in soil samples (1.0 g per sampling treatment) was determined with a San++ Continuous Flow Analyzer (Skalar, Netherlands). The pH of the soil from each sampling plot was measured using a soil–water slurry (1∶5 soil:water). Soil available phosphorus (AP) was analyzed by the Olsen method

 <sup>−1</sup> did not affect soil properties (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097163-t001">Table 1</xref>), and we therefore used AC at 20 ml l
 <sup>−1</sup> in this study. The P and N concentration in the AC was 0 and 0.18%, respectively, and the pH was 6.0. The effect of AC on soil properties was also evaluated in experiment 1 of the current study, as described later.
