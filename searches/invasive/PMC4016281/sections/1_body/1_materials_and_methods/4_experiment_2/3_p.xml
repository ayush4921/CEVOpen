<p>Seeds of 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> were germinated and pre-cultured as described in experiment 1. Two seedlings were transplanted into each microcosm. The microcosms were randomly arranged in each block in the greenhouse. All growth conditions were the same as in experiment 1. Six months after transplanting, the plants were harvested, and roots were separated from shoots. Shoot and root samples were oven-dried (65Â°C for 48 h) for the measurement of dry total biomass. AMF colonization of roots was quantified as described for experiment 1. Spores were separated from the soil by the wet-sieving method and counted using a microscope
