<p>This experiment was conducted to study the effects of AC on the symbioses between 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> and five AMF species respectively. In contrast to experiment 1, experiment 2 used sterilized soil that was subsequently inoculated with selected AMF. Based on the results from experiment 1 and the experiments of Zhang et al. 
 <xref rid="pone.0097163-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, which indicated that 
 <italic>Glomus</italic> was the dominant AMF genus in 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> roots, we used the following five 
 <italic>Glomus</italic> species in experiment 2: 
 <italic>G. mosseae</italic> (BGC501, XJ-01), 
 <italic>G. versiforme</italic> (BGC504, BJ08), 
 <italic>G. diaphanum</italic> (BGC506, SC05), 
 <italic>G. geosporum</italic> (BGC507, GZ01), and 
 <italic>G. etunicatum</italic> (BGC505, TW01). The AMF species were provided by the Glomales Germplasm Bank in China. These five 
 <italic>Glomus</italic> species existed naturally in abandoned fields where the seeds of 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> and 
 <italic>K. striata</italic> were collected 
 <xref rid="pone.0097163-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0097163-Tang1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Soil with spores was used as the inoculum for the experiment.
