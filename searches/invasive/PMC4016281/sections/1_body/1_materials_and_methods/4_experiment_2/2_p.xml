<p>Experiment 2 employed the following experimental design: two factors (AC and AMF) with five replicates (five blocks). The soil was the same as in experiment 1. AC was added to half of the microcosms at 20 ml l
 <sup>−1</sup> to absorb secondary compounds. After each microcosm was filled with 3 kg soil that had been sterilized by γ-radiation, an equal number of spores of each AMF species was mixed into the soil (one species per microcosm).
