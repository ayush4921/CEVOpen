<p>DGGE profiles showed that the AMF composition differed in invasive 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> versus native 
 <italic>K. striata</italic>. AC affected the pattern and signal intensity of bands of the 18S rDNA fragments of AMF in roots of 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> and 
 <italic>K. striata</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0097163.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). The phylogenetic analysis indicated that sequences retrieved from all root samples could be separated into six AMF groups (GA1â€“GA6) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0097163.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). AC treatments affected AMF phylotypes in 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> roots but not in 
 <italic>K. striata</italic> roots (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097163-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Roots of 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> were colonized by five AMF phylotypes when AC was not added (group GA4 was missing) and by four phylotypes when AC was added (GA2 and GA5 were missing) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097163-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). AMF phylotypes GA1, GA3, and GA6 in roots of 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> or 
 <italic>K. striata</italic> were not affected by the addition of AC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097163-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>).
