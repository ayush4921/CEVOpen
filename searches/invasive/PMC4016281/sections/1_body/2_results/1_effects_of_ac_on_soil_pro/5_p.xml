<p>The CCA-biplot showed that AC treatment significantly altered the AMF community structure of 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> but not of 
 <italic>K. striata</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097163-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). The CCA-biplot also demonstrated that the differences in AMF community structures of 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> between the No AC and AC treatments were more closely related to the three groups of secondary compounds (total flavones, total phenolics, and total saponins) than to soil properties.
