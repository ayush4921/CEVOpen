<p>Although substantial evidence demonstrates that invasive plants can affect AMF symbioses of local hosts via secondary metabolites

 <xref rid="pone.0097163-Scervino1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, whether those secondary metabolites can affect symbioses between AMF and the invasive plants themselves has not been documented. We address this question by using activated carbon (AC) to absorb secondary metabolites. Generally the effect of AC addition on plant growth and the formation of mutualistic relationships can reflect the putative role of secondary metabolites
