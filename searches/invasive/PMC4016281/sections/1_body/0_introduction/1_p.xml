 <xref rid="pone.0097163-Siemann2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Published studies have shown that invasive plants enhanced their competitive ability via the production of secondary metabolites

 <xref rid="pone.0097163-Alford1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Secondary metabolites can mediate invasive plants’ competition via strong effects on nutrient cycling

 <xref rid="pone.0097163-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. These influences could be mediated through directly and indirect ways.
