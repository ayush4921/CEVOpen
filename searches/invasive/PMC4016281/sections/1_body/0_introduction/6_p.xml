<p>We used the perennial herb 
 <italic>Solidago canadensis</italic> L. (goldenrod) as a model plant in our study. 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> is native to North America but forms a near monoculture in areas of China where it has invaded 
 <xref rid="pone.0097163-Weber1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> has a strong allelopathic effect on native plants and is always associated with AMF, making it suitable for testing our hypothesis 
 <xref rid="pone.0097163-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. In a previous study, we found that the concentrations of three main secondary metabolites in 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> plants were greater in the invaded range than in its native range and that these compounds substantially increased the competitive ability of 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> in the invaded range 
 <xref rid="pone.0097163-Yuan1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Experiments have also shown that invasive 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> is always associated with AMF and can alter the AMF community in ways that enhance its competitive ability 
 <xref rid="pone.0097163-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0097163-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. In the current study, we separated the indirect effects (i.e., those mediated by AMF) and direct effects (i.e., those not mediated by AMF) of secondary metabolites from 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> on the competition between 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> and a native plant.
