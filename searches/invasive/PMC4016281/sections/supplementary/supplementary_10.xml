   <bold>Phylogenetic tree of AMF communities in experiment 1.</bold> Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree based on partial SSU rRNA gene sequences of all identified AMF and referenced sequences in the root samples. Numbers above branches indicate bootstrap values from 1,000 replicates. The internal identification number represents sequences retrieved from specific DGGE profile bands. A total of 21 partial SSU rRNA sequences were thus obtained in the present study. They are shown in bold and labeled with the GeneBank database accession numbers (i.e., KC507871–KC507891). Sequence groups (GA1, GA2, etc.) identify distinct clusters of sequences with similarity ≥99%.
