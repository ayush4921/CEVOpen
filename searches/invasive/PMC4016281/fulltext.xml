Whether these secondary metabolites affect the invasive plant itself, directly or indirectly through microorganisms, however, has not been well documented. Here we tested whether activated carbon (AC), a well-known absorbent for secondary metabolites, affect arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbioses and competitive ability in an invasive plant. We conducted three experiments (experiments 1&#x02013;3) with the invasive forb <italic>Solidago canadensis</italic> and the native <italic>Kummerowia striata.</italic> Experiment 1 determined whether AC altered soil properties, levels of the main secondary metabolites in the soil, plant growth, and AMF communities associated with <italic>S. canadensis</italic> and <italic>K. striata</italic>. Experiment 2 determined whether AC affected colonization of <italic>S. canadensis</italic> by five AMF, which were added to sterilized soil. Experiment 3 determined the competitive ability of <italic>S. canadensis</italic> in the presence and absence of AMF and AC. In experiment 1, AC greatly decreased the concentrations of the main secondary metabolites in soil, and the changes in concentrations were closely related with the changes of AMF in <italic>S. canadensis</italic> roots. In experiment 2, AC inhibited the AMF <italic>Glomus versiforme</italic> and <italic>G. geosporum</italic> but promoted <italic>G. mosseae</italic> and <italic>G. diaphanum</italic> in the soil and also in <italic>S. canadensis</italic> roots. In experiment 3, AC reduced <italic>S. canadensis</italic> competitive ability in the presence but not in the absence of AMF. Our results provided indirect evidence that the secondary metabolites (which can be absorbed by AC) of the invasive plant <italic>S. canadensis</italic> may promote <italic>S. canadensis</italic> competitiveness by enhancing its own AMF symbionts.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (No. Z5090089) and the Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (RFDP, No. 20110101110077).

Secondary metabolites can mediate invasive plants&#x02019; competition via strong effects on nutrient cycling <xref rid="pone.0097163-Httenschwiler1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, native plants <xref rid="pone.0097163-Thorpe1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, and soil microbes <xref rid="pone.0097163-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. These influences could be mediated through directly and indirect ways.</p><p>The direct mediation of secondary metabolites from invasive plants on plant-plant competition can be best illustrated by observing native plants inhibiting their neighboring plants <xref rid="pone.0097163-Ens1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097163-Cipollini1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.

Secondary metabolites released from other invasive plants also directly inhibited seed germination of native plants <xref rid="pone.0097163-Ens1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097163-Cipollini1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The inhibition resulting from such direct effects can obviously increase the competitive ability of the invasive plant <xref rid="pone.0097163-Yuan1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>Secondary metabolites released by invasive plants also mediate competition indirectly. For example, secondary metabolites can indirectly promote the growth of invaders via influencing the nutrient cycling, like the pools and fluxes of inorganic and organic soil nutrient <xref rid="pone.0097163-Httenschwiler1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, or indirectly mediate competition via native soil microorganisms.

Such effects on soil microorganisms may alter the competition between invasive and native plants <xref rid="pone.0097163-Reinhart1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are important and ubiquitous soil microorganisms that form symbioses with many plant species in terrestrial ecosystems <xref rid="pone.0097163-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097163-Rillig1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.

For example, invasive Asian knapweed (<italic>Centaurea maculosa</italic>) in North America is able to tap into and benefit from the mycorrhizal network linking native plant roots <xref rid="pone.0097163-Marler1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097163-Carey1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Invasive <italic>Solidago canadensis</italic> in China can alter the AMF composition in the introduced range in ways that promote its competition against native plants <xref rid="pone.0097163-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In some cases, the secondary compounds released by invasive plants disrupt the symbioses between the AMF and native plants. For example, secondary chemicals released by the invasive plant <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic>, which cannot form symbioses with the AMF, disrupted the symbioses between native canopy tree seedlings and AMF <xref rid="pone.0097163-Stinson1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.

Additionally, the secondary compounds from <italic>A. petiolata</italic> not only inhibited AMF hyphal growth and spore germination <xref rid="pone.0097163-Cantor1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> but also altered the AMF community associated with native sugar maple seedlings <xref rid="pone.0097163-Barto1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>Although substantial evidence demonstrates that invasive plants can affect AMF symbioses of local hosts via secondary metabolites <xref rid="pone.0097163-Cantor1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097163-Akiyama1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097163-Scervino1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, whether those secondary metabolites can affect symbioses between AMF and the invasive plants themselves has not been documented. We address this question by using activated carbon (AC) to absorb secondary metabolites. Generally the effect of AC addition on plant growth and the formation of mutualistic relationships can reflect the putative role of secondary metabolites <xref rid="pone.0097163-Callaway2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>We used the perennial herb <italic>Solidago canadensis</italic> L.

Total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) in soil samples (1.0 g per sampling treatment) was determined with a San++ Continuous Flow Analyzer (Skalar, Netherlands). The pH of the soil from each sampling plot was measured using a soil&#x02013;water slurry (1&#x02236;5 soil:water).

AC at a rate of 20 ml l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> did not affect soil properties (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097163-t001">Table 1</xref>), and we therefore used AC at 20 ml l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in this study. The P and N concentration in the AC was 0 and 0.18%, respectively, and the pH was 6.0.

AMF colonization of roots was quantified using a microscope (&#x000d7;20 magnification) and utilizing the gridline intersection method <xref rid="pone.0097163-Giovannetti1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, and 200 transects were examined per replicate.</p><p>Soil samples in each microscope were air-dried and sieved for the test of soil properties. Soil properties were measured with the methods described in the preliminary experiment. Soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), available phosphorus (AP) and pH were tested. Three main secondary metabolites (total flavones, total phenolics, and total saponins) in the soil were also quantified using the methods described by Zhang et al. <xref rid="pone.0097163-Zhang3" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. First, the crude soil extracts were obtained by placing the 10-g sample in 100 ml of 70% ethanol and later, filtering the sample through a Whatman no. 44 filter paper.

Sequences were subsequently registered in the GenBank database under accession numbers KC507871&#x02013;KC507891. For the phylogenetic analysis, sequences with gaps were treated as missing data, and then a neighbor-joining tree (1,000 replicates) including the obtained sequences and their closest relatives from GenBank was constructed using MEGA version 4.0 with the Kimura 2-Parameter model. Sequences that were 2% different from each other were subsequently assigned to separate phylotypes.

<xref rid="pone.0097163-Siemann2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097163-Mahall1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097163-InderjitCallaway1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. AC, however, may also affect nutrient availability <xref rid="pone.0097163-LehmannJJr1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> and soil physio-chemical properties <xref rid="pone.0097163-Gundale1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097163-DeLuca1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097163-Matsubara1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Thus, when AC is used in research concerning plant secondary compounds, its putative effects should be checked carefully. In our experiment 1, addition of AC did not change the general soil properties (soil organic matter, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, available phosphorus and pH) but greatly reduced the concentrations of total flavones, phenolics, and saponins. CCA also indicated that variation in the AMF community in <italic>S. canadensis</italic> roots was more closely related to these secondary metabolites than to other soil properties and that these secondary metabolites enhanced the colonization of <italic>S. canadensis</italic> roots by certain AMF species (experiment 2). We therefore deduced that the effects of AC in our study resulted predominantly from the absorption of secondary metabolites by AC.</p><p>Our community similarity analysis demonstrated that through the absorption of secondary metabolites, AC affected the AMF community in the roots of <italic>S. canadensis</italic>. Although it was documented that secondary metabolites from invasive plants can affect AM symbiosis of neighboring plants <xref rid="pone.0097163-Stinson1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097163-Cantor1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, in our study, AC effects suggest that secondary metabolites from an invasive plant may promote its own AM symbiosis and thereby enhancing its own growth.</p><p>It remains unclear how plant secondary metabolites affect the process of AMF symbiosis <xref rid="pone.0097163-Callaway1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097163-Cantor1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097163-Akiyama1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097163-Buee1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. One plausible avenue could be that some compounds (e.g., flavones, sesquiterpenes, and strigolactones) could act as signals that induce AMF spore germination <xref rid="pone.0097163-Besserer1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, hyphal branching <xref rid="pone.0097163-Akiyama1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, and/or AM symbiosis formation <xref rid="pone.0097163-Scervino1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Flavones, phenolics, and saponins are commonly produced by many plants <xref rid="pone.0097163-Harborne1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097163-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. These three types of compounds had been reported to accumulate in the soil where <italic>S. canadensis</italic> had invaded <xref rid="pone.0097163-Zhang3" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Phenolics have been shown to reduce AMF colonization <xref rid="pone.0097163-Piotrowski1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, while flavones like chrysin and luteolin can promote AM symbiosis <xref rid="pone.0097163-Scervino1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In this study, AC greatly reduced the levels of three types of secondary metabolites, indicating that the effects of AC on AMF symbiosis in <italic>S. canadensis</italic> may be due to the decrease in the concentrations of secondary metabolites.</p><p>Interestingly, not all AMF species were affected in the same way by the secondary metabolites from <italic>S. canadensis</italic>. In experiment 2, for example, without the addition of AC, <italic>S. canadensis</italic> secondary compounds greatly enhanced the growth (as indicated by spore density and root colonization) of <italic>G. geosporum</italic> and <italic>G. versiforme</italic> but did not affect the growth of <italic>G. etunicatum</italic>. The DGGE data and the phylogenetic tree also indicated some AMF phylotypes were present in <italic>S. canadensis</italic> roots only when secondary metabolites had been absorbed by AC. These differential effects on AMF growth confirm that different AMF species can respond differently to the same chemicals. For example, spore germination of <italic>Glomus intraradices</italic> and <italic>G. claroideum</italic> can respond differently to strigolactones <xref rid="pone.0097163-Besserer1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. These results suggested that the development of symbioses between specific AMF and <italic>S. canadensis</italic> was mediated by <italic>S. canadensis</italic> secondary metabolites; this selective effect resulted in changes in the AMF community in the roots and also in the soil. In experiment 2, the beneficial AMF species <italic>G. geosporum</italic> and <italic>G. versiforme</italic> were able to promote greater growth of <italic>S. canadensis</italic> than the AMF species that were considered to be less beneficial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097163-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). These observations implied that <italic>S. canadensis</italic>&#x02019; secondary metabolites (which can be absorbed by AC in the soil) may specifically favor certain compatible AMF partners.</p><p>Results from experiment 3 showed that the competitive ability of invasive <italic>S. canadensis</italic> was influenced by both AC and AMF, i.e., release of chemicals by <italic>S. canadensis</italic> enhanced AMF colonization of <italic>S. canadensis</italic> roots. When AMF were absent, secondary metabolites did not increase the competitive ability of <italic>S. canadensis</italic> and autotoxicity might have been generated instead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097163-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). As a consequence, <italic>S. canadensis</italic> grew better with AC treatment than without AC treatment in the absence of AMF. Autotoxicity is also exhibited by other exotic plants, including <italic>Centaurea maculosa</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0097163-Perry1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, and this phenomenon is a way to reduce intraspecific competition. When AMF inoculum was added to the soil, however, the autotoxic effect was not evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097163-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>), and secondary metabolites enhanced the competitive ability of <italic>S. canadensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097163-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). These results suggested that AMF can offset the negative effects of secondary metabolites on <italic>S. canadensis</italic>. In other words, secondary metabolites indirectly promoted the competitive ability of <italic>S. canadensis</italic> via AMF. Given that secondary metabolites affected the degree of AMF colonization and the composition of the AMF community in the roots of the invasive <italic>S. canadensis</italic> but had little effect on AMF in the roots of the native <italic>K. striata</italic> in experiments 1 and 3, we concluded that the enhanced competitive ability of <italic>S. canadensis</italic> might have been the consequence of its own secondary metabolites affecting its own AM symbioses.</p><p>Secondary metabolites released by an invasive plant may enhance invasiveness by both direct and indirect effects. The direct effect involves the inhibition of native competitors through secondary metabolites without mediation by microorganisms. The indirect effect involves microorganisms that inhibit the native competitors or enhancing the invader <xref rid="pone.0097163-Reinhart1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097163-Cappuccino1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Although both field and common garden experiments have demonstrated that plant secondary metabolites can promote an invader&#x02019;s competitive ability, past research was unable to separate the direct effects from indirect, microbially mediated effects of invasive non-indigenous plants <xref rid="pone.0097163-Mangla1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. It follows that the reported impact of secondary metabolites on competition may in many or all cases have resulted from combined direct and indirect effects. In this study, we separated the direct and indirect effects of secondary metabolites on plant-plant competition using the intrinsic properties of activated carbon. Although our study was performed in microcosms and not in the field, it provided authentic evidence that plant secondary metabolites are able to enhance the competitive ability of an invader by increasing AMF colonization of the invader itself.</p><p>In conclusion, the effects of secondary metabolites produced by invasive plants on local plants have been well documented <xref rid="pone.0097163-Callaway1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, but few studies had focused on how secondary chemicals released by an invasive plant affect that invasive plant itself. Our study demonstrated an interesting phenomenon of &#x0201c;self-promotion&#x0201d; by a plant invader resulting from the positive effects of its own secondary metabolites on the AMF that colonize its roots. The results presented here further expanded our understanding of the interesting role of secondary metabolites during plant invasion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0097163.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
