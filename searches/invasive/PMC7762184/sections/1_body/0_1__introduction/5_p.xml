<p>In addition to visual inspection and beating sheet sampling, pheromone-baited traps can be used to monitor infestation levels and dispersal of 
 <italic>H. halys</italic>. The male-produced 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> aggregation pheromone is a mixture of two stereoisomers of 10,11-epoxy-1-bisabolen-3-ol (aggregation pheromone, hereafter). Traps have been baited with this aggregation pheromone and methyl (E,E,Z)-2,4,6-decatrienoate (MDT, hereafter), which resulted in an increased effect on field attraction of both adults and nymphs [

 <italic>H. halys</italic> in the USA, Europe, and Asia throughout the growing season [

 <italic>H. halys</italic>, mark-recapture studies using immunomarking technique have also been employed [

Insects are "marked" with a unique protein, either by direct contact during application or by picking up the protein via contact with previously marked surfaces, and subsequently analyzed for the specific protein by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [
