<p>Like most phytophagous pentatomids, 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> is polyphagous with a broad host range that includes over 170 plants in a wide range of plant families, many of agricultural importance, including various fruit, vegetables, row crops, and ornamentals [

 <xref rid="B7-insects-11-00866" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> feeds and often disperses on a wide range of plants during the season, hosts vary in suitability and acceptability. Both adults and nymphs prefer to feed on plant reproductive structures, which are often required to complete development [
 <xref rid="B1-insects-11-00866" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In addition, multiple host plant species are needed for optimal 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> development [
 <xref rid="B8-insects-11-00866" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. 
 <italic>Halyomorpha halys</italic> also has a strong dispersal capacity; adults can fly long distances and spread at landscape level to locate mature fruit to feed on [
