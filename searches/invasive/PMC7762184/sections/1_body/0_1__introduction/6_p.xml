<p>The present study aimed, therefore, at investigating the dispersal capacity and behavior of overwintered adults of 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> in relation to host plants before the colonization of hazelnut crop, which is one of the most important crops in north-western Italy, as well as one of the most damaged by 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> [
 <xref rid="B4-insects-11-00866" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Specifically, research was carried out in four polyculture areas in north-western Italy, by using (i) pheromone-baited traps to monitor 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> populations leaving the overwintering refuges for crop colonization, (ii) visual inspection and beating sheet sampling to assess its distribution and abundance on early host plants, and (iii) an immunomarking-capture technique to track its movement and dispersal behavior from overwintering refuges and/or early host plants before hazelnut crop colonization at the landscape scale.
