<p>In north-western Italy, adults usually start to exit from overwintering sites in March–early April, with numbers peaking in late spring (May–early June) depending on environmental conditions. Little is known about their behavior at this time; host plant resources are limited, whereas their flight capacity is high, therefore resulting in long-distance dispersal of

 <xref rid="B1-insects-11-00866" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], a better understanding of its preferred host plants and of its dispersal behavior in early spring may assist in developing successful pest management strategies. Since alternative host plants are significant for stink bug development and can be essential for population build-up before dispersing to agricultural crops [
 <xref rid="B18-insects-11-00866" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], identification of early and alternative host plants can be exploited to develop farm scale programmes aimed at
