<p>Moreover, numbers of marked adults did not decrease with distance; overall they were found in all zones of each area, in different amounts but irrespective of the distance. First of all, the results suggest how 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> adults are capable of both short- and long-range dispersal from overwintering sites and/or early host plants to next host and cultivated plants. Second, their movement patterns may not depend mainly on the distance from the sources but on the ecosystem features, and plant host distribution and availability. Therefore, 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> is likely to perform short- or long-distance flights, implying a large movement within the agroecosystem [

 <xref rid="B12-insects-11-00866" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-insects-11-00866" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], in each area there was a fraction of adults marked with both proteins confirming the high mobility within the landscape. In our case, double-marked individuals demonstrate that 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> appear to move from anthropic overwintering sites to early host plants, or more unlikely vice versa. Although a contamination between individuals cannot be completely excluded, it is unlikely. In fact, in spring, after leaving overwintering refuges, adults tend to disperse rather than to aggregate in large groups as during summer. Moreover, most adults were collected on traps, probably before they could form aggregations.
