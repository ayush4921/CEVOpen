In June, nymphs were found only on a few plants, such as peach, ivy, walnut, red mulberry, wheat, black locust, false indigo-bush, European spindletree, common dogwood, maple, and hazelnut. In the investigated areas, hazelnut is both a wild plant widespread in natural habitats, and a crop plant growing in commercial orchards. This species was either one of the first favorite transitional host plants early in the season, and was also a reproductive host, usually from June, when fruits become available and also susceptible to stink bug damage [

 <xref rid="B33-insects-11-00866" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Movement from and to hazelnut plants, both wild and cultivated, occurred across all the sampling period. Obviously, this fact further complicates the pest management in hazelnut orchards, due to the continuous crop colonization by adults, in addition to the presence of all pest stages from mid-June to mid-August, when the local grown variety is usually harvested.
