<p>In this study, relationships between 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> and host plants, and adult dispersal capacity in the spring were investigated in four areas of north-western Italy. At a landscape scale, the general features of these areas, like climate, altitude, presence of forest margins, natural corridors among the crops, buildings, water courses and main roads, were quite homogeneous. Consequently, the relative abundance of 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> was similar among the areas. Wallner et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-insects-11-00866" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] found 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> displayed strong associations with urban factors, such as railroads, and other landscape/land use features that included deciduous forests and wetlands. In our study, analyzing data of captures by each trap in relation to the distances from the closest source of water, main roads and buildings, no differences were recorded between the numbers of bugs collected by traps in the different zones in each area. The zones in the four areas were also similar in terms of the presence of available host plants, even if in different amounts. As suggested by Kirkpatrick et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-insects-11-00866" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], the influence of host plants must be considered when interpreting how 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> responds to pheromone-baited traps and, perhaps, the similar behavioral response to pheromonal stimuli recorded in each zone could also be attributed to similarities in host plant composition.
