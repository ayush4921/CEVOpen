<p>In addition to identifying the favorite host plants, the assessment of dispersal behavior and distribution of overwintered adults in the agroecosystem is crucial to implement sustainable pest management strategies. In fact, active dispersal by adults was observed season-long resulting in crop injury with strong edge effects in multiple commodities at a regional scale [
 <xref rid="B14-insects-11-00866" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; however, there is a gap between the time period in which 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> disperses from overwintering sites and when it appears in agricultural crops, specifically tree bearing fruit. The immunomarking-capture was already tested and used as a useful and relevant technique to study 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> moving within an orchard or between adjacent crops [

 <xref rid="B21-insects-11-00866" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Here, this technique was applied to a wider landscape scale, in order to track movements from overwintering refuges to early host plants, and then to crops, particularly hazelnut. Despite the increased study area, overall a high number of collected bugs (44%) was positive for the markers, indicating that this technique can be usefully adopted to study 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> dispersal on a wider scale. Indeed, there was evidence of long-range capture of marked adults up to 950 m (for albumin) and 650 m (for casein), i.e., the maximum range of tested distances. Since there were no distances at which no marked adults were found, future studies should include a wider range of distances. Indeed, the surface area of the study areas reached up to 50 ha. This could mean that 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> adults need a wider area for their first dispersal flights in search of plants to feed on, confirming its strong dispersal capacity [
