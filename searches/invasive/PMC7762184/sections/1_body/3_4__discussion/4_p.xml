 <italic>Halyomorpha halys</italic> adults that disperse from overwintering sites begin to arrive on host plants in April through to May, and temporarily use transitional host plants, such as trees within the forest edge habitats, before following the availability of fruiting structures and colonize crops [

 <xref rid="B31-insects-11-00866" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Similarly, starting from mid-April, adults were sampled on wild plants, such as hybrid plane, European spindletree, walnut, oak and European elder, which were common in forest edge and were not fruiting at that period. Consistently with studies in the native area [
 <xref rid="B6-insects-11-00866" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], from May, 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> was found also on plants bearing fruit, particularly on peach, mulberry and apple, while from June, it spread to many wild and crop plants, reaching hazelnut orchards; therefore, more adults were sampled, due to the increased availability of fruiting plants. In particular, some species, such as common ash, maple, hazelnut, cherry, walnut, black locust and bloody dogwood, are both favorite host plants and widespread in natural corridors in agroecosystems of north-western Italy, therefore, worthy to be considered important for dispersal of 
 <italic>H. halys</italic>.
