<p>Naturally, 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> population levels are affected by the local climatic conditions. In northern Italy, adults successfully exit from overwintering refuges when daily maximum temperatures exceed 14 °C, and females start ovipositing in mid-May and continue until mid-August [

Similarly, overwintered adults were captured in traps from mid-April, with an average temperature of 14.2 °C, and first nymphs were trapped from mid-June onwards. The abundance of overwintered adults, starting from their exit from refuges until reproduction, is influenced by temperatures, since captures peaked in late April, which corresponded to higher mean temperatures recorded in each area. Then, independently of weather condition, usually from July, populations grew due to the gradual increase of nymphs, and reached the highest levels from mid-July, when overwintered adults and first generation individuals overlapped.
