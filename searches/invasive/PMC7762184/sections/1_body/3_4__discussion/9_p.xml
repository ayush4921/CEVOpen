<p>Although stability of the two markers over time was not specifically tested, ELISA results showed more than double albumin positive specimens than casein positive ones, in compliance to what previously observed [

 <xref rid="B23-insects-11-00866" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-insects-11-00866" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Jones et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-insects-11-00866" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] demonstrated that over a 19-day period significantly lower percentages of marked pear psylla adults were casein positive. In addition to casein stability over time, a second cause could be attributed to 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> behavior. It is well known the potential for 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> to be marked either directly or to a lesser extent through direct contact with a previously marked surface [
 <xref rid="B12-insects-11-00866" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Having treated possible anthropic overwintering sites with milk solution, the chances to reach directly overwintering adults were quite limited as it was unlikely that adults coming from different sites could have passed by human-made structures. On the other hand, egg solution was sprayed on possible natural overwintering sites and early host plants, which could be likely visited by higher numbers of 
 <italic>H. halys</italic>, after leaving anthropic sites and seeking plants to feed on. Indeed, higher amounts of albumin positives were generally collected in the second period (from mid-May onwards), when overwintered adults left the refuges, and were present on early host plants. The early-season movement pattern of 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> was particularly evident in Area 3. During April, all marked insects were casein positive or double protein positive: they came from anthropic overwintering sites, either directly or passing by early host plants. From May, casein and double protein positive adults almost disappeared (with few double-marked specimens): overwintered population left refuges and spread on plants, as evidenced by the percentages of albumin positives doubled throughout the Area 3. Here, casein was sprayed on a suitable overwintering site, where relatively high percentages of adults were reached (on average 27%), while albumin was sprayed on favorite early host plants (ivy, black locust, oak, chestnut) which were not natural overwintering sites. This result corroborates the potential of the immunomarking-capture technique to study dispersal behavior of 
 <italic>H. halys</italic>, as assessed for other species [
