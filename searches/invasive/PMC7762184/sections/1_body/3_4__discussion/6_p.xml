<p>The qualitative analysis of each area shows that the presence of 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> on a given plant species may change in relation to the floral composition in the zone. For example, in Area 2 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> adults were never found on walnut, whereas they were collected on maple and European spindletree nearby. Furthermore, on cherry, their abundance was variable in some zones, in relation to neighboring host plants. Moreover, although sunflower is reported as a potential trap crop for 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> on pepper [

 <xref rid="B34-insects-11-00866" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], it was never collected on this crop species during the growing season; however, in Area 3 sunflower was grown next to hazelnut orchards, which were probably more attractive. This finding leads to the importance of considering each agroecosystem for its peculiarities and floral composition; in fact, the existence of a large variety of plant species seems to be more relevant than the presence of a single possible attractive host plant species.
