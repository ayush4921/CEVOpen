<p>To assess early host plants and track movement of 
 <italic>H. halys</italic>, in each area, from 8 to 9 zones were selected because of one or more of the following characteristics: (i) presence of host plants for stink bug sampling, either in natural habitats or cultivated plots; (ii) presence of the pheromone trap; (iii) presence of potential overwintering refuges, either human-made or natural, and/or early host plants to be used for the immunomarking study. Zones were tagged with capital letters (A–H or A–I) and are reported for each area in
