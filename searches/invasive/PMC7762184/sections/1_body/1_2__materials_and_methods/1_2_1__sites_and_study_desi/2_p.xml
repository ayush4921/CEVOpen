<p>Six pheromone traps were arranged radially around the hypothetical overwintering site, with a radius of 150–200 m in Area 1 (14 ha), 300–400 m in Area 2 (28 ha), and 400–500 m in Areas 3 and 4 (48 and 50 ha, respectively). Distance from the area centre and traps varied taking into account the size and shape of cultivated plots, in order to place the traps on the border of crop plots, and not in their centre. SAGA GIS-Module Grid Proximity program was used to calculate the Euclidian distance between each trap and the closest feature considered: (i) a source of water (i.e., river); (ii) main road suitable for vehicles (i.e., secondary suburban road); and (iii) building (
