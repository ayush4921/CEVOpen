<p>Trials were performed in four polyculture areas located in Piedmont, north-western Italy, in 2018. Each area was 14 to 50 ha and included different crops and natural habitats, both uncultivated corridors and forest margins (
 <xref rid="insects-11-00866-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In each area, relatively high infestation levels of 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> on crops were recorded during the previous season; moreover, high numbers of overwintering bugs were also recovered in the closest human structures (buildings, woodsheds, storehouses, and heaps of rubble). The study design was conceived for each area in order to include one hypothetical overwintering site, usually a human building, approximately in the middle of the area.
