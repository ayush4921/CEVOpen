<p>Mean numbers of stink bug adults collected per plant (sampling unit) in the four areas were analyzed for differences in relation to (i) the fruiting or vegetative stage of plants, both for the whole period and for each single period; (ii) the lure proximity (&lt; 5 m) across the whole period; (iii) the major crops from May to late June. After tests of homogeneity of variance (Levene) and normality (Shapiro–Wilk), one-way ANOVA was performed for points (i) and (ii), whereas the non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test was used for point (iii) because data were inhomogeneous (IBM SPSS Statistics 25).</p>
