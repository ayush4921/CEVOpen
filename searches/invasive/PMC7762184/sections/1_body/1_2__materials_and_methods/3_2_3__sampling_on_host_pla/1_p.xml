<p>During surveys between early/mid-April and mid-/late June, wild and cultivated host plants in each area were identified and inspected for the presence of 
 <italic>H. halys</italic>. Stink bugs were sampled by visual inspection, followed by scouting branches or stems with a cane on a beating sheet (0.7 Ã— 0.7 m). Due to the different size and shape, the plants were visually inspected for 1 min and then scouted on sheet five times (sampling unit). Moreover, data of sampling were attributed to 10-day intervals for each month as follows: (I) from 1st to 10th day; (II) from 11th to 20th day; and (III) from 21st to 30th or 31st day.
