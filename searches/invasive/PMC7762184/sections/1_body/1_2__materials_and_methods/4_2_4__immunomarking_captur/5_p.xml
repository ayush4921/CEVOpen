<p>Immunomarking-capture results of each area were evaluated by considering the distances between the sampling zones and the zone of treatment. Sampling dates were pooled together, when the captured adults were considered to have undergone the same treatment or a repetition of it (approximately in the one-month interval). Adults collected in the same area, zone and sampling period were grouped. To compare data among the four areas, each sampling date was attributed to a 10-day interval as explained above. Percentages of samples marked with albumin, or with casein, or with both, or unmarked were arcsine square-root-transformed and analyzed with one-way ANOVA, using areas, zones and 10-day periods as the main factor. Means were separated at
