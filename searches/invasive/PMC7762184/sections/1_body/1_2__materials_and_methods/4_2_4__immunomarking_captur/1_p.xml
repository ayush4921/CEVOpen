<p>To track the movement of bugs between overwintering sites, early host plants and crops, an immunomarking-capture technique was adopted. The two unique protein-markers, albumin and casein, were used in the form of tap water solution of 10% liquid egg white and 20% skimmed milk, respectively. The protein solutions were misted on host plants or overwintering sites, with a 14 L motorized backpack sprayer (SR450, Stihl S.p.A., Cambiago, Italy). In particular, milk solution was used to mark possible anthropic overwintering sites such as shelters, piles of rubbles and woodshed, while egg white solution was misted on possible natural overwintering sites or early host plants, such as oak, ivy, and black locust. Only in Area 2, protein solutions were used to mark wild hazelnut in the forest side (albumin) and cultivated hazelnut in the orchard (casein) (
