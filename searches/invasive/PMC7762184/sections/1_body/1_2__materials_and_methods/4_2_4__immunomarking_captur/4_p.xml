 <xref rid="B21-insects-11-00866" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Rabbit anti-casein (RAC, GTX37769, GeneTex, Irvine, CA, USA; 16 μL into 8 mL of PBSS-BS20 for each microplate) and rabbit anti-egg (RAE, C6534, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; 2 μL into 8 mL PBSS-BS20 for each microplate) were used as the primary antibody for casein and albumin, respectively. For both egg white and milk assays, donkey anti-rabbit (DAR, A120-108P, Bethyl Laboratories, Inc., Montgomery, TX, USA; 1.4 μL into 8.4 mL PBSS-BS20 for each microplate) was used as the secondary antibody. PBST (Phosphate buffered saline + 0.09% Triton X-100, Triton-X-100, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and PBS-SDS (Phosphate buffered saline + 2.3 g L
 <sup>−1</sup> sodium dodecyl sulfate) were used as washing solutions. TBS-EDTA (Tris-buffered saline pH 8.0 + 0.3 g L
 <sup>−1</sup> ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), PBSS-BS20 (Phosphate buffered saline + 20% bovine serum + 1300 ppm Silweet L-77, Silwet, Chemtura Manufacturing, Manchester, UK) and 2N H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> were used as reagents. Ultra-TMB (34028, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) was used as substrate solution.
