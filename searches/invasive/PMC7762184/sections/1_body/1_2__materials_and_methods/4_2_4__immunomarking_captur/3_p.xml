<p>In the laboratory, indirect enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assays (ELISA) were performed to detect the presence of markers (casein and albumin) on the samples. During each assay, adults were simultaneously analyzed for the presence of each protein, by using two 96-well microplates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), one for casein and one for albumin. At the same time, 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> adults collected from traps in a site 10 km away from the closest experimental area were used both directly as negative controls, and after soaking them in a solution of milk or egg white with plastic disposable tweezers, as positive controls. Each microplate was loaded with 29 samples of adults (3 wells for each sample), and the relative positive, negative, and buffer-only controls, each repeated in three wells.
