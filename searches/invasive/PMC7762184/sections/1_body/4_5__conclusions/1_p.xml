<p>This research provided information on early host plants and dispersal behavior of 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> before crop colonization. Depending on ecosystem features and host plant availability, overwintered adults were capable of both short- and long-range dispersal, as assessed by immunomarking-capture. In addition to early host plants, 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> adults proved to respond effectively to pheromone as soon as they left overwintering refuges. Therefore, the attractiveness of commercial lures coupled with the retention time given by the plants can be exploited to manage the pest early in the season.
