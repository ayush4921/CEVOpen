<p>Among the six traps the range of distances fluctuated: (i) from a minimum of 117 m in Area 4 to a maximum of 556 m in Area 2 for the closest source of water; (ii) from 131 m in Area 1 to 754 m in Area 4 for the closest main roads; and (iii) from 150 m in Area 1 to 251 m in Area 4 for the closest buildings (

Results of one-way ANOVA on mean daily captures by traps in relation to the distances from the closest source of water, main roads and buildings did not show any significant difference, in the numbers of males, females, adults (males + females), nymphs and total population (adults + nymphs) (
