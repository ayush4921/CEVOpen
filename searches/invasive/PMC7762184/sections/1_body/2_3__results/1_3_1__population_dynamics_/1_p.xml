Overall, mean daily captures ranged from 0.01 to 0.58, with a peak occurring in late April, concurrently with an unusual increase in the average temperature (18.6 °C). Nymphs appeared in all areas in June. Significant differences in mean daily captures of adults between sampling dates were recorded by one-way ANOVA in Area 2 (F (6, 35) = 7.168,
