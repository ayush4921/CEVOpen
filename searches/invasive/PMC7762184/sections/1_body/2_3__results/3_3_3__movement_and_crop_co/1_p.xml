<p>Overall, 597 adults collected either on traps or on host plants in the four areas were analyzed by ELISA. Of these, 30% was albumin positive, 14% was casein positive, and 9% was positive for both markers. The mean percentages of marked and unmarked specimens grouped per sampling date from April to June, and per sampling zone, were not significantly different among the four investigated areas (ANOVA: albumin: F (3, 104) = 1.866, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.140; casein: F (3, 110) = 1.942, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.127; albumin + casein: F (3, 104) = 1.991, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.120; unmarked: F (3, 110) = 2.116, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.102), neither between the zones in the investigated areas (ANOVA: albumin: F (7, 100) = 0.462, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.860; casein: F (7, 106) = 0.845, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.553; albumin + casein: F (7, 100) = 0.294, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.955; unmarked: F (7, 106) = 0.653, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.711).
