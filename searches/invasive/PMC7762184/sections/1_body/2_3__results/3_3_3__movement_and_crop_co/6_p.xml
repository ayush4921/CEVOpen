<p>The percentages of marked 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> in the eight zones of Area 4, for the period from 19 April to 17 May and from 18 May to 22 June are reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-11-00866-f008">Figure 8</xref>a,b, respectively. Milk solution was sprayed three times in the same overwintering site, whereas egg white solution was sprayed two times on plants considered as host of 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> in each period (
 <xref rid="insects-11-00866-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). From late April to mid-May, adults marked with casein or adults marked with albumin were found up to 450 m and 670 m away from the zone of treatment, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-11-00866-f008">Figure 8</xref>a). From late May to late June, the maximum distance at which marked adults were collected increased up to 510 m for casein and 690 m for albumin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-11-00866-f008">Figure 8</xref>b). Moreover, the total number of sampled adults almost doubled in the second period (from 55 to 91), and percentages of adults marked with albumin increased from 11% to 39%. Overall, 8% of tested adults were positive for both casein and albumin in the two considered periods. None of the tested adults was positive to casein on 22 June, 44 days after the treatment was applied on 9 May.
