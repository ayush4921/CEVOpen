<p>The percentages of marked 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> in the eight zones of Area 3, for the period from 5 to 27 April and from 28 April to 30 May are reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-11-00866-f007">Figure 7</xref>a,b, respectively. In April, almost all specimens (43 out of 44) were collected on 27 April, after both treatments with casein in a potential overwintering site and the treatment with albumin on plants considered as early hosts of 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> (
 <xref rid="insects-11-00866-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Adults marked with casein or marked with both albumin and casein were found up to 650 m and 950 m away from the zone of treatment, respectively. Nevertheless, none of the tested adults was positive only to albumin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-11-00866-f007">Figure 7</xref>a). In late Aprilâ€“May, adults marked with casein (either casein alone or casein and albumin) were found in three out of the eight zones, but at distances up to 650 m from treatment site (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-11-00866-f007">Figure 7</xref>b). From the first to the second period, total percentages of adults marked with casein decreased (from 27% to 7%), whereas those with albumin increased (from 23% to 45%). On average 23% and 7% of tested adults were positive to both casein and albumin in the first and second period, respectively. Moreover, adults that were positive to one or both markers were found up to 42 days after the treatment on 18 April.
