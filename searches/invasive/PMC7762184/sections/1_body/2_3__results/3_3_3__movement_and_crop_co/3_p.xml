 <xref rid="insects-11-00866-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), adults marked with casein were found only in three zones up to 360 m, with the highest amounts in the zone of treatment, while adults marked with albumin were more numerous (on average 36%) compared to the first period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-11-00866-f005">Figure 5</xref>b), and found in zones up to 420 m. The 6% of tested adults were positive to both casein and albumin in both sampling periods.
