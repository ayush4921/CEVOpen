<p>Some host plant species (no. 13) were located also in the proximity (i.e., â‰¤ 5 m) of the lures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-11-00866-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Due to the potential interaction between the lure and the host plant, these plant species were considered separately from the same species farther away. Overall, mean values of the adults collected across the sampling period were significantly higher on all the plants located within 5 m from the lures compared to all the plants of the same species located farther from the lures (ANOVA: F (1, 28) = 18.051, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Although each species nearby hosted higher values of 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> adults compared to the same species far away, significant differences were recorded only on hazelnut (ANOVA: F (1, 11) = 6.670, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.025), black locust (
 <italic>Robinia pseudoacacia</italic> L.) (ANOVA: F (1, 11) = 14.203, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.003) and walnut (ANOVA: F (1, 11) = 17.279, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.002) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-11-00866-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The sampling periods (no. 7) did not affect the factor proximity/distance from the lure (ANOVA; F (6, 145) = 1.659, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.135).
