<p>Host plants were evaluated for the presence of fruit during the sampling period. In total, 14 species were bearing fruit at different ripening stages on at least one sampling date, whereas the remaining species were present in a vegetative stage (
 <xref rid="insects-11-00866-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Independently of the period, the presence of fruit resulted a significant factor for the mean density of 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> (mean numbers of adults per plant per sampling date) (ANOVA: F (1, 22) = 12.358, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.002). Differences in abundance of 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> between fruiting or vegetative stages were recorded in the following 10-day periods: II May (ANOVA: F (1, 24) = 6.722, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.016), I June (ANOVA: F (1, 21) = 5.371, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.031), and II June (ANOVA: F (1, 21) = 17.581, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Among fruiting plant species, crops presenting fruit from early May to late June, i.e., apple, cherry, peach, and hazelnut, were compared for 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> abundance. Although on cherry seasonal abundance was quite stable across the sampling period, on other crops population levels generally fluctuated (

 <sup>2</sup> = 3.053; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.383; 
 <italic>N</italic> = 22).
