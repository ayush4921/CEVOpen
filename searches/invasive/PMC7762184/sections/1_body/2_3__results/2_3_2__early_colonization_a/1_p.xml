<p>Floral composition, including crops (
 <xref rid="insects-11-00866-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and wild plants, was different in the four study areas. In particular, some host plants were present in almost every area, whereas others were linked to a specific area, like bay tree (
 <italic>Laurus nobilis</italic> L.), hybrid plane (
 <italic>Platanus x hispanica</italic> Mill ex MÃ¼nchh.), false indigo-bush (
 <italic>Amorpha fruticosa</italic> L.), fig (
 <italic>Ficus carica</italic> L.), peach (
 <italic>Prunus persica</italic> (L.) Batsch) and American pokeweed (
 <italic>Phytolacca americana</italic> L.) (
 <xref rid="insects-11-00866-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In total, 491 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> bugs (462 adults and 29 nymphs) were sampled on plants in the four areas between mid-April and mid-/late June. As few nymphs were collected in the sampling period, only adults were considered in the following analyses; moreover, adults sampled on plants located nearby (less than 5 m) pheromone lures were not considered here. Qualitative evaluation on the numbers of adults per plant collected across the sampling period revealed that peach, common ash (
 <italic>Fraxinus excelsior</italic> L.), red mulberry (
 <italic>Morus rubra</italic> L.), apple (
 <italic>Malus domestica</italic> Borkh.), maple (
 <italic>Acer</italic> spp.) hybrid plane and hazelnut (
 <italic>Corylus avellana</italic> L.) were major host plants (from 15.3 to 2.8 adults per plant collected in total), followed by cherry (
 <italic>Prunus avium</italic> (L.) L.), ivy (
 <italic>Hedera helix</italic> L.), walnut (
 <italic>Juglans regia</italic> L.), poplar (
 <italic>Populus</italic> spp.), and European spindletree (
 <italic>Euonymus europaeus</italic> L.). Hybrid plane, European spindletree, oak (
 <italic>Quercus</italic> spp.), walnut, and European elder (
 <italic>Sambucus nigra</italic> L.) were the first host plants of the season, on which adults were collected in April. In contrast, 
 <italic>H. halys</italic> was never collected on hawthorn (
 <italic>Crataegus monogyna</italic> Jacq.) (Areas 1, 2, 4), rose (
 <italic>Rosa canina</italic> L.) (Areas 1, 2), lime (
 <italic>Tilia</italic> spp.) (Area 1), Asian knotweed (
 <italic>Reynoutria japonica</italic> Houtt.) (Area 3), privet (
 <italic>Ligustrum</italic> sp.) (Area 3), and sunflower (
 <italic>Helianthus annuus</italic> L.) (Area 3). Both adults and nymphs were frequently found on maize (
 <italic>Zea mays</italic> L.) but only later in the season.
