<p>Cover-weighted FQI rose from 6 to 20 and was the only metric whose mid-survey dip appeared to affect its overall statistical significance (

In other words, it appears that an exogenous factor—most probably these mid-survey dips—overrode the ability of time alone to explain the trend, as evidenced by weaker significance values compared to the non-weighted FQI model, despite similar magnitudes in the two metrics’ overall, upward trends.
