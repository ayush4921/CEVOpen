<p>For species richness, the best model included a lag term, which indicates that species richness changed according to a predictable pattern based on the prior yearâ€™s value. Adding a time component to the model did not appreciably improve the model fit, suggesting that species richness was neither increasing nor decreasing over time, but instead remained steady at around 15 species per plot (
