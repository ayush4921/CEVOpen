<p>While regional white-tailed deer population numbers have been extraordinarily high for some time [

In accordance, FPCC census counts estimated deer numbers in the area had risen to more than 62 deer per km

By 1994, these programs had brought the numbers down substantially (unpublished FPCC data). Deer culling has continued since then.
