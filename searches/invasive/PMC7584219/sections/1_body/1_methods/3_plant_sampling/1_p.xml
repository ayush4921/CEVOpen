<p>Fifteen circular, 1-m
 <sup>2</sup> permanent plots were established in 1986, beginning at a random location and continuing at 10-m intervals along a 150-m linear transect through Vestal Grove. The transect was marked by metal posts placed at 50-m intervals. Plots were placed one meter north of the transect. Species name and direct estimates of percent aerial cover for all herbaceous plants were recorded, as well as of those woody plants with foliage below one meter tall. In order to represent both early and later season flora, plots were sampled twiceâ€“in late spring and late summer. To compile a single sample, the species lists from the two plot samples were combined and, if a species was sampled at both times, the larger cover value was used. The transect was sampled roughly every two years.
