<p>This study adds to the growing body of work demonstrating the effectiveness of ecological management of oak woodlands that includes regular fire, control of invasive species and overabundant deer, and repeated additions of a diverse seed mix. Our study underscores the importance of continued, long-term management to achieve restorations that approach remnant quality, and it illustrates the speed with which vegetation communities can respond (negatively) to neglect and (positively) to management. This study found that per-plot, Cover-weighted FQI, which incorporates species richness, abundance, and conservatism, may be a particularly useful and versatile metric to describe both short-term and long-term changes in plant communities. Breaking the data into conservatism classes helped us detail and further understand the compositional changes in the plant community over time.</p>
