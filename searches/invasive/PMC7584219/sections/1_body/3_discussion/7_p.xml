<p>Our study did not attempt to isolate contributions from the individual management techniques (fire, seed additions, invasive species control, etc.). Many other studies have examined the impact of single management treatments, and on their own they tend to lead to modest Floristic Quality gains (fire [

Therefore, our results suggest that a combination is necessary to achieve restoration outcomes of this magnitude, especially in modern ecosystem contexts. Nonetheless, studies with controlled comparisons of different management techniques are needed to sort out the long-term effects of particular treatments, as well as their interactions, on biodiversity or conservation measures.
