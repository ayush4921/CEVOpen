<p>To summarize the results for each of this study’s objectives: First, we found successful restoration of a degraded oak woodland’s plant community under a long-term, multi-treatment, ecological management regime. Second, of the common metrics studied, Floristic Quality measures most accurately quantified the management success/failure and restoration progress over the life of the study. Third, an abrupt, mid-study cessation of the management treatments stalled or even reversed the woodlands recovery, which then quickly resumed its overall upward progress once management resumed. And, finally, the abundance-weighted Floristic Quality measure, Cover-weighted FQI, was the most sensitive restoration measure: it quickly responded to the mid-study management cessation, which may make it most useful for restoration work that needs to quickly detect and adjust to community changes (i.e., adaptive management).</p>
