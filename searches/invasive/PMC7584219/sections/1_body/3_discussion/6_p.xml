<p>Our results strongly suggest that it was the long-term and multi-faceted management regime that explained the remarkable woodland restoration success. The management regime included removal of invasive herbaceous weeds, cutting and herbiciding invasive shrubs and trees, deer control, prescribed fire, and seeding. This study did not test the management-restoration relationship with a spatially replicated, no-management control. However, three strong lines of evidence nonetheless support the treatments as causative. First, unmanaged woods within the same preserve and directly adjacent to the study area showed essentially no change from the highly degraded pre-treatment condition of the study area over the same 34-year period, based on stewards’ observations. These untreated areas have seen none of the return or recovery of the native floras documented in the managed study area. Second, other studies have shown that when left alone, degraded oak forests/woodlands will not recover their previous habitat quality (native diversity and composition of the ground layer flora measured over even centuries), even if they are directly abutted by high-quality, “old-growth” woodland seed sources [

And, since this no-management period resulted in an immediate, observable dampening in the overall upward trend in conservation measures, and since they quickly rebounded once ecological management resumed (Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0241061.g004">4</xref>), this unplanned control period provides strong evidence for the causal effects of management. Taken together, these arguments clearly implicate the site’s management regime as the determinant factor in the measured response variables, and, therefore, in the restoration success. It shows that neglect, or relying on time and succession, will not lead to natural area restoration, especially in the highly-degraded, developed landscape characterizing the study region.
