<p>Over the 34-year study period, the vegetation of Vestal Grove has changed from a biologically depauperate woodland dominated by non-native species to a community with Floristic Quality measures essentially undistinguishable from the highest quality remnants of this habitat type. The native Mean

The initial value is typical of other highly degraded, non-native dominated habitats (e.g., abandoned farm fields, pastures), whereas the final value approaches levels seen in the finest undegraded, remnant natural areas in the regionâ€”surpassing what has typically been observed in restorations [
