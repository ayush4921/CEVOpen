<p>Restoration and conservation of the biodiversity of oak savannas and woodlands face difficult challenges. As stated by Bowles and McBride [
 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], “Fire-maintained oak savannas on silt-loam [rich] soils essentially disappeared from midwestern North America soon after European settlement because of fire suppression and agriculture. As a result, there are no precise models for restoring this vegetation, and its management and recovery needs are uncertain.” Though northern Illinois has many small (0.1 to 2-hectare [0.25 to 5-acre]), high-quality prairie remnants on rich soils, dense with conservative plant species, no such savanna/woodland remnants survive [
 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. On the other hand, many large, albeit degraded savanna/woodland remnants survive (e.g., 20 to 200-hectare [50 to 500-acre]), and conservation has focused on these areas because they are large and ripe for restoration.
