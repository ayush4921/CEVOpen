<p>Species richness and evenness provide intuitive, relevant measures that can be easily understood and communicated. Many studies have relied solely on species richness or evenness as a measure of diversity (e.g., [
 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]), and they can be somewhat responsive to management (fire [
 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]; deer control [
 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]; fire and thinning [
 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]), or relatively unaffected by them (deer control [
 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]).
