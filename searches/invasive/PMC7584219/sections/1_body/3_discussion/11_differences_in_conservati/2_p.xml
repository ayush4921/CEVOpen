<p>This ability to detect ecosystem degradation or changes in restoration trajectory sooner than other ecological metrics could be crucial to land managers’ ‘real-time’ decision making. For example, Cover-weighted FQI’s apparent reflection of overabundant deer or excessive invasive species could warn land managers of reductions in the size or robustness of browsed or shaded species before their populations are eliminated from a site. However, there are also reasons why abundance-weighted measures may be less appropriate for long-term assessments of the Floristic Quality of restoration sites, as discussed by Wilhelm and Ladd [
 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. They caution that species with inherently larger growth forms or high population densities could unduly influence abundance-weighted measures. Conversely, other authors question whether such measures de-value species that are inherently rare in plant communities [

 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] or improvement only in a small subset of habitats [
 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Other studies have found dramatic responses of abundance-weighted FQA metrics to invasive species control, burning, and deer control [
 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. More research is needed to determine the circumstances or purposes for which abundance-weighted FQA measures are more useful than non-weighted measures.
