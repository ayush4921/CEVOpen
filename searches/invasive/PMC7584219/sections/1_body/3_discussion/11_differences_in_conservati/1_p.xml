<p>The null hypotheses for the models tested were that of no predictable change over time. For most FQA measures there was strong statistical support for an increasing overall trend. However, Cover-weighted FQI models showed weak statistical justification for rejecting the null (despite what appeared to be a dramatic visual increase in this metric over time; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0241061.g004">Fig 4</xref>). We suggest that the lack of statistical support for change over time was caused by deviation to the otherwise increasing trend line in the middle of the study period. This “noise” within the long-term pattern affected the model’s fit and statistical significance and implicates an exogenous factor that outweighed the effects of time alone on the trend. That the restoration’s increasing trend line was interrupted by deer overpopulation and the management moratorium is actually an accurate representation of the ecology of the site. In other words, the weak model fit should have actually been expected, if the metric was accurately reflecting a temporarily stalled recovery due to the externally imposed disruption in ecological management. This is compared to metrics like FQI and Mean 
 <italic>C</italic> that showed a strong overall trend according to the test statistic, because their trend lines showed less dramatic mid-study perturbations during the management moratorium (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0241061.g002">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0241061.g003">3</xref>). In this way, the Cover-weighted FQI metric was quicker to respond and more sensitive to acute vegetation changes.
