 <p>Invasive species represent examples of rapid evolutionary change in a relatively short time period. 
  <italic>Lantana camara</italic>, a well known invasive plant in the tropics and sub-tropics, is a suitable model system to study the mechanisms underlying its rapid spread and evolution. In order to understand the dynamics of 
  <italic>Lantana</italic> invasion, we employed population genetics tools and found differential spread of two genetic varieties across the Indian landscape. Varieties also differ in terms of their climatic adaptation and gene flow, indicating possible local adaptation. Together, this may suggest that these varieties are divergent ecotypes at very early stages of differentiation.
