 <bold>Fig. S2.</bold> Fine-scale spatial genetic structure in 
 <italic>Lantana</italic>. Autocorrelograms showing the spatial autocorrelation coefficient ‘
 <italic>r</italic>’ as a function of environmental distance class for (a) Cluster 1 and (b) Cluster 2. 95 % CI about the null hypothesis of a random distribution and 95 % confidence error bars about ‘
 <italic>r</italic>’ as determined by bootstrapping. Upper (U) and lower (L) confidence limits of the 95 % CI about the null hypothesis of No spatial structure.
