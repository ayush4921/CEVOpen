<p>In order to conduct the partial Mantel tests, we grouped Cluster 1 (149 individuals) and Cluster 2 (53 individuals) into 32 and 19 populations, respectively (based on their spatial locations), and then calculated genetic, geographic and ED matrices likewise. Spatial autocorrelation is individual based, so genetic, spatial and environmental information were retrieved accordingly with 149 and 53 individuals for Clusters 1 and 2, respectively. In order to calculate ED, we used 10 selected bioclimatic and five environmental variables. Pairwise geographic and genetic distance matrices for Cluster 1 and 2 individuals were created using GenAlex (
