<p>In order to understand the non-random distribution of genetic clusters, we developed a distribution map based on the spatial frequencies of the genetic clusters. In doing this, we first calculated the fraction of all individuals with ancestry (from LLOD values from FLOCK output) in each genetic cluster at each sampling site, and then we used that frequency for each cluster (clusters from FLOCK) to depict cluster distributions across India.</p>
