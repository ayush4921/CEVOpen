<p>Nineteen climatic variables with spatial resolutions of 1 km
 <sup>2</sup> were downloaded from Worldclim dataset (

 <xref rid="PLU052C19" ref-type="bibr">Hijmans 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2005
 </xref>). To avoid redundancy and over-prediction, correlations among the 19 bioclimatic variables for 1200 random points from the study area were calculated to exclude the highly correlated ones (
