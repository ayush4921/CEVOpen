<p>Although 
 <italic>Lantana</italic> is widely distributed throughout India, we tried to select fairly dispersed occurrence points to cover diverse ecosystems which are present in the country. A total of 123 occurrence points were finally selected based on field surveys and available literature. We applied the maximum entropy (Maxent ver. 3.3.3k) method for the modelling study due to its robustness and wider application for presence-only data (

 </xref>). Fifty per cent of the total data was used for model development and the remaining 50 % was used for testing the accuracy. The model was developed with default parameters set in Maxent. The model performance was evaluated by the area under the receiving operator characteristics curve (AUC) which ranges from 0.5 (random prediction) to 1 (perfect prediction). The logistic output had been selected for displaying the distribution map and the contribution of each variable was documented. Spatial autocorrelation of the model result was tested by Global Moran's I (Tiefelsdorf 2000). The final display was prepared based on the minimum training presence value as obtained from the model output. The same task was performed with genetic cluster-based occurrence points to develop two separate models for each cluster. To check the niche similarity between the clusters, a niche overlap test was conducted using ENM tools (
