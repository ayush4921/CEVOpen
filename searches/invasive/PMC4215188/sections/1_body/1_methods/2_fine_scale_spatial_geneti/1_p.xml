<p>As our geographic population delimitation was somewhat arbitrary, we evaluated the fine-scale spatial genetic structure and the extent of gene flow by spatial autocorrelation analysis with GenAlEx ver. 6 (
 <xref rid="PLU052C39" ref-type="bibr">Peakall and Smouse 2006</xref>). Spatial autocorrelation does not require 
 <italic>a priori</italic> population delimitation, but rather clusters individuals into different distance classes based on their geographic proximity. Analyses were based on pairwise genetic distance measures from the highly polymorphic microsatellite markers (
 <xref rid="PLU052C54" ref-type="bibr">Smouse and Peakall 1999</xref>). This method employs a multivariate approach to simultaneously assess the spatial signal generated by multiple loci. The autocorrelation coefficient (
 <italic>r</italic>) is a proper correlation coefficient, bounded by [âˆ’1, +1]. It provides a measure of the extent of genetic similarity between pairs of individuals whose geographic separation falls within the specified distance class. We performed the calculation several times with different bin widths for distance (e.g. 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, etc.), but we present data only for 100 since all bin widths demonstrated a similar pattern.
