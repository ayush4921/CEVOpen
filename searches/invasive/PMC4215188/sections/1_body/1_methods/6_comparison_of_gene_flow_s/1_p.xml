<p>Unequal gene flow between two genetic clusters may have a significant impact on the development of local adaptation. We compared different models of gene flow to investigate probable gene flow scenarios; the models vary in terms of the direction and magnitude of gene flow as follows: (i) Cluster 1↔Cluster 2 (bidirectional), (ii) Cluster 1→Cluster 2 (unidirectional), (iii) Cluster 1←Cluster 2 (unidirectional) and (iv) no gene flow. We used Migrate-n which applies the Bayesian inference to calculate probabilities of explicit population models by implementing coalescence theory (
 <xref rid="PLU052C2" ref-type="bibr">Beerli 2009</xref>). It calculates Bayes factor (BF) or log Bayes factor (LBF) values, which represent the ratio of the marginal likelihoods of two contending hypotheses or models. It also reports the effect of two different approximations of the log marginal likelihood on LBF and, therefore, the level of support for specific population models. We considered the Bezier approximation as this provides a better estimate of the marginal likelihood than the harmonic mean estimator (

We used long chains = 1, long inc = 100, long sample = 10 000, burn-in = 10 000, replicates = YES: 5–50, random tree = YES, heating = YES with sampling at every 10th interval. We ran the program with 4, 9, 16 and 32 chains as in
