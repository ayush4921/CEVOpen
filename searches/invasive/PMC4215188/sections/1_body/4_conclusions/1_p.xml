<p>Evolutionary trajectories of organisms are complex outcomes of several confounding processes. In order to decipher the dynamics, one needs to uncover the probable interplay between them, i.e. the relative contributions of selection, drift and gene flow. The invasion of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> into India offers such a unique opportunity to unravel possible scenarios. Using molecular markers along with niche modelling, we elucidated the effect of drift, diverse niche requirements and evidence of isolation by ED or local adaptation. Niche models have predicted the potential distribution almost throughout India. The niches of the divergent genetic clusters are not very different but their geographic localization coupled with unequal gene flow may indicate the emergence of divergent ecotypes. This initial evidence is, however, preliminary, thus may be further investigated by characterizing individuals with genome-wide markers to obtain novel insights into dynamics of adaptive evolution and incipient speciation during invasion.
