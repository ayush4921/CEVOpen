<p>Spatial (environmental) autocorrelation clearly revealed fine-scale genetic structure. The autocorrelation coefficient (
 <italic>r</italic>) declined gradually with increasing distance from the origin as well as with increasing bin widths of different ED classes (e.g. 0.5â€“1.0)

 </bold>. The highest magnitude of the coefficients at smallest distance class and then gradual decay over distance clearly indicates the presence of a fine structure and also ascertains isolation by ED pattern or local adaptation. When the magnitude of the structure was compared among various levels (i.e. whole dataset and cluster-wise), it revealed the highest coefficient in Cluster 2 (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.345) at the first distance class while Cluster 1 yielded 0.243, perhaps indicating differences in the strength of selection.
