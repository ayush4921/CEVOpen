<p>The most likely number of clusters was determined using maximum likelihood implemented in FLOCK. In FLOCK, after running five times, high values of plateau lengths (
 <italic>n</italic> ≥ 6) were obtained for 
 <italic>K</italic> = 2, whereas very small plateau lengths (2 ≥ 
 <italic>n</italic> ≤ 3) were obtained for 
 <italic>K</italic> = 3, and no plateau was shown for 
 <italic>K</italic> &gt; 3. So, based on this support, i.e. high plateau length (i.e. 
 <italic>n</italic> ≥ 6), we took 
 <italic>K</italic> = 2 (hereafter Clusters 1 and 2) as the number of genetic clusters representing the variation. Many individuals were assigned entirely to a particular genetic cluster with high LLOD values [(±)9 to (±)19]. However, many had low-to-intermediate LLOD (−5 to +5) values which means that they lacked strong support for confident assignment into one group. So, it may further indicate shared ancestry of those individuals among multiple groups and they may be admixed as a result of outbreeding of multiple divergent source stocks.
