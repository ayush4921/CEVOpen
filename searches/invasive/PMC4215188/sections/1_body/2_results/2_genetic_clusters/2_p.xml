<p>Carefully looking at LLOD values in FLOCK runs, it appears that Cluster 1 is mostly compact, i.e. LLOD values do not vary much within that cluster. Contrary to that, the spread of LLOD values was (−5.74 to −19.02) greater in Cluster 2, i.e. there are two overlapping groups in Cluster 2, individuals with very high LLOD values (≤−12) and some with comparatively lower values (≥−12), which suggests that Cluster 2 is again sub-structured. Hence, we expected Cluster 2 to break into two groups when the number of clusters increased from 
 <italic>K</italic> = 2 to 
 <italic>K</italic> = 3. However, Cluster 2 almost remained intact while Cluster 1 divided into two, perhaps because the greater number of individuals in it provided high statistical support, or it may also be possible that the analysis is currently limited by the resolving power of the markers used.
