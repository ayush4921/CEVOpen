<p>The autocorrelation coefficient (
 <italic>r</italic>) varied with increasing distance as well as among distance classes with different bin widths (e.g. 25–300). While comparing among distance classes with different bin widths, the smallest distance class size (50) yielded the highest autocorrelation coefficient (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.196), and with increasing the bin widths (to 100, 200) the coefficient showed a gradual decline in magnitude (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU052F3">3</xref>). In general, the coefficient (
 <italic>r</italic>) dropped steadily with increasing distance and beyond 500–600 the correlation coefficients were mostly non-significant, perhaps because of dearth of samples in those distance class groups. The moderate value of coefficients clearly indicates the presence of a local structure at fine spatial scales. Gradual decay of the correlation coefficient over increasing distance also ascertains isolation by distance patterns.
