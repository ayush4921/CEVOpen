<p>The spatial extent of the studied range is quite large, and choice of distance class may play a role in the estimation of structure (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2003
 </xref>). Thus, despite taking one single distance class, we tested several distance classes of different bin widths (25–300, data only shown for 100) to understand the actual scale of action. We observed a clear trend of diminishing
