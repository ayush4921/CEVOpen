<p>The overall niche model has shown 
 <italic>Lantana</italic>'s country-wide distribution, especially in the plain lands, i.e. the Gangetic plains, the foothills of Himalayas, the western and eastern coasts, southern and north-east India. Similarly, the binary distribution map based on minimum training presence values has shown the potential distribution area across the country except for the western desert and the high altitude zones in the Himalayas (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU052F5">5</xref>A). The AUC of the test data was 0.869, indicating a good fitting of the modelled and current distribution records

 </bold>, and model residuals showed weak spatial autocorrelation (Moran's 
 <italic>I</italic> = 0.0752). The important variables were land cover, altitude and temperature seasonality (as per the jackknife plot for training gain, test gain and AUC). Models based on the genetic cluster data have shown slightly different distribution patterns. The Cluster 1 model (avg. train AUC = 0.965 ± 0.102, Moran's 
 <italic>I</italic> = −0.1;

 </ext-link>) shows high preference towards coastal areas, north-east India and the western Himalayan foothills (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU052F5">5</xref>B). For the Cluster 2 model (avg. train AUC = 0.924 ± 0.131, Moran's

 </ext-link>), the central and eastern Indian plains were found to be moderate-to-highly suitable (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU052F5">5</xref>C). However, distribution maps of genetic clusters show high niche similarity (
 <italic>I</italic> = 0.9701, 
 <italic>D</italic> = 0.8108) indicating a near identical distribution pattern.
