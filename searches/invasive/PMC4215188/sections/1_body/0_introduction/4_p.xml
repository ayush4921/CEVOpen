<p>Previously, in order to understand invasion history, we have identified multiple introductions followed by gene flow and admixture (
 <xref rid="PLU052C50" ref-type="bibr">Ray and Quader 2013</xref>). In this paper, we aim to address the contribution of environmental selection and geographic distance to evolutionary divergence of the invasive plant 
 <italic>Lantana</italic> in India. We have two broad objectives; first, unravelling the environmental requirements which effectively shape the spatial distribution of 
 <italic>Lantana</italic> by niche modelling; and second, to determine whether or not environment can explain genetic divergence in concert with geography. In addition, we discuss the probable recent dynamics of 
 <italic>Lantana</italic> and the long-term implications of these dynamics.
