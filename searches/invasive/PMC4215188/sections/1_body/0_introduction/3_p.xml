 <italic>Lantana camara</italic> (henceforth 
 <italic>Lantana</italic>) provides an interesting system which can be used to investigate such dynamics due to its recent history of invasion and establishment in India (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU052F1">1</xref>A and B). A native of South and Central America, the plant was brought to India in the early 19th century as an ornamental plant. It was originally planted in the Indian Botanic Garden, Kolkata, and was subsequently introduced into northern (Dehradun) and southern India (Mysore) (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2006
 </xref>). Eventually it escaped from gardens and gradually propagated and established itself across India. In the naturalized range, it often forms dense monospecific thickets or clumps (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 1998
 </xref>) and crowds out native species; perhaps thereby it invades or dominates an ecosystem (

 <italic>Lantana</italic> is attributed to its ecological tolerance and adaptability to various habitats (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2003
 </xref>). In addition to that, its rapid spread over diverse biogeographic regions in a very short time span (∼200 years) has instigated several unanswered questions on its ecology, history, dynamics and their effects on the overall success of the species.
