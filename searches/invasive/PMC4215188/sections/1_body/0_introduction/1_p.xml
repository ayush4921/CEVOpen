<p>Invasive species represent examples of rapid adaptive evolution in the contemporary time scale (

 </xref>). One of the major limiting factors of gene flow among populations is geographic proximity, and that can be examined by testing isolation by distance patterns. However, earlier studies have demonstrated that, even in the face of gene flow, selection can be pervasively dominating to cause divergence (
