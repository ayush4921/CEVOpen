<p>Phenotypic or genotypic correlations with environmental factors have long been regarded as signatures of selection (
 <xref rid="PLU052C11" ref-type="bibr">Endler 1986</xref>). However, the partial Mantel test was unable to track the effects of both environment and geography except in Cluster 1. In contrast, our previous results found isolation by distance patterns using Mantel test (
 <xref rid="PLU052C50" ref-type="bibr">Ray and Quader 2013</xref>). Distance-based methods are sometimes constrained by lack of statistical power and are not aptly able to explain the variance in response variables (
 <xref rid="PLU052C30" ref-type="bibr">Legendre and Fortin 2010</xref>). Likewise, a few studies have partially failed to find significant correlation with partial Mantel tests (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2009
 </xref>). However, spatial (environmental) autocorrelation analysis implies the presence of fine-scale genetic structure and non-random gene flow. Gene flow appears to be inhibited by ED, i.e. due to the presence of locally adapted genotypes or individuals. Selection is perhaps inhibiting migration by acting against non-locally adapted genotypes and ultimately favouring traits that would confer advantages under local environmental conditions (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2005
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="PLU052C46" ref-type="bibr">Postma and Van Noordwijk 2005</xref>). The prevalence of non-random gene flow is also evident from a comparison of different gene flow models, i.e. one-way gene flow from Cluster 1 to Cluster 2 was the most supported model with the highest BF value. Local adaptation of Cluster 2 genotypes possibly has been restricting their migration away from regions with favourable environmental conditions. This scenario is supported by the higher autocorrelation coefficient (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.345, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.006) observed for Cluster 2 than Cluster 1 (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.243, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001). Spatial localization of genetic clusters of 
 <italic>Lantana</italic> perhaps also evoked a similar notion of locally adapted individuals across certain geographic regions. Diverse environmental effects have been previously depicted in gene movement in California valley Oak (
