<p>The presence of isolation by ED pattern, the patchy distribution of genetic clusters and the non-random gene flow evoke the notion of local adaptation. However, our inference is constrained by low resolvability of a limited set of markers and a small number of samples at certain locations. In addition, niche separation of the genetic clusters that may represent divergent ecotypes is not well defined. However, our preliminary conclusions open up opportunities for future works that may consist of characterization of additional individuals with genome-wide polymorphism analysis, preferably using genome-scan or next-generation sequencing. In addition, this may also include phenotypic characterization of individuals, and a comparison between
