<p>Although the genetic clusters are moderately restricted in their spatial distributions (confinement is very distinct in Cluster 2) we did not observe any major differences in their potential distributions except in the Deccan plateau, and the central and eastern Indian highlands. These have encompassed slightly different areas with moderate niche similarity. The model based on Cluster 1 data has shown a greater contribution from land cover, soil type, temperature seasonality (Bio4) and altitude variables. In Cluster 2, precipitation (Bio16) has a major share along with Cluster 1 variables. The rapid spread of the species (both the genotypes) could be attributed to major land-use changes which have taken place in the country. It may be because of the degradation, fragmentation, and conversion of the forest lands creating favourable habitats in terms of higher light availability, moderate soil moisture, and other microenvironment parameters. Overlapping areas in the predicted niche space of the clusters are in stark contrast to our expectation. In a few other organisms, genetic clusters have demonstrated the ability to occupy unique and non-overlapping predicted niche areas (

Being native, these organisms have perhaps become locally adapted over much longer periods of time, so niche separation of the ecotypes/clusters appeared very distinct. In contrast, for an invasive species with only 200 years of demographic history in the new range, the climatic niche may be at a very early stage of differentiation.
