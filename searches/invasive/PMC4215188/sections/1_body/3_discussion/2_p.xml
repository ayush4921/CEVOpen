<p>Despite being effective model systems to examine adaptive evolution, invasive species are quite poorly studied, at least in terms of understanding the potential role of selection in their rapid spread. The patchy geographic distribution of genetic clusters of 
 <italic>Lantana</italic> left much space to ask further questions. For instance, what are the reasons behind this distribution? In addition to drift, is selection driving the divergence and causing the patchy distribution? Is there any local adaptation? We addressed some of these questions by analysing molecular marker data along with niche modelling tools, and investigated the contribution of environmental selection and genetic drift to 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> invasion in India.
