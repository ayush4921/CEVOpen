<p>Spatial autocorrelation often reveals subtle spatial structuring at a local scale which cannot be identified by summary statistics like

 <sub>ST</sub> and its analogues (
 <xref rid="PLU052C40" ref-type="bibr">Peakall 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2003
 </xref>). The scale of gene flow uncovered in this way is related to the underlying scale of pollination and dispersal (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2003
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="PLU052C20" ref-type="bibr">Holderegger 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2010
 </xref>) and is shaped by the plant's mating system, seedling establishment and mortality, barriers to gene flow, and so on (
 <xref rid="PLU052C15" ref-type="bibr">Gonzales 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2010
 </xref>). Fine-scale structure is also influenced by population history, drift and selection (
 <xref rid="PLU052C18" ref-type="bibr">Heywood 1991</xref>). Tropical tree species mostly have clumped distribution, partly due to limited seed dispersal ability (
 <xref rid="PLU052C23" ref-type="bibr">Jones 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2005
 </xref>) and demonstrate high levels of spatial structure (
 <xref rid="PLU052C15" ref-type="bibr">Gonzales 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2010
 </xref>). At the other end of the size scale, herbs may also show high levels of structure at a fine scale, again due to restricted propagule movements (
 <xref rid="PLU052C62" ref-type="bibr">Torres 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2003
 </xref>). Invasive species, on the other hand, are expected to exhibit low levels of spatial structure because of their rapid pace of recent spatial expansion. The magnitude of local structure is likely to depend on the phase of their range expansion, the geographic scale of measurement, the proximity to neighbours, and their dispersal ability.
