<p>The presence of fine-scale genetic structure implies that the gene flow is not random and is constrained by distance. The prevalence of isolation by distance inferred by spatial autocorrelation is also in agreement with earlier conclusions (
 <xref rid="PLU052C50" ref-type="bibr">Ray and Quader 2013</xref>) and is robust since there is no 
 <italic>a priori</italic> population delimitation. This suggests that populations are experiencing moderate gene flow over relatively short distances (i.e. &lt;500â€“600), and low gene flow across longer distances. So, the current pattern of distance-limited gene flow may be implicated in the development of some local adaptation and can further stimulate adaptive divergence of geographically distant populations. Rapid short-distance pollination and dispersal can be attributed to the mobility of the birds and butterflies that pollinate 
 <italic>Lantana</italic>, and the small-to-large mammals and birds that disperse the seeds (
 <xref rid="PLU052C22" ref-type="bibr">Johnson 2007</xref>). On the other hand, spread over a large spatial scale may require the formation of small satellite populations that serve as a source for secondary or tertiary spread. However, questions on long-distance gene flow of 
 <italic>Lantana</italic>, its mode and extent, still remain.
