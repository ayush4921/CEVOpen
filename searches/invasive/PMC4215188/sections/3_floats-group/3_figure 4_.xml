 <caption>
  <p>Distribution of clusters across India. Pie charts show percentage frequency of each cluster, and are proportional to the sample size at the corresponding sites. For better representation, some sites are combined with the nearest sites due to dearth of samples (less than five individuals). Clusters 1 and 2 are shown in black and grey colour, respectively.</p>
