 <caption> The infection rate of foliar fungus Colletotrichum sp. in pathogen experiment. Col+ and Col− represent seedlings with and without Colletotrichum sp., respectively (a, b). P+ and P− represent with and without D. helianthi, respectively (a). L1‐5 represent different leaf ages (b). Nonparametric Mann–Whitney U tests were used to identify the difference in fungal infection rate between leaves with and without Colletotrichum sp. The fungal infection rate was significantly different between Col+ and Col− leaves (a) (** represents p &lt; 0.01), but was not significant between different leaf ages, where the same letter means that there was no significant difference between different ages of leaves either with (uppercase letter) or without (lowercase letter) Colletotrichum sp. (b). The error bar represents the standard error </caption>
