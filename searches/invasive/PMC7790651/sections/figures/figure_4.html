 <caption> Effects of the foliar fungus Colletotrichum sp. on the growth of A. adenophora in different soil conditions. Col+ and Col− represent seedlings with and without Colletotrichum sp., respectively; AS and FS represent agricultural and forest soil, respectively; S and NS represent sterilization and nonsterilization, respectively. Nonparametric analysis was used to compare the differences in growth performance between Col+ and Col− seedlings, sterilized and nonsterilized soils and agricultural and forest soils (n.s. represents p &gt; 0.10, + represents p &lt; 0.10, * represents p &lt; 0.05, ** represents p &lt; 0.01). The error bar represents the standard error. Since one Col+ seedling died in the S‐FS treatment, statistical analysis between the Col+ and Col− seedlings was not performed for the biomass measurements (b, c) </caption>
