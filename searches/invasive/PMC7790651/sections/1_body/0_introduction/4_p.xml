<p>More interestingly, interactions of belowground and aboveground biota may exist when performing PSF studies. For example, the invasive plant 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> experienced a positive PSF, and the effect of the PSF even extended beyond the soil microbial community to affect foliar fungi, which in turn enhanced resistance to herbivory in 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> and thus accentuated the invasive properties of this species (Pattison et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). In reality, invasive hosts expand into different habitats across a large geographical scale (Vilà et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>) and potentially interact with diverse belowground biota (e.g., soilborne pathogens) and aboveground biota (e.g., foliar fungi). However, it is unclear whether the invasive host experiences distinct soil biota effects in different habitats and how the roles of the soil biota change after a foliar fungus is introduced; in addition, it is also unknown whether a foliar fungus can modify both aboveground diseases and herbivory in the invasive host.
