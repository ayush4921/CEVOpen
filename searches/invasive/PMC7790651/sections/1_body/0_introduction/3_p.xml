<p>In addition to aboveground biota, invasive plants also interact with belowground biota. Escape from soil‐specific host pathogens has been suggested to play a key role in determining the success of exotic plant invasion into local ecosystems, and this phenomenon is referred to as positive plant–soil feedback (PSF) (Callaway et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>; Hawkes et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>; Klironomos, 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>; Kulmatiski et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Nonetheless, exotic plants have not experienced uniformly positive PSF, for example, Andonian et al. (
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) indicated that an invasive weed experienced negative PSF; Crawford and Knight (
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) found that 
 <italic>Lespedeza cuneata</italic> experienced positive PSF in invaded soils only in the absence of competition; and for some plant species, a positive PSF was observed in a glasshouse but not in the field ((Schittko et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). These discrepancies suggest that the PSF experienced by the exotic invaders is context dependent and may involve the soil habitat type in which the plants grow (Pizano et al.,
