<p>Seeds were collected from wild populations of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> in Kunming city (24°58′22″ N, 102°27′49″ E, 1980 m), Yunnan Province, Southwest China. Completely filled seeds were selected and surface sterilized by submerging them in 95% ethanol for 30 s and 2% sodium hypochlorite for 20 min and rinsing them with sterile water three times. After surface sterilization, the seeds were submerged in sterile water for 24 hr and then planted in pots containing sterile soils. The soils used to grow the plants were sterilized three times at 24‐hr intervals by autoclaving (121°C, 0.135 MPa, 2 hr). Pots were disinfected by submerging them in 0.2 g/L potassium permanganate solution for 30 min. Plants were cultivated in an RXZ‐380D growth chamber (Ningbo Southeast Instrument Co., Ltd, Ningbo, China) with a temperature of 25 ± 1°C, light intensity of 80–100 µmolm
 <sup>−2</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup>, 12‐hr photoperiod and humidity of 80 ± 5%. The germinated seedlings were supplemented with the same amount of sterile water in each pot every day as needed and watered with Hoagland nutrient solution (detailed in Table 
 <xref rid="ece37072-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>) once a month. The seedlings were grown for 5 months, and then those of similar sizes (approximately 20 cm shoot length) were randomly selected for the subsequent experiments.
