<p>Nonparametric Mann–Whitney U tests were used to identify the differences in growth between inoculated and noninoculated seedlings, sterilized and nonsterilized soil and agricultural and forest soil, as well as differences in the fungal infection rate, leaf spot area and seedling feeding frequency in the wild between Col+ and Col− leaves. Linear regression was used to analyze the relationships between leaf spot area and leaf age as well as infection time.</p>
