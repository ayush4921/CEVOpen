<p>In addition, although 
 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> sp. JK99 has been isolated from healthy leaves and reported as an endophyte of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> (Mei et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), we found that healthy Col+ leaves developed a larger leaf spot area than healthy Col− leaves only through puncturing (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37072-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>), and symptoms worsened with leaf age (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37072-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>). This finding confirms that the foliar fungus 
 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> sp. is in fact a latent pathogen of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic>, as previously reported for other invasive plant species (de Macedo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Newcombe et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) and supports the viewpoint that latent pathogens induce disease symptoms when plant tissues are physically damaged (Viret &amp; Petrini, 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">1994</xref>). 
 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> has various life habits and can be broadly categorized as necrotrophic, hemibiotrophic, latent or quiescent and endophytic (De Silva et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Some endophytic fungi, such as latent pathogens and quiescent pathogens, may induce disease symptoms later when the plant tissues age or become weakened (Kogel et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Viret &amp; Petrini, 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">1994</xref>). Indeed, very recently, our group indicated that many members of 
 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> sp. were asymptomatic latent pathogens of both 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> and co‐occurring native plants (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Nonetheless, the disease symptoms elicited by 
 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> sp. were very weak, and disease development was halted within two weeks after wounding (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37072-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>).
