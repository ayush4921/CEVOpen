<p>In conclusion, our preliminary study characterized the interactions among an invasive plant, a foliar fungus and natural enemies aboveground and belowground. We found that the soil type played the most important role in the growth of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic>, and the role of the foliar fungus, 
 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> sp., varied according to the habitat but primarily adversely impacted leaf development in 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic>. The foliar fungus 
 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> sp. might be a latent pathogen, and it enhanced the pathogenicity of 
 <italic>D. helianthi</italic> on 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> leaves; this fungus also marginally reduced the signs of herbivory on seedlings from natural insect enemies in the wild. Previously, invasive hosts have been shown to benefit from the presence of foliar fungi (Aschehoug et al.,

 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>; Evans,

 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). The adverse impacts in this study may be related to the latent pathogenic effects of this foliar fungus but also reflect the fact that the ecological functions of foliar fungi are usually context dependent (Hawkes &amp; Connor, 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). In particular, our study highlights the need to consider both aboveground and belowground biota in different habitats when evaluating the effects of foliar fungi.
