<p>Many studies have verified that foliar fungi can help invasive host plants resist pathogens; for example, Currie et al. (
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>) demonstrated that fungal endophytes appeared to be antagonistic to rust fungus (
 <italic>Puccinia komarovii</italic>). In this study, we found that the foliar fungus 
 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> sp. promoted the pathogenicity of 
 <italic>D. helianthi</italic> on 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> leaves (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37072-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). Moreover, when compared with leaves without 
 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> sp. inoculation, the spot area formed by 
 <italic>D. helianthi</italic> on leaves inoculated with 
 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> sp. developed faster with increasing leaf age (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37072-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). These results suggest the existence of a synergism between these two fungi that causes them to be more virulent to 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic>. Coinfection is common in nature and usually increases the pathogenicity of pathogens to the host (Laine, 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). For example, coinfection with 
 <italic>Verticillium dahliae</italic> and 
 <italic>Colletotrichum coccodes</italic> causes more severe foliar disease symptoms and crown rot in potato (Nicola) than inoculation with either of the two pathogens separately (Tsror &amp; Hazanovsky, 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>).
