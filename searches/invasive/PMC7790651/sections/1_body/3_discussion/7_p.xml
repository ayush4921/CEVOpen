<p>Foliar fungi, as a secondary metabolite source for plants, can provide their hosts with antiherbivore defenses (Nisa et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). A recent review indicates that fungal endophytes commonly have a negative effect on insect herbivores (Gange et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Our data also showed that inoculation with 
 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> sp. marginally reduced the signs of herbivory on intact 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedlings by natural insect enemies in the wild (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37072-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The plant pathogen 
 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> sp. has previously been reported to cause extensive mortality in an insect herbivore by directly colonizing insect tissue (Graziosi &amp; Rieske, 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Similarly, the members of 
 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> have been observed to infect scale insects (Marcelino et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). However, it is not known whether 
 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> species produce defense compounds to directly kill insects. Here, it was also unclear how 
 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> sp. JK99 modifies the herbivory of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic>.
