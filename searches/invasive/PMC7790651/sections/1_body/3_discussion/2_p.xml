<p>Local soil biotic and abiotic factors ultimately determine the positive or negative effects of PSF on plants (Bennett &amp; Klironomos, 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Our report characterized the growth response of the invasive plant 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> when grown in agricultural and forest soils upon interaction with a foliar fungus. We found that the soil source played the most important role in the growth of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic>. Although the forest soil showed significantly higher levels of macronutrients, such as N, P, and K, than the agricultural soil (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37072-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>), on average, all measurements for 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> growth were lower in forest than in agricultural soil (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37072-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Because the soil, as an inoculation source, was mixed with a sterilized matrix at a volume ratio of 1:9 and watered with Hoagland nutrient solution during the growth of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> (see Methods), the effects of the macronutrients in the soils on 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> were likely lessened. These data thus reflected that the unmeasured micronutrients in the agricultural soil still contributed to the growth of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic>. For example, Zhang et al. (
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>) found that 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> tends to enrich soil selenium.
