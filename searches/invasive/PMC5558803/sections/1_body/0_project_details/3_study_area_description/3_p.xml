<p>A large part of the republic has a climate similar to that of the Atlantic-Arctic region with a cold temperate (boreal) climate (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Brattsev et al. 1997</xref>). The territory is a zone of excessive moisture, widespread marshes, and wetlands. The annual precipitation exceeds the evaporation and decreases from south to north, from 700 to 550 mm. A significant difference in the climate is observed across the length of the republic from south to north and from west to east. The duration of the winter in the south of the republic is 170–180 days and that in the north is 230–250 days. The average temperature in January (the coldest month) in the south is 15 °C whereas that in the north-east is –22 °C. Summers are short and warm; the average temperature in July (the warmest month) is approximately 10°C in the north-east and 17°C in the south. The prevailing wind directions in winter are south and south-west, and north in summer. The monthly average wind speed in the taiga zone is 3–4 m/s and that in the tundra area is 6.5 m/s.
