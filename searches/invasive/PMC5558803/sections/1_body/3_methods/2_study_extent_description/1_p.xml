A separate cluster of the data was collected from a 664 km (orthodromic) distance in the territory and suburb of Inta city, located near the Arctic Circle (

   <named-content content-type="genus">Heracleum</named-content>

 </italic>, such a sampling bias may coincide with the actual factors determining the dispersal of the plants of this species. In most cases, roadsides are the optimal habitats for this species as they are open and well-lighted with adequate moisture due to the roadside drainage systems. Moreover, the air flow creates favourable conditions for the spread of the plants.
