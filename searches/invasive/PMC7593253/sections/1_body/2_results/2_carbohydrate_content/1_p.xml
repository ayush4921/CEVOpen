<p>Introduced populations had higher concentrations of total soluble sugars, fructose [except stems], and sucrose but lower concentrations of starch and cellulose in their leaves, stems and roots than native populations (

 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Populations varied in some of these characteristics with an especially significant variation for root starch and leaf cellulose (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Some of the variables depended on the time block. In August, sugars were significantly higher, but cellulose was lower in roots and stems, while leaf sugar and starch concentrations were higher and cellulose was lower. Only leaf cellulose depended on origin Ã— time block with a larger difference between native and introduced populations in July than August (+ 55 vs. + 47 mg/g,
