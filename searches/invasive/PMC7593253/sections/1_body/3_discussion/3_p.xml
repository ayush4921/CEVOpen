<p>Although there were no significant interactions between time block and population origin, the strong effect of time block on water potential motivates the additional study of possible phenological differences between introduced and native populations in attributes such as growth vs. storage. Phenological variation in carbohydrates may also be critical for linking our results to plant strategies. Other factors could simultaneously affect multiple carbohydrates such as increased soluble sugars to provide nutrients to AMF (

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Rodríguez-Caballero et al., 2018</xref>) and lower cellulose to decrease root surface resistance to AMF infection. Of course, AMF can help plants enhance water absorption by promoting the expression of aquaporins (

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Nijjer et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Paudel et al., 2014</xref>). Higher AMF colonization in introduced 
 <italic>T. sebifera</italic> compared to native populations also had been reported by 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al. (2015a)</xref>. However, it is more difficult for them to cause these same changes in carbohydrates that we found for roots to also occur in leaves and stems.
