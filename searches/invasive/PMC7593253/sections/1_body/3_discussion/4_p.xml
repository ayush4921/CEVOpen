<p>The patterns of soluble sugars, starch, and cellulose in roots, stems, and leaves in this study indicate that there may be a general functional advantage of a higher metabolic rate, lower storage, and/or physical defense in the introduced range for 
 <italic>T. sebifera</italic>. We found similar root mass and higher leaf and stem mass (and so lower R:S) in introduced populations than in native ones (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). This indicated that relatively more photosynthetic products were allocated to the shoots for the introduced populations and relatively more mass was allocated to root growth for the native populations. A lower R: S may provide an advantage in the competition for aboveground resources (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Reynolds and Pacala, 1993</xref>) which shows a greater importance for aboveground resource acquisition and competition in the introduced range that has been found for other species (

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Petruzzellis et al., 2019</xref>). The more negative root water potential of plants from introduced populations may reflect their higher solute (soluble sugars) concentrations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) that improve the ability of root system to absorb water from the soil because of soluble sugarâ€™s osmotic regulation role (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Woodruff and Frederick, 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, 
 <italic>T. sebifera</italic> trees from introduced populations are more able to tolerate conditions of osmotic stress such as salinity (
