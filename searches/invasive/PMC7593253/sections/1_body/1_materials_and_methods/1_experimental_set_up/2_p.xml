We collected mature seeds (pods had dehisced to expose seeds) from 6 to 10 widely spaced, haphazardly selected adult trees. We pooled seeds from separate trees within each population. The introduced populations included those descended from the two historically recorded major introduction events (

The Georgia populations are descended from the original introduction in 1772, which was most likely from a Guangdong province population and the rest of the US populations are descended from a later introduction around 1900 most likely from a Jiangsu province population (
