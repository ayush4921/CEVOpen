<p>We examined AMF on the fine root samples from the other set of plants. We stored each AMF root sample in a histocassette in ethanol until we processed them following the methods of 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Nijjer et al. (2004</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2008)</xref>. We cleared and bleached the roots. Then we acidified and stained them (trypan blue), and slide-mounted 30 1-cm fragment of fine roots (PVA mount). We examined the slides (400Ã— magnification) and recorded the number of 300 grid intersection points at which mycorrhizal hyphae were present.
