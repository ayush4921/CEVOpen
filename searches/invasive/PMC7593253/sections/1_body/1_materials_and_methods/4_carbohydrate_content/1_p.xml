<p>We separately ground each plant’s roots, stem, and leaves (excluding petiole) using a ball mill (Retsch-MM400, Retsch, Haan, Germany). The tissue total soluble sugar, sucrose, and fructose concentrations as well as starch and cellulose concentrations were determined using Comin Biochemical Test Kits (Comin Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Suzhou, China) per the manufacturer’s instructions. For a complete measurement of soluble sugar and starch concentrations, the sample was extracted three times and then the supernatant was used for soluble sugar determination and the residue was used for starch measurement.</p>
