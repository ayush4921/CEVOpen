<p>Here we examined the mass and carbohydrate concentrations of roots, stems, and leaves as well as root water potential and AMF colonization in a common garden experiment with plants of Chinese tallow trees (
 <italic>Triadica sebifera</italic>) from China (native range) and USA (introduced range). Specifically, we asked the following questions: (1) How do soluble sugars, starch, and cellulose concentrations vary among leaves, stems, and roots of introduced and native populations? (2) How do their AMF colonization and root water potential differ? We predict that, relative to native populations, introduced populations have a greater allocation to soluble sugars vs. starch and cellulose, higher AMF colonization and more negative root water potentials.
