<p>Furthermore, invasive plant root growth and functioning are affected by the synthesis, allocation, and storage of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates in plant tissues are usually classified as structural or non-structural carbohydrates according to their chemical structure and function in plants (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Dietze et al., 2014</xref>). Structural carbohydrates, as non-storage components, are long-chained molecules and mainly include polymerized compounds, such as cellulose which confers mechanical strength to cells, playing important roles in maintaining or changing plant tissue density (

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Miedes et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, low cellulose concentrations in roots may reduce defense against natural enemies, but facilitate arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) penetrating into roots, increasing AMF colonization. AMF establish symbioses with most terrestrial plants, assisting plants to obtain water and nutrients from the soil by forming a large composite network of root hyphae to expand the absorption area of the host plant roots and increase the root length, and by inducing greater aquaporin expression (

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">LÃ¼ et al., 2018</xref>). Studies have shown some introduced populations of plants can have higher AMF colonization than native ones (

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2015a</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). However, it remains unknown whether cellulose concentrations differ between introduced and native populations despite the potential for this difference to play a role in invasion success.
