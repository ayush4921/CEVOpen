<p>As in many, if not all, biogeographic comparisons of populations of a species from native and non‐native ranges, it is very difficult to be certain if apples are being compared to apples. This is certainly true for goldenrod. 
 <italic>Solidago canadensis</italic> is taxonomically complex. In North America, several taxonomic subunits have been recognized within the 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> species complex, including 
 <italic>S. altissima</italic>, which is considered to be a distinct species by some (Kabuce &amp; Priede, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Weber, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0080" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). Others have argued that the primary representative of the 
 <italic>Solidago</italic> complex in Europe is closer to 
 <italic>S. altissima</italic> than 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic> (Priedītis, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>; but see Semple &amp; Cook, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0070" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). Our study cannot speak to this debate because we collected seeds from single populations in each country, which precluded tests of population variation within any range (see Rosche et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>).
