<p>Our field experiments suggested that associational effects between common tansy and goldenrod can influence patterns of enemy release. Associational effects arise when herbivore effects on a focal plant change due to the presence or identity of neighboring plants (reviewed by Barbosa et al.,

 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0075" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). In this context, insect herbivory reduced tansy biomass in the native range of Europe only when goldenrod was absent, whereas insect herbivory had no effect on tansy in the USA, regardless of the presence of goldenrod (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36737-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Said differently, in Europe only, the presence of goldenrod at least partially ameliorated the negative effects of insect herbivory on tansy biomass. Biogeographic differences in associational effects relevant to plant invasion have been hypothesized (Orrock, Holt, &amp; Baskett, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>), but to our knowledge, this is the first empirical evidence that the outcome of associational effects can depend upon whether interactions occurred in the native or non‐native range of a focal species. Importantly, our interpretation of associational effects should be viewed with some caution because at the plot level, we controlled for total plant density but not species‐specific frequency, which can influence the detection of associational effects (Underwood et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0075" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Regardless, our findings underscore a growing body of research suggesting that invasive species can impose associational effects on native neighbors for better (Atwater, Bauer, &amp; Callaway,

 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0077" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>) or for worse (Beckstead, Meyer, &amp; Ausperger,
