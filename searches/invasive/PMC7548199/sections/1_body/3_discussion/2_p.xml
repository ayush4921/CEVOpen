<p>A handful of studies have experimentally shown that natural enemies inhibit invasive plant species more in their native ranges than in their non‐native ranges (e.g., DeWalt et al.,

 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>; Williams et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0082" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>), but we examined the effects of multiple enemy guilds on more than one invasive species in both ranges. We found that enemy release from insect herbivores, but not antagonistic soil biota, and antagonistic soil biota, but not insect herbivores, may enhance the performance of tansy and goldenrod, respectively, in their non‐native ranges relative to their native ranges. These findings suggest that biogeographic escape from effects natural enemies can depend upon the enemies, the invader, and competition.
