<p>It is well understood that natural enemies can have idiosyncratic effects on the performance of invasive plant species (Agrawal et al.,

 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>), but our study is unique in experimentally examining the effects of more than one kind of natural enemy on more than one invasive species in more than one range, simultaneously We found that the effects of natural enemies depended upon the identity of the focal invader, biogeographic context, and the focal invader's biotic environment–including the presence of heterospecific neighbors. These findings enhance our nuanced perspective of how natural enemies can influence the success of invasive plant species.
