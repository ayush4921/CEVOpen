<p>Our study agrees with other reports that goldenrod can facilitate tansy. Goldenrod in Europe is generally associated with negative effects on biodiversity at the community level, but Schittko and Wurst (
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0068" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) showed that for tansy in Europe, spatial association with goldenrod can increase growth. Our field experiments expanded these findings to the USA, but there only when insects were present (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36737-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Zhang et al. (
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0084" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) suggested that goldenrod could facilitate tansy by suppressing antagonistic soil biota, but we found no evidence for this because goldenrod soils in both Hungary and the USA suppressed tansy performance (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36737-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). However, plant–soil feedbacks themselves are highly conditional (DeLong et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>), with feedbacks for the congener 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic> varying twofold to 10‐fold among sites and among source populations (Maron, Luo, Callaway, &amp; Pal, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). With respect to our field experiments, we speculate that in the USA, goldenrod facilitated tansy primarily by providing associational resistance against insect herbivory. Importantly, plant–plant facilitation can occur via a number of nonmutually exclusive mechanisms, which include associational effects (reviewed by Callaway,
