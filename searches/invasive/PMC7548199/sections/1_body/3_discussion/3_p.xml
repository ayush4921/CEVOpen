<p>Our study emphasizes the importance of testing the ERH by contrasting the effects of natural enemies in the native versus non‐native ranges of invasive species (Keane &amp; Crawley, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>; Maron &amp; Vilà, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). To date, most empirical examinations of the ERH have conducted biogeographic comparisons of 
 <italic>enemy loads</italic> and inferred enemy release when fewer enemy species attacked focal invaders in the non‐native range compared to the native range (see reviews by Meijer, Schilthuizen, Beukeboom, &amp; Smit, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Roy et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0065" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). This approach may demonstrate escape from certain natural enemies (e.g., Mitchell &amp; Power, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>), but it does not show release because reduced enemy loads may not translate to increased abundance or performance for the invader (Beckstead &amp; Parker, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). To this point, previous work has shown that goldenrod is attacked by more species of insect herbivores in the native range than the non‐native range (Jobin et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">1996</xref>; Long et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>), but our experiments found no evidence that this pattern translated to plant performance in the field–insects damaged goldenrod in both native and non‐native ranges (Appendix

 <xref rid="ece36737-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>) but failed to reduce biomass in either range (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36737-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; see also van Kleunen &amp; Schmid, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0076" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). Furthermore, herbivore damage on tansy was by far greatest in Hungary (Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece36737-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>: Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36737-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>), but plants in Hungary outgrew plants in Germany (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36737-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).
