<p>In field experiments, tansy and goldenrod both grew much larger in the non‐native range than in the native range, but this does not constitute strong support for the evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA) hypothesis (Blossey &amp; Nötzold, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">1995</xref>). Escape from natural enemies may permit translocated species to divert resources formerly required for defense toward growth and/or reproduction (Blossey &amp; Nötzold, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">1995</xref>). Over evolutionary time, this could result in a concomitant decrease in defensive characteristics and an increase in vigor (i.e., size or fecundity) for populations in the non‐native range relative to the native range (Blumental &amp; Hufbauer, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Maron, Vilà, &amp; Arnason, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>; Uesugi &amp; Kessler, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0074" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Empirical support for the EICA hypothesis is mixed, but there are many examples of invasive species performing better in the non‐native range relative to the native range (see reviews by Felker‐Quinn, Schweitzer, &amp; Bailey, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Jeschke et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Lamarque, Delzon, &amp; Lortie, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Rotter &amp; Holeski, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0064" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). In this context, tansy and goldenrod in the field both grew larger in non‐native ranges than native ranges, regardless of insect exclusion. This accords with reports that invasive populations can outperform those from the native range independently of the effects of natural enemies (Siemann, DeWalt, Zou, &amp; Rogers, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0071" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Such increased size in the non‐native range may help explain why tansy in field experiments only imposed significant competitive effects on goldenrod in the USA. For tansy, our greenhouse (i.e., common garden) experiments hinted that there may be a genetic (i.e., evolutionary) basis to biogeographic differences in plant size, but we did not control for founder effects because study plants came from single populations in each country. Thus, we cannot make strong inferences about the EICA hypothesis, despite our use of common gardens. Interestingly, we found that goldenrod in the greenhouse grew larger in the native range than the non‐native range, which is the opposite pattern predicted by the EICA hypothesis. This coincides with the report of Van Kleunen and Schmid (
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0076" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>), which found no evidence for EICA in 
 <italic>S. canadensis</italic>. However, Uesugi and Kessler (
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0074" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) found strong support for EICA in 
 <italic>S. altissima</italic>, a closely related and functionally similar (Kabuce &amp; Priede, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>) congener.
