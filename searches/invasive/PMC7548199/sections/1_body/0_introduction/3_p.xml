<p>Of the biogeographically explicit tests of the ERH, very few have excluded multiple kinds of natural enemies simultaneously or in factorial experiments (but see DeWalt et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>; Williams, Auge, &amp; Maron, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0082" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). This is an important knowledge gap because plants function in complex biotic environments where they may be attacked by different kinds of natural enemies at once, including competitors, herbivores, and pathogens (Cipollini, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>; DeLong, Fry, Veen, &amp; Kardol, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>; Fernandez‐Conradi et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Importantly, the effects of these enemies are not necessarily additive (reviewed by Stephens, Srivastava, &amp; Myers, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0073" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). For instance, DeWalt et al. (
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>) excluded fungal pathogens and insect herbivores from populations of the invasive shrub 
 <italic>Clidemia hirta</italic> in its native and non‐native ranges. In understory sites in the native range, survival of 
 <italic>C. hirta</italic> increased by 19% when treated with fungicide, 12% when treated with insecticide, and 41% when treated with both. Pesticide applications did not affect 
 <italic>C. hirta</italic> survival in the non‐native range. Taken together, these findings suggest that antagonistic fungi and insect herbivores acted singly and jointly (in a nonlinear fashion) to limit 
 <italic>C. hirta</italic> survival in the native range but not in the non‐native range, as predicted by the ERH. This example illustrates how testing the ERH on single enemy guilds in isolation limits our understanding of the effects of natural enemies on invasion trajectories, which in turn hinders our ability to explain, predict, and manage the spread of invasive species. These issues have crucial implications for the function of contemporary ecosystems (Bellard, Leroy, Thuller, Rysman, &amp; Courchamp, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Vilà et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0079" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) and economies (Pimentel, Zuniga, &amp; Morrison, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>; Seebens et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0069" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Thus, biogeographic tests of the ERH that exclude multiple guilds of natural enemies simultaneously are sorely needed, as emphasized in the review of Roy, Lawson Handley, Schonrogge, Poland, and Purse (
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0065" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>).
