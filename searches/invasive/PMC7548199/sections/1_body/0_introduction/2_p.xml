<p>The enemy release hypothesis (ERH) is a leading explanation for successful biological invasions by exotic plant species. The ERH asserts that biogeographic translocation allows some exotic plant species to leave behind their natural enemies, resulting in relative freedom from top‐down controls in non‐native communities relative to native communities (Keane &amp; Crawley, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). This idea can be tested experimentally by excluding natural enemies in the native and non‐native ranges of invaders (Maron &amp; Vilà, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). The ERH predicts that enemy exclusion should increase the performance of invaders to a greater extent in their native range (where enemies should have relatively strong top‐down effects) than in their non‐native range (where enemies should have relatively weak top‐down effects) (Keane &amp; Crawley, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>; Maron &amp; Vilà, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). The ERH has attracted considerable empirical attention (see reviews by Jeschke et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Liu &amp; Stiling, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>), but relatively few studies have employed the experimental, biogeographically explicit approach outlined above. Also, most studies have examined the ERH in the context of specialist herbivores, but enemy release from several kinds of enemies has been demonstrated, including antagonistic soil biota (Maron, Klironomos, Waller, &amp; Callaway, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Reinhart, Packer, van der Putten, &amp; Clay, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>), aboveground fungal pathogens (DeWalt, Denslow, &amp; Ickes, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>), interspecific competitors (Callaway et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>), generalist herbivores (Vermeij, Smith, Dailer, &amp; Smith, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0078" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>), and even postdispersal seed predators (Lucero et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>).
