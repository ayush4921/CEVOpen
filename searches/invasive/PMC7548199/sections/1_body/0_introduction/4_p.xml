<p>Here, we examined the effects of two important kinds of enemies–insect herbivores and antagonistic soil biota–on the performance of two invasive plant species–common tansy (
 <italic>Tanacetum vulgare</italic>; “tansy” hereafter) and Canada goldenrod (
 <italic>Solidago canadensis</italic>; “goldenrod” hereafter)–in their native and non‐native ranges. Specifically, we tested the key prediction derived from the ERH that excluding these enemies would improve the performance of tansy and goldenrod more in their respective native ranges than in their non‐native ranges. To do this, we replicated enemy exclusion experiments in Europe (where tansy is native but goldenrod is exotic and invasive) and in the USA (where goldenrod is native but tansy is exotic and invasive), using field‐based and greenhouse approaches. In Europe and the USA, tansy and goldenrod commonly co‐occur and may compete directly for limiting resources (Schittko, Runge, Strepp, Wolff, &amp; Wurst,

 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) and apparent competition (Orrock, Witter, &amp; Reichman, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Accordingly, our field experiments crossed insect exclusion treatments with interspecific competition treatments to account for the possibility that herbivory and competition interacted to influence plant performance.
