<p>We used linear mixed‐effects models to evaluate the effectiveness of insecticide applications on experimental plants in the field. Our models used herbivore damage (averaged across individuals per plot) as the response variable; biogeographic range (i.e., whether interactions took place in the target species’ native or non‐native range), country in Europe (Germany or Hungary), insecticide treatment, and competition treatment as interacting fixed factors; and experimental block as a random factor. We analyzed tansy and goldenrod with independent models. If insecticide treatments worked as expected, herbivore damage should be greatest on untreated plants, resulting in a significant main effect of insecticide for both species.</p>
