<p>We used linear models to evaluate the independent and joint effects of biogeographic range, soil biota, and soil‐mediated plant–plant interactions on performance (i.e., total biomass) in greenhouse experiments. Our models used total biomass as the response variable; and biogeographic range, sterilization treatment (sterilized vs. live soils), and soil source (soils cultured by conspecifics vs. heterospecifics) as interacting fixed factors. We analyzed tansy and goldenrod independently. If the effects of soil biota follow predictions derived from the ERH, sterilizing soils (i.e., excluding antagonistic soil biota) should increase the performance of invaders in their native range to a greater extent than in their non‐native range. Specifically, soil sterilization in Hungary should increase the performance of tansy to a greater degree than soil sterilization in the USA; and soil sterilization in the USA should increase the performance of goldenrod to a greater degree than soil sterilization in Hungary, resulting in significant sterilization × biogeographic range interactions.</p>
