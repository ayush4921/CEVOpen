<p>We used linear mixed‐effects models to evaluate the independent and joint effects of biogeographic range, insect herbivory, and competition on plant performance (i.e., aboveground biomass). Our models used aboveground biomass of individual plants as the response variable; biogeographic range, country in Europe, insecticide treatment, and competition treatment as fixed factors; and experimental plot nested in block as a random factor. Tansy and goldenrod were analyzed with independent models, and for the analysis of each species, we only used the plots of each block that contained the target species. If the effects of insect herbivores follow predictions derived from the ERH, herbivore exclusion (i.e., insecticide application) should increase the performance of focal invaders to a greater extent in the native range than in the non‐native range. Specifically, herbivore exclusion in Europe should improve the performance of tansy to a greater degree than herbivore exclusion in the USA, and herbivore exclusion in the USA should improve the performance of goldenrod to a greater degree than herbivore exclusion Europe, resulting in significant insecticide × biogeographic range interactions.</p>
