<p>Goldenrod is native to North America but was introduced to Europe in the 17th century, also for medicinal and ornamental purposes. Since its introduction to Europe, goldenrod has become one of the most abundant and problematic invasive plant species on the continent (Rebele, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). In non‐native ranges, goldenrod invasion reduces the biodiversity of native plant and animal communities (Ledger et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Lenda et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>; Skorka, Lenda, &amp; Tryjanowski, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0072" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>), alters soil biogeochemical processes (Lu, Qiu, Chen, &amp; Li, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>), and disrupts interactions with pollinators (Fenesi et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Despite these negative effects, goldenrod in Europe has reportedly facilitated the growth of tansy (Schittko &amp; Wurst, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0068" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), perhaps by suppressing antagonistic soil biota (Zhang, Jin, Tang, &amp; Chen, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0084" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). In its native range, goldenrod is a strong competitor but does not reduce community‐level biodiversity as it does in the non‐native range (Ledger et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; but see Carson &amp; Root, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). In the native range, goldenrod is attacked by a rich community of insect herbivores, which can decrease growth, fecundity and competitive ability (Cain, Carson, &amp; Root, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">1991</xref>; Carson &amp; Root, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>; Long, Mohler, &amp; Carson, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). In contrast, goldenrod is attacked by a relatively depauperate generalist insect community in the non‐native range (Jobin, Schaffner, &amp; Nentwig, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">1996</xref>), and the effects of insect herbivory on goldenrod performance in the non‐native range are unclear. In addition, as with tansy, the extent to which soil biota affects goldenrod performance in native versus non‐native ranges has received little attention.
