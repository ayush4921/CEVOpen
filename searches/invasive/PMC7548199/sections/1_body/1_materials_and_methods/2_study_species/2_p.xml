<p>Tansy is native to Europe but was introduced to North America in the 17th century for medicinal and ornamental purposes and is now broadly distributed across this non‐native range (Mitich, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">1995</xref>). In the non‐native range, some state governments have listed tansy as a noxious weed due to negative impacts on local biodiversity and pasture quality (LeCain &amp; Sheley, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). In its native range, tansy is attacked by over 169 species of herbivorous insects, including 29 specialist species, which can substantially decrease performance (Kleine &amp; Müller, 
 <xref rid="ece36737-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Little is known about the effects of insect herbivory in the non‐native range. In addition, to our knowledge, no study has contrasted the effects of soil biota on tansy performance in native versus non‐native ranges.
