<p>We replicated full‐factorial greenhouse experiments in Hungary and Montana to examine the effects of local soil biota on the performance of tansy and goldenrod in their native and non‐native ranges (see Table 
 <xref rid="ece36737-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref> for greenhouse locations and growing conditions). At the conclusion of the field experiments described above, we collected 1 L of soil from each plot that had been occupied by monocultures of either tansy or goldenrod in Hungary and the USA (
 <italic>n</italic> = 30 soil samples per species per country). Soil samples from each plot were kept separate and were not pooled. One half liter (0.5 L) of each soil sample was sterilized by autoclaving for two, 60‐min intervals with a 24‐hr rest between intervals. The other 0.5 L of each soil sample was left unsterilized so that the soil biota remained intact (i.e., “live”). We then filled 250 ml pots with either sterilized or live soil. We planted one seed per species (seeds were derived from the same sources as reported above; see Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece36737-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>: Table 
 <xref rid="ece36737-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>) into a total of 240 pots (
 <italic>n</italic> = 60 per species per soil source) in each greenhouse. After 30 days, seedlings were repotted into 500 ml pots. After 90 days in 500 ml pots, plants were harvested (15 July 2011), soil was gently washed away from roots, and total (i.e., above‐ and belowground) biomass was recorded for each plant, using the same drying and weighing protocol described above. The effects of soil biota were inferred by contrasting the total biomass of plants in sterilized versus live soils. Importantly, our sterilization treatments excluded soil mutualists and antagonists simultaneously. Thus, any effects of soil sterilization on plant performance reflected the net positive and negative effects of beneficial and antagonistic soil biota combined.
