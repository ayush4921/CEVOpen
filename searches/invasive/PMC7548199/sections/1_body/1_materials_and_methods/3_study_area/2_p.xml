<p>We examined the effects of excluding natural enemies (i.e., insect herbivores and soil biota) on the performance of tansy and goldenrod using field and greenhouse experiments replicated in Europe (the native range of tansy and the non‐native range of goldenrod) and North America (the native range of goldenrod and the non‐native range of tansy). Experiments in Europe were conducted in Germany and/or Hungary, and experiments in North America were conducted in Montana, USA. Plants used in our experiments were derived from seeds collected in 2009 by hand from wild populations in Germany, Hungary, and Montana (see Appendix
