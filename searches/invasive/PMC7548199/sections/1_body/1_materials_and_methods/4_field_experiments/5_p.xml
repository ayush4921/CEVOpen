<p>In September 2011, herbivore damage on experimental plants was assessed, the aboveground biomass of each plant was measured, and the effects of insect herbivory and plant–plant competition were calculated. We reported herbivore damage as the number of leaves on the tallest shoot of each plant with visible signs of insect damage (chewed holes or leaf mines). This measure did not account for the size of plants and was not used to detect patterns of enemy release because herbivore damage per se may not translate to effects on plant performance (biomass in this case). Rather, we evaluated herbivore damage to verify that insecticide applications worked as expected. Immediately after herbivore damage was assessed, we harvested the aboveground biomass of all plants and weighed each plant individually after drying plants at 70°C for 48 hr to constant mass. We calculated the effects of insect herbivores on plant biomass by contrasting the mean biomass of plants treated versus not treated with insecticides. We calculated the effects of interspecific competition by contrasting the mean biomass of plants grown in monocultures versus bicultures. Biomass is likely a good proxy for fitness in our system because both tansy and goldenrod rely extensively on vegetative reproduction to spread and impact local communities (Dong, Lu, Zhang, Chen, &amp; Li,
