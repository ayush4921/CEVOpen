<p>Tansy and goldenrod were transplanted into experimental gardens from plants started as seeds in the greenhouse. In April 2010, tansy and goldenrod seeds (see Table 
 <xref rid="ece36737-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> for seed sources) were sown into 200 ml pots in a 1:1 mixture of sand and potting soil and kept in a naturally lit greenhouse (see Appendix

 <xref rid="ece36737-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref> for greenhouse locations). After germination, seedlings were thinned down to one individual per pot and watered once daily. In June 2010, plants were transplanted to experimental plots in two rows of three (i.e., six plants per plot, as described above), spaced 10 cm apart. In biculture plots, plant identity alternated every other plant.
