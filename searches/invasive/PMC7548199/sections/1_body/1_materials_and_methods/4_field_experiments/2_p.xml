<p>We replicated full‐factorial field experiments in Germany, Hungary, and Montana to contrast the individual and joint effects of interspecific competition and insect herbivory on the performance of tansy and goldenrod in their native and non‐native ranges. Two sites were used in Europe to increase the scope of inference in the native range. In each country, we established one experimental garden (see Appendix

 <xref rid="ece36737-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> for locations and climatic information), which were fenced to exclude mammalian herbivores. Wild populations of tansy and goldenrod were in the vicinity (&lt;1 km) of each experimental garden. Experimental gardens in Germany and Hungary were comprised of 15 experimental blocks, each consisting of six, 50 × 50‐cm plots with a 50‐cm walking path around each block. We randomly assigned one of the following planting treatments to each plot: (a) a monoculture of common tansy (6 plants), (b) a monoculture of goldenrod (6 plants), or (c) a biculture of common tansy and goldenrod (3 + 3 plants), with each planting treatment replicated twice per block. Thus, total plant density was held constant in each plot (6 plants), and interspecific competition occurred only in the biculture plots. The experimental garden in Montana was comprised of six experimental blocks, each consisting of 15 plots that received the same randomized planting treatments listed above, with each treatment replicated five times per block. In sum, gardens in all countries consisted of 90 plots that were distributed randomly over blocks with respect to planting treatment, and the same treatments with the same number of replicates were realized in all gardens.
