<p>In each experimental garden, we randomly selected half of the plots assigned to each planting treatment to be treated with insecticide. Specifically, we treated 3 out of 6 plots per block in Germany and Hungary, and 6 or 9 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3 of each) out of 15 plots per block in Montana. Thus, 45 out of 90 plots in each garden were treated with insecticide. We used a mixture of the systemic insecticide Biscaya
 <sup>®</sup> (active ingredient 
 <italic>thiacloprid</italic>, (Z)‐3‐(6‐chloro‐3‐pyridylmethyl)‐1, 3‐thiazolidin‐2‐ylidenecyanamide) and the knock‐down insecticide Decis
 <sup>®</sup> (active ingredient 
 <italic>deltamethrin</italic>, (S)‐cyano‐3‐pehoxybenzyl(1R)‐cis‐3‐(2,2‐dibromovinyl)‐2,2‐dimethyl‐cyclo‐propanecarboxylate). Neither insecticide is selective with respect to taxa. Insecticides were diluted with water as per label instructions and were applied using a nonmotorized backpack sprayer. We applied insecticides in June and August, 2010, and in May, June, July, and August 2011. On application days, plots not selected for insecticide treatment were sprayed with an equal volume of water. We protected nontarget plants from insecticide drift by spraying only on windless days, taking great care to spray only target plants.
