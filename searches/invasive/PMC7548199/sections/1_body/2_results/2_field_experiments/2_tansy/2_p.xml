<p>Insecticide treatments reduced herbivore damage on tansy across all ranges and treatments, but more so in the native range. Herbivore damage was much greater in Hungary than any other country (Appendix

 <xref rid="ece36737-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>), but insect herbivores in all countries generally damaged more leaves on untreated plants than treated plants, regardless of interspecific competition (Appendix

 <xref rid="ece36737-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). Thus, insecticide treatments worked as expected. These findings corresponded to significant main effects of biogeographic range, insecticide treatment, and country within Europe; and significant biogeographic range × insecticide treatment and country within Europe × insecticide treatment interactions (Appendix

 <xref rid="ece36737-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>). Importantly, however, herbivore damage did not necessarily translate to effects on biomass (Table
