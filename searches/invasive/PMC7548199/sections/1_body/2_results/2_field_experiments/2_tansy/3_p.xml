<p>The effects of insect exclusion on the aboveground biomass of tansy depended upon biogeographic context and the presence of goldenrod (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36737-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Consistent with predictions derived from the ERH, insect exclusion in the absence of goldenrod increased the biomass of tansy in the native range (Hungary and Germany) by at least 10.4 g (±

 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>781</sub>=−0.23, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .822). However, we observed a different pattern in the presence of goldenrod. When goldenrod was present, insect exclusion had no effect on the biomass of tansy in any country. Thus, insect herbivores reduced tansy performance in the native range only when goldenrod was absent, but had no effects in the non‐native range. In addition, regardless of experimental treatments, tansy grew at least 63.9 g (±

 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>783</sub> = 6.39; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) larger in the USA than in either European country, and tansy in Hungary grew 32.8 g (±

 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>783</sub> = 7.29, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) larger than tansy in Germany. These trends corresponded to significant main effects of biogeographic range, insecticide treatment, and country within Europe; and significant biogeographic range × insecticide treatment and insecticide treatment × competition interactions (Table
