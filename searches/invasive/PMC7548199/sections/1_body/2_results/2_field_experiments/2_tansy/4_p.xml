<p>The effects of goldenrod on tansy biomass depended upon insecticide treatment and biogeographic range (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36737-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). When insecticides were applied, tansy achieved the same biomass in the presence and absence of goldenrod, in all countries. However, without insecticides, tansy in all countries grew larger in the presence of goldenrod than in its absence (Germany: 4.67 ±

Thus, regardless of biogeographic context, goldenrod had neutral effects on the biomass of tansy when insects were excluded, but goldenrod facilitated the biomass of tansy when insects were present. These trends corresponded to a significant main effect of competition and a significant insecticide treatment × competition interaction (Table
