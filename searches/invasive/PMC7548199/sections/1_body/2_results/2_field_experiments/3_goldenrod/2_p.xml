<p>Insecticide treatments on goldenrod generally reduced herbivore damage, and more so in the native range. As with tansy, herbivore damage was much greater in Hungary than any other country (Appendix

 <xref rid="ece36737-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>), but insect herbivores in all countries generally damaged more leaves on untreated plants than treated plants, regardless of interspecific competition (Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece36737-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>: Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36737-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). These trends corresponded to significant main effects of biogeographic range, insecticide, and country within Europe; and significant biogeographic range × insecticide treatment and country within Europe × insecticide treatment interactions (Appendix

 <xref rid="ece36737-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>). Importantly, however, herbivore damage did not translate to effects on biomass (Table
