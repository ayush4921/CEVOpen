<p>The effects of tansy on goldenrod biomass depended upon biogeographic range (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36737-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In the USA, goldenrod grew 4.4 g (±
 <italic>SE</italic>: 2.9, 6.1; 
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>759</sub> = 3.3, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .001) larger in the absence of tansy than in its presence, suggesting competition, but in the non‐native ranges of Hungary and Germany, goldenrod achieved the same biomass whether or not common tansy was present (
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>759</sub>=−0.23, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .817). This pattern was unaffected by insect exclusion. Thus, common tansy imposed competitive effects on goldenrod in the native range but not in Hungary or Germany, regardless of insect exclusion. These findings corresponded to a significant biogeographic range × competition interaction (Table
