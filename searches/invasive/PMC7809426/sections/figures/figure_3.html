 <caption> The most abundantly found plant taxa in the honey samples analysed using DNA metabarcoding are summarised as a proportion of samples through the season. Plant taxa illustrated are the most frequently found plant taxa in 2017 at a predominant and secondary level. Samples collected in April ( n = 3) and October ( n = 7) were excluded. Sample sizes: May ( n = 39), June ( n = 71), July ( n = 147), August ( n = 155), September ( n = 43). Predominant: &gt;45% of sequences returned in a sample, secondary: 15–45%, important minor: 1–15% and minor &lt;1%. The overall height of the bar indicates the total proportion of samples with that taxon. </caption>
