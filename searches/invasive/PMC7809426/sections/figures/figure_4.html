 <caption> Distribution of field beans ( Vicia faba) and oilseed rape ( Brassica napus) in the UK and their presence within honey samples ( n = 424) detected using DNA metabarcoding. The distribution of field beans ( a) and oil seed rape ( b) in 2017 from CEH Land Cover plus: Crops map is shown under honey samples with Vicia spp. ( a) and Brassica spp. ( b) present, as indicated by coloured squares. Black circles: not detected. c Vicia spp. were more likely to be detected in honey within a 2 km radius of field beans ( x 2 = 52.83, d.f. = 4, p &lt; 0.0001) and Brassica spp. within 2 km of oil seed rape ( x 2 = 50.71, d.f. = 4, p &lt; 0.0001) (Supplementary Table  1). </caption>
