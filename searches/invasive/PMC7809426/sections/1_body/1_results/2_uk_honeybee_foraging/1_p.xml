<p id="Par7">A total of 157 plant taxa were identified from the 441 honey samples, using the 
 <italic>rbcL</italic> and ITS2 barcode regions combined (
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">Supplementary Data</xref>). The total frequency of occurrence for each plant taxon was calculated as the presence of the taxon across all 2017 honey samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Of the 157 identified taxa, only 44 occurred in over 5% of the honey samples and only four taxa were identified in over 50% of samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). For the abundance of each plant taxon within a sample, the proportion of sequences returned was placed into classes. Plant taxa represented by over 45% of sequences were designated predominant for that sample; between 15 and 45% were secondary; between 1 and 15% were important minor taxa and &lt;1% of reads were classed as minor taxa (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Major taxa were defined as taxa returned at a predominant or secondary level.
