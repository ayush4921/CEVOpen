<p id="Par17">Improved grassland under agricultural management is the most widespread habitat of the UK (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and has been estimated to provide the greatest contribution to nationwide nectar resource, with 
 <italic>Trifolium repens</italic> as the dominant source of nectar
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>. However, the presence of flowering 
 <italic>Trifolium</italic> species has reduced substantially within managed grasslands, due to decreasing use of clover leys in crop rotation and the increased application of inorganic nitrogen fertilizers and herbicides
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
 </sup>. Furthermore, the clover that is present in modern grasslands may not be contributing to landscape estimates of nectar, as management that includes multiple cuts or intensive grazing can prevent flowering. Nevertheless, 
 <italic>T. repens</italic> still represents the second most foraged plant in the 2017 survey suggesting that, despite declines in land cover, honeybees are still actively seeking out white clover.
