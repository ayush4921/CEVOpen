<p id="Par23">On a landscape scale, the management recommendation that has the greatest potential to increase the quantity of nectar on a UK-wide basis is to increase the presence and diversity of nectar-rich species within improved grasslands, including flowering clover (
 <italic>Trifolium repens</italic> and 
 <italic>T. pratense</italic>). Improved grasslands represent the most extensive habitat type of the UK and changes to increase plant diversity and flower availability within this habitat will have the greatest impact on nectar and pollen provision.
