<p id="Par18">White clover (
 <italic>Trifolium repens</italic>) and bramble (
 <italic>Rubus fruticosus</italic>) have similar flowering periods and the increased predominance of 
 <italic>Rubus</italic> spp. within the honey may reflect the reduced availability of 
 <italic>Trifolium repens</italic> during the same flowering period. Records show that 
 <italic>R. fruticosus</italic> increased in local frequency between 1978 and 2007, however its distribution across the UK was not found to have changed between 1962 and 2001

 </sup>. 
 <italic>R. fruticosus</italic> and 
 <italic>T. repens</italic> both offer pollen and nectar, however, the protein content and proportion of essential amino acids is lower in 
 <italic>R. fruticosus</italic> compared to 
 <italic>T. repens</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup> meaning honeybees may not be gaining the same nutritional benefits if substituting 
 <italic>T. repens</italic> with 
 <italic>R. fruticosus</italic>.
