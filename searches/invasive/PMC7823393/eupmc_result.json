    "Adaptation measures are necessary to ensure the stability and performance of the food supply relative to anthropogenic climate change. Although a wide range of measures have been proposed (e.g., planting dates, crop choices, drought resistance), there may be a ubiquitous means to increase productivity relatively quickly. Numerous studies have shown that the projected increase in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> can stimulate crop growth and seed yield with noted intra-specific differences within crop cultivars, suggesting potential differences to CO<sub>2</sub> that could be exploited to enhance seed yield in the future. However, it is worth emphasizing that atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> has already risen substantially (â‰ˆ27% since 1970) and that, at present, no active effort by breeders has been made to select for the CO<sub>2</sub> increase that has already occurred. In contrast, for weedy or crop wild relatives (CWR), there are indications of evolutionary adaptation to these recent increases. While additional steps are needed, the identification and introgression of these CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive traits into modern crop cultivars may be a simple and direct means to increase crop growth and seed yield."
