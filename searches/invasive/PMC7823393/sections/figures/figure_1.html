 <caption> Response of six red rice (RR, filled circles) and six cultivated rice (CR, open circles) varieties to the recent change in atmospheric CO 2 concentrations (300â€“400 ppm) for leaf area as a function of total above-ground biomass 55 days after sowing. Note the increase in growth for RR for the recent CO 2 increase. Data are adapted from Ziska and McClung [ 31]. </caption>
