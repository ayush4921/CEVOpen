<p>Conversely, it is generally recognized that advances in plant breeding are associated with recurrent selection, usually in field environments. As a consequence, selection for say, pest resistance, should be occurring concurrently with rising CO
 <sub>2</sub>, and, as a result, reflect CO
 <sub>2</sub> adaptation. However, plant breeding is a long-term process that can extend over decades, and indirect selection for yield under field conditions is likely to be inefficient because yield is related to a number of abiotic and biotic factors. The unintended consequences of recurring selection are that genetic variation and associated phenotypes can be reduced relative to the available hereditary potential.
