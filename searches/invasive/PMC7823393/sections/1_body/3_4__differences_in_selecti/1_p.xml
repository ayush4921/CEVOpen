<p>Additional data to confirm and expand upon these results is obviously needed. However, it is important to recognize differences within the selection process for cultivated and CWR biotypes. Weeds and wild crop relatives have been subject to natural environmental perturbations for millennia and have as a consequence maintained a much higher level of genetic diversity [
