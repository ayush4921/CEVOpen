<p>Overall, opportunities for increasing production may be missed if we assume that current breeding efforts have resulted in crop plants that are adapted to the recent increase in CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration. Rather, it suggests that CWR and natural selection may serve as a starting point for active intervention to enhance genetic diversity to meet new environmental uncertainty and optimize crop yields to ongoing CO
 <sub>2</sub> increases. In addition, land races, populations of a cultivated plant that are distinct to a given geographic and environmental locale, are worth additional evaluation and may also provide a useful genetic resource in that regard.
