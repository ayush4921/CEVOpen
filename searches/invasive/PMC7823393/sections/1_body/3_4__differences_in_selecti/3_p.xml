<p>Genetic exchange among breeders has also shifted over time. As documented by Atlin [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-10-00088" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], prior to the 1990s, breeders typically exchanged varieties. However, as Genetically modified organism (GMO) lines were introduced and breeding became more commercialized, Intellectual Property (IP) protection increased, resulting in the current U.S. practice of issuing utility patents that prevent proprietary lines from being used as parents by other breeders. Unfortunately, simultaneous with these changes, a number of countries recognized that their own indigenous crops were unique genetic resources and restricted their usage in public breeding programs. Consequently, obtaining elite or novel varieties internationally has become restrictive. Overall, such actions have reduced reliance on publically available seed sources, reducing genetic diversity [
