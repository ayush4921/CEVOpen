<p>At present, evaluations of CWR to both recent increases in CO
 <sub>2</sub> and temperature are unavailable; however, it is of interest to note one seminal study that has examined Indica, Indica-like, Japonica, and CWR of rice to projected CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentrations four temperature treatments [
 <xref rid="B57-plants-10-00088" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. They reported an increased yield sensitivity to high temperature stress at higher (600 ppm) CO
 <sub>2</sub>, but their results also showed that CWR for rice demonstrated superior CO
 <sub>2</sub> x temperature interactions with respect to yield, supporting the idea of using wild or unadapted gene pools in rice to enhance breeding efforts for climate change adaptation.
