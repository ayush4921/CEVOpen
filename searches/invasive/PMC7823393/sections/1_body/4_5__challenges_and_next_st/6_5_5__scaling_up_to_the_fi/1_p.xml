<p>Genomic and molecular traits that are assimilated into new cultivars may increase performance at the whole plant or leaf level; however, as emphasized by Sinclair et al. [
 <xref rid="B63-plants-10-00088" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], such improvements need to scale up to field responses. As such, the identification of CO
 <sub>2</sub>-induced increases in the photosynthetic rate or seed yield of single leaves or whole plants in the laboratory require complementary management approaches that will illicit similar responses in the field. In this regard, it may be worthwhile to examine historical trends by cultivar. For example, comparisons of yield performance from 1950s cultivars, relative to the same cultivars under todayâ€™s CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration using similar metrics (row spacing, soil types, pesticide usage) could help identify cultivar x CO
 <sub>2</sub> sensitivity and, potentially, elucidate management practices that could maximize CO
 <sub>2</sub> yield responses in situ.
