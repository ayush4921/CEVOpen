<p>Greater effort is necessary to document and determine those traits that may have already contributed to a greater sensitivity to recent CO
 <sub>2</sub> increases (e.g., red rice). A consensus is needed to identify those phenological, morphological, and/or physiological characteristics that are associated with CO
 <sub>2</sub> responsiveness. Initial studies have suggested different organismal levels associated with CO
 <sub>2</sub> sensitivity including genetic (e.g., carbohydrate regulation of RNA, [

 <sub>2</sub> responsiveness and crop yield for CWRs have not been identified. A definitive set of these parameters is necessary for breeders to select CO
