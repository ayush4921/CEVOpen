<p>To overcome difficulties in facilitating gene introgression, Prohens et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-plants-10-00088" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] have suggested a novel approach, ‘introgressiomics’, a mass-scale expansion of plant materials and populations that confer genetic introgressions from CWRs into crops. Their goal is to generate chromosome substitution lines (CSLs), introgression lines (ILs), and multi-parent advanced inter-cross (MAGIC) populations through the use of marker-assisted selection as a means to characterize genetic traits present in CWRs, but to also develop genetically relevant elite materials that can be incorporated into breeding programs as a means to adapt crops to climatic change.
