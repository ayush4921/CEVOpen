<p>For projected CO
 <sub>2</sub> increases, there is considerable evidence indicating that stimulatory effects of increased CO
 <sub>2</sub> may be accompanied by declines in nutritional quality, including but not limited to protein and minerals [

 <sub>2</sub>-induced changes in crop quality are still being elucidated, in part because there are a number of biological and physical processes that are influenced by increasing CO
 <sub>2</sub> [

 <sub>2</sub> increases must include concurrent selection efforts or the co-development of suitable management practices that will maintain the desired quality and nutritional characteristics necessary for human health.
