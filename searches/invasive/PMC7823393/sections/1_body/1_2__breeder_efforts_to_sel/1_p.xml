<p>While intra-specific variation in response to future CO
 <sub>2</sub> is being evidenced experimentally, there is no verification of any directed attempts by breeders to select for seed yield sensitivity to the increase in CO
 <sub>2</sub> that has already occurred. It has been proposed that rapid-cycle breeding and new cultivar introductions could, over time, incrementally improve crop lines in adapting to new climates [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-10-00088" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. If true, then breeders could be already selecting (albeit passively) the most CO
 <sub>2</sub>-responsive cultivars over time. As such, there would be little need to initiate any active CO
 <sub>2</sub> breeding programs to exploit recent (or projected) changes in CO
 <sub>2</sub> with respect to seed yield.
