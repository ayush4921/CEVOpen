<p>Interestingly, for the oat study [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-10-00088" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], significant age Ã— CO
 <sub>2</sub> interactions were observed with greater phenotypic variation noted for the older cultivars (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00088-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Diminished variance and increasing genetic uniformity is not unexpected, given increased farm size and greater mechanization during the 20th century [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-10-00088" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, uniformity can also limit responses to environmental factors, including rising CO
 <sub>2</sub> [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-10-00088" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], suggesting that the ability to respond to rising CO
 <sub>2</sub> or other environmental perturbations may be constrained through modern breeding efforts. Overall, the narrow genetic base of modern cultivars may constitute a major bottleneck for crop improvement efforts [
