<p>There are a number of studies that have explicitly tested this question. Sakai et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-10-00088" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] examined five japonica rice lines: ‘Aikoku’ (released in 1882), ‘Norin 8ʹ (1934), ‘Koshihikari’ (1956), ‘Akihikari’ (1976), and ‘Akidawara’ (2009). No differences in seed yield were noted between the oldest line (Aikoku, 1882) and the newest line (Akidawara, 2009) to increased CO
 <sub>2</sub> (19 and 19.3%, increase at 600 ppm CO
 <sub>2</sub>, relative to ambient, respectively). For wheat, yield responses to rising CO
 <sub>2</sub> actually declined with the release of newer cultivars [

 <xref rid="B15-plants-10-00088" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For oat, Ziska and Blumenthal [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-10-00088" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] examined the growth and vegetative characteristics of cultivated oat (
 <italic>Avena sativa</italic> L.) from seven geographical locations to CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration increases that corresponded roughly to the CO
 <sub>2</sub> from the 1920s (300 ppm), as well as current (400 ppm) and mid-21st century projected levels (500 ppm). Newer lines were less responsive than older lines to rising CO
 <sub>2</sub> in terms of both leaf area and tiller number. Overall, there is little evidence that cultivars in current use are those best adapted to maximize productivity in response to increasing atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> (but see [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-10-00088" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] for barley).
