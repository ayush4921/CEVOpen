<p>At present, there is no empirical evidence that breeders are selecting for CO
 <sub>2</sub> responsiveness. This may be due, in part, to current economic and agronomic practices associated with modern agriculture. Yet, it seems surprising that CO
 <sub>2</sub> as a potential adaptation strategy to maintain global food production is not being utilized. One can ask if other abiotic resources such as sunlight, water, or nutrients had increased to a similar extent in recent decades whether incentives to optimize that increase would be underway.
