<p>Among adaptation efforts, there is an opportunity to exploit the recent increase in atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> as a means to stimulate plant growth and yield. Currently, comparisons of cultivated and CWR indicate differential selection in regard to this change, with initial evidence suggesting evolutionary adaptation for some CWR, e.g., red rice. Introgression of these traits into current cultivars, and appropriate management practices, may provide a means to utilize the increase in CO
 <sub>2</sub> that has already occurred (â‰ˆ27% increase since 1970) to stimulate seed yield.
