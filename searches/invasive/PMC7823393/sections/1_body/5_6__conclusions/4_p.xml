<p>Adaptation to recent CO
 <sub>2</sub> increases will not be a complete solution to the complications associated with climate change. However, adaptation may represent one of the simplest research strategies to help maintain global food security relative to the anthropogenic stresses associated with climatic change. As such, it is hoped that this review can serve as a sounding board and starting point for additional efforts.
