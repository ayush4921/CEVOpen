<p>The challenge of adapting to an uncertain climate is paramount to maintaining global food security. High yielding crop varieties with tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses associated with climatic change are needed to meet this challenge. Currently, there is recognition that the current genetic base of modern cultivars may be too narrow for crop improvement efforts in that regard. In turn, this may reflect a lack of genetic ideotypes that encompass traits associated with climatic change or uncertainty associated with the rate of change. As such, the use of CWR (or landraces) may be a means of enhancing genetic diversity of cultivated crops as a means to adapt to these changes.</p>
