<p>On the other hand, atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> has already increased substantially from ≈325 to 412 ppm since 1970, which is an increase of ≈27%. Has this recent increase been exploited through ongoing artificial selection to choose current crop lines that are CO
 <sub>2</sub> sensitive? Has the increase in CO
 <sub>2</sub> been sufficient to begin evolutionary selection for increased growth and seed yield for weedy or crop wild relatives (CWR)? The objective of the current review is to compare and contrast selection efforts from breeders and nature with respect to CO
 <sub>2</sub> sensitivity and potential seed yield for these two groups and to provide insight into metrics that could be of immediate (and future) benefit for utilizing CO
 <sub>2</sub> to increase crop growth and seed yield.
