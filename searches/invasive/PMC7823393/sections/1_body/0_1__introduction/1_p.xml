<p>Maintaining food security is a seminal objective for the remainder of the century. While there are a number of recognized obstacles to achieve this objective, environmental limitations associated with unprecedented anthropogenic change threaten core aspects, including production, access, and quality. Specifically, climate change can alter abiotic environments, such as water availability (too much or too little), irregular temperatures, and extreme climatic events (flash droughts, derechos, etc.) [
