<p>There is another genetic approach that is becoming recognized as a potential adaptation tool: the selection of intra-specific variation in seed yield among C
 <sub>3</sub> crop cultivars in response to projected increases in atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Such an approach is being used to determine CO
 <sub>2</sub> sensitivity in conjunction with economic yield for cassava [

 <xref rid="B9-plants-10-00088" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], soybean [
 <xref rid="B10-plants-10-00088" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], wheat [
 <xref rid="B11-plants-10-00088" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], inter alia. At present, there is ample evidence that considerable variation exists within crop cultivars for anticipated increases in CO
 <sub>2</sub> and that selection for such variation holds promise as an adaptive means to increase crop yields.
