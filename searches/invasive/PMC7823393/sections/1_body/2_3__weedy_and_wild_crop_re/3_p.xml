<p>At present, there is initial evidence indicating that recent increases in CO
 <sub>2</sub> may have already altered the adaptive response of some annual weeds. For example, Bunce [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-10-00088" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] examined recent increases in CO
 <sub>2</sub> on the growth response of four annual weeds over a narrow CO
 <sub>2</sub> range (90 ppm below and above ambient) and demonstrated that the efficiency by which these weeds utilized CO
 <sub>2</sub> declined at concentrations above ambient, indicating that these weeds had adapted to recent CO
 <sub>2</sub> increases.
