<p>With respect to CWR, comparisons of relative fitness to cultivated lines suggest differential adaptation to recent CO
 <sub>2</sub> increases. Comparisons of six cultivated and six wild or weedy biotypes of rice indicated a greater overall growth response among wild relative to cultivated rice to recent (300â€“400 ppm) increases in CO
 <sub>2</sub> [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00088-f001">Figure 1</xref>), suggesting that the rapid evolution of weedy biotypes may have increased their fitness relative to the crop. Greater seed yields were also recorded for Stuttgart, a CWR to rice, compared to Clearfield, a cultivated rice line, for the same recent CO
 <sub>2</sub> increase [

 <xref rid="B33-plants-10-00088" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], seeds of two temporally distinct populations of CWR wild oat (
 <italic>Avena fatua</italic> L.) from the same location, one from the 1960s and one from 2014, (a relative CO
 <sub>2</sub> increase of 80 ppm, or 25% from 1960) demonstrated different competitive abilities against a cultivated oat (
 <italic>A. sativa</italic>) line, with the more recent (2014) 
 <italic>A. fatua</italic> population having greater growth and competitive ability at current CO
 <sub>2</sub> levels [
