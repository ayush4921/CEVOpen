<p>Crop wild relatives (CWR) are those undomesticated “cousins” of cultivated crop lines that represent a potential untapped genetic resource that could be used as a means to adapt to new pests or abiotic changes, including, at least theoretically, increased levels of CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Of course, there are no directed efforts to adapt CWR to the recent increase in CO
 <sub>2</sub>; however, it is worth determining if any evolutionary adaptive changes that have allowed CWRs to adapt to recent CO
 <sub>2</sub> increases have occurred.
