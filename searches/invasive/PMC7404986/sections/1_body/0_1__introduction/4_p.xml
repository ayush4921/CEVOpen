<p>In addition to its deleterious impacts on crop health, parthenium weed can also be detrimental to animal and human health [
 <xref rid="B20-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Although animals do not preferentially ingest the plant due to its low palatability, plant parts consumed by livestock when mixed with fodder or during grazing are toxic [
 <xref rid="B2-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Parthenium weed has been associated with contact dermatitis, photosensitisation, asthma, loss of appetite, and indigestion in several animal species, including cattle (
