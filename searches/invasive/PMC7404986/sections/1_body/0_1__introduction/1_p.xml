<p>Invasive alien plant species are a global threat to biodiversity, ecosystem function and agricultural productivity [
 <xref rid="B1-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Parthenium weed (
 <italic>Parthenium hysterophorus</italic> L.) is a highly invasive plant that has invaded 50 countries in Africa, Asia, and Oceania, where it infests forests, grazing lands, crop production systems and urban landscapes [
 <xref rid="B1-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is listed among the world’s most important invasive weeds due to its impacts on the natural and agricultural environment, including the loss of yield and quality in agronomic crops, loss of pasture and livestock productivity, land devaluation, and as the causal agent of serious health problems in mammalian systems [
 <xref rid="B1-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In Australia, parthenium weed is a ‘Weed of National Significance’ due to its negative impact on grazing lands and the livestock industry [
 <xref rid="B2-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It has been estimated to generate losses of AUD 16.8 million to the Queensland beef industry in the 1970s [
 <xref rid="B4-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], with annual productivity losses predicted to be over $110 million by 2050 [
 <xref rid="B2-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These losses were associated with the suppression of pasture growth and quality due to parthenium weed infestation, along with both direct and indirect effects on animal health [

 <xref rid="B4-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Similar negative impacts have been reported from numerous countries in its invasive range [
