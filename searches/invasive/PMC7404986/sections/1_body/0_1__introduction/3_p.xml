<p>The phytochemistry of parthenium weed has also been investigated, with a diverse set of metabolites identified in its leaves, shoots, roots and inflorescences [
 <xref rid="B1-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Several secondary metabolites have been associated with stress tolerance [
 <xref rid="B12-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] or allelopathic activity [
 <xref rid="B10-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. One of the most abundant and well characterised bioactive metabolites is the sesquiterpene lactone parthenin. Several studies have attributed the phytotoxicity of parthenium to the presence of parthenin [
 <xref rid="B8-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]; however, other reports have suggested that parthenin is only partially responsible for its phytotoxicity [
 <xref rid="B13-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Several sesquiterpene lactones and phenolics isolated from parthenium weed have been associated with phytotoxicity [
 <xref rid="B8-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Flavonoids and alkaloids have also been reported as allelochemicals produced by parthenium weed [
 <xref rid="B19-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], but most have been suggested to be minor contributors to its overall phytotoxicity.
