<p>The two Australian biotypes of parthenium weed provide a logical framework for comparative analysis and thus, the present study was carried out (1) to determine the toxic effects of plant extracts of both biotypes against animal tissues and seed germination and elongation, (2) to determine the role of the major secondary metabolites of parthenium weed on the bioactivity (phytotoxicity, photocytotoxicity and cytotoxicity) of its crude extracts, and (3) to identify other potentially bioactive compounds of interest through non-targeted metabolomics. It was hypothesised that (1) the invasive biotype of parthenium weed, Clermont, may be more phytotoxic compared to the non-invasive biotype, Toogoolawah, and this might be a contributing factor for the invasion success of the former, and (2) sesquiterpene lactones such as parthenin might be the major secondary metabolites responsible for parthenium weed toxicity to animals and plants. The results of this study will thus significantly improve our understanding of the mechanism(s) associated with parthenium weed invasion, its secondary chemistry, potential for interference with crop and pasture production and its impact on mammalian health.</p>
