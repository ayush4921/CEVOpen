<p>Parthenium weed is also noted to be allelopathic and is associated with successful plant invasion through the production of novel chemical weapons [
 <xref rid="B3-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. There are numerous reports on the phytotoxic or allelopathic potential of the species, but many provide an exaggerated account of this important ecological attribute. Nevertheless, a significant number of studies have evaluated the phytotoxic potential of parthenium weed with precision. Parthenium weed has been reported to suppress the germination and early growth of many crops, pasture and weed species [

Parthenium weed has also been reported to release allelochemicals directly as root exudates in the rhizosphere, or by the leaching of fresh or decomposing residues, the washing of leaves by rain, or as volatiles released over time from aerial plant portions [
