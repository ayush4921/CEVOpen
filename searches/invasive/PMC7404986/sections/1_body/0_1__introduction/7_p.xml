<p>Clearly, significant efforts have been made in the past to study the secondary chemistry of parthenium weed in relation to its toxic potential. However, the lack of appropriate analytics has hindered progress in correlating its presence with observed toxicity due to infestation. In recent years, advanced metabolomics techniques to assess the chemical composition of plants in relation to their bioactive constituents have gained popularity as strong and reliable tools [

For example, liquid chromatography (LC) or ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) have been successfully used for the targeted and non-targeted profiling of bioactive metabolites of invasive plant species such as
