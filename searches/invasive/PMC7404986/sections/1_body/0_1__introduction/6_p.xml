<p>Previous studies have shown that the Clermont biotype has higher germinability in collected seed lots, a more vigorous growth habit, more efficient resource acquisition capacity and superior adaptive ability when compared to the Toogoolawah biotype [

 <xref rid="B24-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, recent studies have suggested that no significant genetic diversity is present in the two contrasting biotypes [

 <xref rid="B6-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] compared both biotypes for the phytotoxic potential of their leaf litter and found no significant differences in the allelopathic activity. Parthenium weed was ranked as a moderately allelopathic species when compared to some well-known highly allelopathic plant species [
