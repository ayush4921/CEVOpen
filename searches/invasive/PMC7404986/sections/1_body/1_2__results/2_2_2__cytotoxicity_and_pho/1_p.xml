<p>The viability of the NIH3T3 fibroblasts was negatively and rapidly impacted by the increasing concentrations of leaf extracts in a dose-dependent manner (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-12-00447-f005">Figure 5</xref>). In contrast, the shoot and root extracts had no significant impact on cell viability, with root extracts at the lowest concentration (0.0625 mg mL
