<p>The photocytotoxic assessment of the leaf extracts ranging from 0.06 to 0.5 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> was insufficient to deduce a linear relationship between the extract concentration and cell viability. Hence the experiment was repeated with a broader range of extract concentrations ranging from 0.008 to 0.25 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. A strong linear relationship was observed between the extract concentration and the reduction of cell viability, with or without exposure to UV-A radiation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-12-00447-f007">Figure 7</xref>). The leaf extracts of both biotypes of parthenium weed did not differ significantly (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-toxins-12-00447">Table S4</xref>) in their cytotoxicity, with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.11 and 0.13 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> for the Clermont and Toogoolawah biotypes, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-12-00447-f007">Figure 7</xref>a). The viability of the fibroblasts further decreased following the exposure to UV-A radiation; however, the two biotypes again did not differ significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.107; 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-toxins-12-00447">Table S4</xref>), with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values being reduced to 0.037 and 0.043 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> for the Clermont and Toogoolawah biotypes, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-12-00447-f007">Figure 7</xref>b).
