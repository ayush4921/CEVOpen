<p>The crude shoot and root extracts of parthenium weed caused no significant inhibition of garden cress seed germination, radicle elongation and hypocotyl elongation at moderate dosages in comparison to the methanol control (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-toxins-12-00447">Table S2</xref>). Clermont leaf extracts were 19 and 9% more inhibitory to garden cress germination and hypocotyl elongation, respectively, as compared to Toogoolawah leaf extracts. However, the leaf extracts of the two biotypes did not differ in their toxicity to annual ryegrass (
