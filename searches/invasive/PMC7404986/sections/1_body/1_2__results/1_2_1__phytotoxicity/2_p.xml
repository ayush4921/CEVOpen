 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-12-00447-f003">Figure 3</xref>), were noted in both garden cress and annual ryegrass treated with leaf extracts of both biotypes. However, the dose–response curves revealed that the Clermont leaf extracts had lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> (concentration required to inhibit 50 response compared to positive control ) values for germination as well as the radicle and hypocotyl elongation of garden cress and annual ryegrass, as compared to those of Toogoolawah (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-12-00447-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Overall, the highest concentration of leaf extract studied (2 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) provided the greatest inhibition of garden cress germination (96%), radicle elongation (99%) and hypocotyl elongation (100%) when compared to the methanol control. Similarly, the leaf extract at this concentration also resulted in the significant inhibition of annual ryegrass germination (72%), radicle elongation (86%) and hypocotyl elongation (93%) as compared to the methanol control. The interactions between the biotype and the extract concentration for all these parameters were non-significant for all the plant tissue types (
