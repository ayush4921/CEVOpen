<p>Parthenin treatment also resulted in the significant inhibition of garden cress seed germination as well as radicle and hypocotyl elongation when compared to the methanol control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-12-00447-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Garden cress seed germination was somewhat affected by parthenin, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 532 μM, whereas hypocotyl and radicle elongation were most impacted with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 458 and 361 μM of parthenin, respectively (
