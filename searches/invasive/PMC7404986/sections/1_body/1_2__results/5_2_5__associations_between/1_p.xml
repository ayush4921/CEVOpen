<p>Simple correlations between the abundance of known metabolites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-12-00447-f012">Figure 12</xref>) and phytotoxicity (inhibition of germination, radicle elongation and hypocotyl elongation of garden cress) ranged from 0.20 to 0.70, but only two identified metabolites were significantly and positively correlated with phytotoxicity (
 <xref rid="toxins-12-00447-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Stepwise linear regression found ambrosin to be positively correlated with the inhibition of germination (R

 <italic>p</italic> = 0.012) and chlorogenic acid to be positively correlated with the inhibition of radicle elongation (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.40, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.041). Other sesquiterpene lactones previously reported in the literature (parthenin, coronopolin and damsin) were not found to be associated with phytotoxicity. In the assessment of animal cells, parthenin was significantly correlated with the observed cytotoxicity in murine fibroblasts in the dark (no UV-A) (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.79, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) but not in the presence of UV-A radiation, suggesting its potential lability under high light conditions.
