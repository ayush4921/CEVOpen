<p>A non-targeted analysis was conducted to take a more expansive look at the relative contributions of all the chemical constituents in the leaf extracts from each biotype of parthenium weed to the bioactivity assessed in the laboratory assays performed, using stepwise linear regression. The dependent variable was the bioactivity measure (inhibition of germination, inhibition of radicle elongation, inhibition of hypocotyl elongation or cytotoxicity) and the independent variables included the molecular entities extracted by molecular feature extraction from the chromatograms of individual samples via Profinder. A total of 1275 entities were detected and allowed to enter or leave the model. Although the regression analysis identified three metabolites that accounted for up to 90% of the variation in each bioassay (
 <xref rid="toxins-12-00447-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), the metabolites of importance varied for each of the bioassays. The identities of several of these metabolites could not initially be determined and did not match the retention time and accurate mass of standards, or the other metabolites previously described in the literature. Numerous metabolites appeared to be related derivatives of carboxylic acids, but further investigation will be required for positive identification.
