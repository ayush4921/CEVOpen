<p>A separate analysis was conducted for photocytotoxicity using the leaf extracts of each of the two biotypes. These samples were processed separately with Profinder before conducting stepwise linear regression; a total of 1547 molecular entities were allowed to enter or leave the model. A single component (Compound 1242) accounted for 84% of the variation in photocytotoxicity, and the addition of an additional component (Compound 1075) brought this figure to 99% (
