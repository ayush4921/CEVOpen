<p>Only four of the previously reported sesquiterpene lactones of importance (parthenin, coronopolin, ambrosin, damsin) and one phenolic acid (chlorogenic acid) were positively detected in abundance in the leaf, shoot and the root tissue extracts of parthenium weed. Parthenin was the most abundant of all metabolites detected and varied significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) by tissue type (leaf, shoot and root) but not between the biotypes (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-toxins-12-00447">Table S5</xref>). The relative abundance of coronopolin, ambrosin and damsin also differed significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) by tissue; however, chlorogenic acid was equally abundant (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.575) across all tissues (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-toxins-12-00447">Table S5</xref>). Parthenin was by far the most abundant of the sesquiterpene lactones, followed by coronopilin, ambrosin and damsin, respectively (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-12-00447-f009">Figure 9</xref>). Parthenin was present in the highest quantity in the leaf tissues (352 µg g
 <sup>−1</sup> of fresh weight) followed by the shoot and root tissues (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-12-00447-f008">Figure 8</xref>). The relative abundance of the other sesquiterpene lactones followed a similar pattern (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-12-00447-f009">Figure 9</xref>). However, the quantity of parthenin and the relative abundance of other metabolites clearly did not differ between the Clermont and Toogoolawah biotypes (
