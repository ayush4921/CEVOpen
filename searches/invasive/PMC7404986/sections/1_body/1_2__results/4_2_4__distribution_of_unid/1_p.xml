<p>Many molecular entities (including individual compounds and their fragments or derivatives) were detected in the extracts of various plant tissues of parthenium weed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-12-00447-f010">Figure 10</xref>). No single entity was exclusive to either biotype, therefore the data for both biotypes were pooled to evaluate only the tissue types. The total number of entities differed in each tissue type (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-12-00447-f010">Figure 10</xref>). Although most entities were present in all three tissue types (1471), some entities were exclusively present in only one or two. For instance, eight, five and 35 compounds were exclusively present in the leaf, shoot and root extracts, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-12-00447-f010">Figure 10</xref>). Similarly, 29 entities were present in both the leaf and shoot extracts but absent in the root extracts, whereas the number of mutually shared entities between the shoot and root (74) or the leaf and root extracts (56) was much higher. However, the identification of these entities was generally not possible due to the lack of a match with known libraries and analytical standards for comparative purposes.
