<p>Approximately 5 g of each fresh plant tissue (roots, shoots, and leaves) from six individual plants of each biotype were extracted separately, with each plant serving as a replicate. A Buchi Speed Extractor™ (Model E-916, Flawil, Switzerland) was employed, using a programmed extraction method with 100% methanol at 35 °C for 20 min under high pressure, following the manufacturer’s recommended methods for fresh plant materials. The eluent was then collected and dried using rotary evaporation, and following the transfer of the extracts to scintillation vials, was further dried under nitrogen gas before being reconstituted in methanol at a concentration of 10 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. The crude extracts obtained from different plants of each biotype, and from all plant parts, were individually used for the bioassay and analysed for their metabolites. The experiment analysed two biotypes and three plant tissues, for each of the six plants, for a total of 36 individual samples evaluated in further metabolic profiling studies. Two extracts of each biotype and tissue type were pooled to conduct the phytotoxicity and cytotoxicity bioassays, which were replicated three times and repeated over time.
