<p>Numerous (~20) plants each of the Clermont and Toogoolawah biotypes of parthenium weed were grown in a temperature-controlled glasshouse (30/20 ± 2 °C, day/night with a 12/12-hour photoperiod) during the summer of 2017. The seeds of each biotype were sown in plastic pots (30 × 30 cm, diameter by height) filled with a heavy clay loam soil which was found to be ideal for parthenium weed growth. After the initial seeding, the pots were thinned to one plant per pot. The plants were irrigated as required and were not fertilised. The plants initiated flowering between 50 and 60 days after sowing, and both biotypes reached maximal flowering after 70 days. Six plants of each biotype exhibiting healthy and uniform growth were harvested at this stage. The plants were carefully uprooted from the soil and the leaves, and the shoots and roots were separated with scissors. As parthenium weed has a tap root system, the roots were easily extracted from the soil and were then gently rinsed with distilled water. All the plant material (different parts separately) was immediately placed into re-sealable plastic bags and stored at −20 °C until further processing.</p>
