<p>A non-targeted metabolic profiling approach was performed to analyse the metabolites contained in parthenium weed extracts of various plant tissues and biotypes. Methanolic extracts (as described above) were filtered through a 0.22 µm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter and analysed with an Agilent 1290 Infinity UHPLC system equipped with a quaternary pump, diode array detector, degasser, temperature-controlled column and cooled autosampler compartments and coupled to an Agilent 6530 Q-TOF mass spectrometer with Agilent Dual Jet Stream ionisation source (Agilent Technologies, Melbourne, Australia). The extracts were separated using a C
 <sub>18</sub> Poroshell column (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 2.7 µm particle size) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) at 25 °C, which was preceded by a SB-C
 <sub>8</sub> guard column (2.1 mm × 12.5 mm, 5 µm particle size) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The flow rate of the mobile phase was 0.5 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The column was equilibrated for 40 min prior to analysis. The separation was obtained using a gradient of solvent A (water, 0.1% formic acid) and solvent B (95% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). A stepwise linear gradient was employed commencing with 5% B for 1 min and ramping to 100% B over 16 min, where it remained until 25 min. The Q-TOF was calibrated in positive ion mode with nebuliser gas set at 35 psig, capillary voltage at 3500 V and fragmentor voltage at 135 V. Nitrogen was used as the drying gas at 250 °C at a flow of 9 L min
