<p>The metabolites were identified by comparison with known standards and by matching the molecular features and molecular formulae as previously reported in the literature (
 <xref rid="toxins-12-00447-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The absolute quantitation of parthenin in all the extracts was determined by comparison with a standard curve prepared from technical grade parthenin. However, the relative abundance of other metabolites present was determined by annotation with the comparison of known molecular features as reported in the literature. Molecular features were extracted from data files using Profinder (ver. 8.0, Agilent Technologies, Melbourne, Australia), and the graphical presentation of metabolomics data was generated by Mass Profiler Professional (ver. 13.0, Agilent Technologies, Melbourne, Australia).
