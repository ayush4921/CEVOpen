<p>The data were subjected to a factorial analysis of variance to evaluate the significance of the treatment factors and interaction effects using Statistix (ver. 8.1, Tallahassee, FL, USA). The percent inhibition of seed germination, radicle length, hypocotyl length, and cell death was regressed against the log of the extract concentrations using a linear regression model in SigmaPlot (ver. 14, Chicago, IL, country). The extract concentrations responsible for the 50% inhibition of the total response (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) were estimated for various parameters using generated regression equations. The statistical relationships between the metabolites separated via LCâ€“MS and the respective bioactivity were tested using stepwise linear regression via SPSS (ver. 24, IBM Corporation, Chicago, IL USA). All the models used forward selection with no components starting in the model, with
