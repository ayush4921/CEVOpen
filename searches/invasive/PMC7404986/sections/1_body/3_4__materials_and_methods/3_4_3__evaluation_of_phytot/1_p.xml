<p>Methanolic extracts (10 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) of leaf, shoot and root tissues were serially diluted further in methanol to produce a concentration gradient i.e., 0.12, 0.25, 0.50, 1.00 and 2.00 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. The extracts were then applied uniformly (0.5 mL) to Whatman No. 1 filter papers in glass Petri dishes (30 mm diameter) and the treatments were replicated three times. A treatment of 0.5 mL methanol alone was the vehicle-only control. After solvent evaporation in a fume cabinet, each dish was individually moistened with 0.5 mL distilled water. Ten seeds of cress (
 <italic>Lepidium sativum</italic> L.) or annual ryegrass (
 <italic>Lolium rigidum</italic> Gaud.) were utilised as the seed indicators for the bioassay of phytotoxicity, and were placed on the moistened filter paper in each dish. The dishes were then covered and placed in a germination box that was maintained in a humid environment, after randomization in a completely randomized design. The dishes were incubated at 25 °C in the dark for 24 (garden cress) or 36 (annual ryegrass) hours. After this time, the germination percentage, radicle length and hypocotyl length of germinated seedlings were recorded. The seedlings with a radicle length of &gt;1 mm were considered as having germinated. The percentage inhibition of germination and the length of radicles and hypocotyls relative to the control was calculated [
