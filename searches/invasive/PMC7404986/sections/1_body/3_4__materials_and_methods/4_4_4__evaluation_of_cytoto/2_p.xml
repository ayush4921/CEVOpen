<p>After the UV-A or sham exposure, the culture medium in all the wells was removed and replaced with a fresh cell culture medium before the plates were returned to the incubator for a further 48 h incubation, prior to the analysis of cytotoxicity using a standard colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (Invitrogen, ThermoFisher, Melbourne, Australia). In this bioassay, the yellow MTT reagent was converted to a purple formazan precipitate in metabolically active cells by the mitochondrial dehydrogenases of living cells. The precipitate was then dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and the absorbance was measured using a spectrophotometer at 540 nm (Versamax™, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The viability of the treated cells was presented relative to the untreated control. Following the initial screening for cytotoxicity and photocytotoxicity caused by various plant extracts, the experiment was repeated with a wider range of concentrations with only leaf tissue extracts (0.008 to 0.25 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) to enable the calculation of respective IC
 <sub>50</sub> values. The extracts of other tissues (shoot and root) were not evaluated further as they exhibited limited activity in the initial screening experiment.
