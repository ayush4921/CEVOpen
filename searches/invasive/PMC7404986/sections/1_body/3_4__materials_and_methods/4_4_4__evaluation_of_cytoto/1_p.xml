<p>The cytotoxicity of methanolic extracts was evaluated against the mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line NIH3T3. Briefly, the cells were expanded in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Life Sciences) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Bovogen, Keilor East VIC, Australia) in 5% carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub>2</sub>) at 37 °C. The cells were seeded at a rate of 5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> per well in 96-well plates and incubated until 80% confluency was reached. The following day, the crude extracts (10 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) of the leaf, shoot and root tissues described above were mixed with the cell culture media to produce serial doubling dilutions ranging from 0.0625 to 0.5 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. As additional experimental controls, the cells maintained in a culture medium or with equivalent volumes of methanol-containing media as a vehicle-only control were also included in the study. A known photosensitising agent, 8-methoxypsoralen (Sigma Aldrich, Castle Hill NSW Australia), was compared at a concentration of 10 µM as a positive appropriate control for comparative photocytotoxicity. The cultures were maintained at 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and 37 °C for 4 h in the presence of extracts. Each experiment was performed in parallel on two 96 well-plates, with one exposed to UV-A (Vilber Bio-Sun illumination system, Marine, France with the UV dose measured using a Vilber radiometer, while the second plate was maintained in the dark for the same period (sham exposure). A uniform UV-A dose of 2 J cm
 <sup>−2</sup> was applied in all experiments.
