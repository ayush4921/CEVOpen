<p>The higher sensitivity of the dicot (garden cress) compared to the monocot species (annual ryegrass) assayed in this study is potentially due to the differences in selectivity associated with the chemical composition of the extracts. The potential differences in the seed structure, seed coat texture and membrane permeability of the two species might also have played an important role in their differential sensitivity. In a previous study, the germination and early growth of billygoat weed (
 <italic>Ageratum conyzoides</italic> L.) were most sensitive to the crude leaf extracts of parthenium weed as well as to parthenin as compared to monocot species, barnyard grass (
 <italic>Echinochloa crus-galli</italic> (L.) P. Beauv.), African love grass (
 <italic>Eragrostis curvula</italic> (Schrad) Nees) and teff (
 <italic>Eragrostis tef</italic> (Zucc.) Trotter) [
