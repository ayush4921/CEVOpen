<p>Numerous unrelated sesquiterpene lactones [

 <xref rid="B36-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] have been reported as potent phytotoxins and may also play protective roles under biotic and abiotic stresses [

 <xref rid="B36-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Several sesquiterpene lactones from sunflower (
 <italic>Helianthus annuus</italic> L.) including annuolide H, helivypolides F, and helieudesmanolide A were found to be extremely toxic to both monocot and dicot plant species at concentrations of 1 to 100 μM [

 <xref rid="B35-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The α-methylene-γ-lactone moiety has been associated with the activity of most sesquiterpene lactones [
 <xref rid="B36-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which are known to inhibit the seed germination and seedling growth by cross reacting with the sulfhydryl-groups of amino acids, by inhibiting the cell division or by reducing the activities of important enzymes such as dehydrogenases, proteases, and peroxidases [
 <xref rid="B37-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, the sesquiterpenes under study in these experiments proved not to be particularly phytotoxic under the conditions evaluated, including parthenin as a purified standard.
