<p>Chlorogenic acid, a phenolic compound, was correlated with the inhibition of radicle elongation in the present study; this compound has previously been identified as a potent allelochemical in many species including parthenium weed [

 <xref rid="B42-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. For example, chlorogenic acid was found to inhibit the growth of lettuce seedlings at concentrations above 100 Î¼M [

Most phenolics of parthenium weed were reported to influence the germination and growth of other plants, not only through direct phytotoxicity but also through the manipulation of the physicochemical properties of soil and nutrient availability [

 <xref rid="B9-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], most do not exhibit strong phytotoxicity over more than a 24 h period as they are highly labile in soil conditions and therefore, the involvement of other potential secondary metabolites has been suggested [
