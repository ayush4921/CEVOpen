<p>Another sesquiterpene lactone, ambrosin, was associated with the germination inhibition of the test species in this study; this compound is a well known allelochemical of parthenium weed [
 <xref rid="B8-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Ambrosin has also been isolated from sea ragweed (
 <italic>Ambrosia maritima</italic> L.) and was found to be a strong inhibitor of germination, radicle elongation and the hypocotyl elongation of wild oat seeds [
 <xref rid="B34-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We found ambrosin levels to be correlated with the inhibition of young seedling growth but not seed germination, similar to artemisinin and other sesquiterpene lactone analogues [

 <xref rid="B37-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The enhanced activity of ambrosin could potentially be due to possibly greater absorption and transport through cellular membranes [
