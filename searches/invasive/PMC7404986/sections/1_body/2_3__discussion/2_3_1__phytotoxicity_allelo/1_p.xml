<p>The higher phytotoxic potential of the leaf extracts of parthenium weed noted in this study is consistent with other reports in the literature. Leaf extracts or litter/residues of aboveground parts of parthenium weed exhibited allelopathic effects on a range of monocot and dicot crop, pasture or weed species [

 <xref rid="B31-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] reported that the leaf extracts and leaf residues of parthenium weed were more inhibitory to the germination and early seedling growth of wild oat (
 <italic>Avena fatua</italic> L.) and little seed canarygrass (
 <italic>Phalaris minor</italic> Retz.), compared to the whole-plant or root extracts and/or residues in the Petri dish and soil bioassays. Parthenium weed allelopathy in field studies has been previously associated with above-ground plant parts [

 <xref rid="B13-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, the phytotoxicity observed in the controlled laboratory assays with extracts at high concentrations is frequently not indicative of allelopathic activity under field conditions [
