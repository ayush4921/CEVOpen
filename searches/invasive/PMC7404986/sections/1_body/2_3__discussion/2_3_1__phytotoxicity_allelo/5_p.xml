<p>Parthenin has remained the focus of numerous studies evaluating the allelopathic potential of parthenium weed [

 <xref rid="B38-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It is produced and sequestered in the highest concentrations in the leaf trichomes of parthenium weed, but it is not transported to the roots [

 <xref rid="B33-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, phytotoxicity exhibited by leaf extracts or leaf litter could be well associated with this chemical but potentially not with any root-related allelopathy of parthenium weed [
 <xref rid="B13-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In fact, Belz, van der Laan, Reinhardt and Hurle [
 <xref rid="B14-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] reported that parthenin degraded quickly in the soil due to microbial activity, and we also observed a lack of activity under high ultraviolet A (UV-A), suggesting its lability. Although parthenin was the most abundant compound in the leaf extracts, it was also not significantly correlated with the phytotoxicity observed in the present study. Parthenin also exhibited moderate phytotoxicity compared to potent allelochemicals such as sorgoleone and 
 <italic>m</italic>-tyrosine which produced IC
 <sub>50</sub> values as low as 10 and 8 Î¼M, respectively [

 <xref rid="B40-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Parthenin has exhibited auxin-like hormetic effects at low concentrations but the exact mechanism of bioactivity of this compound is unclear [
