<p>Several unidentified metabolites in this study showed strong correlations with various measures of phytotoxicity, and our observations of their structure from mass fragmentation patterns and molecular weight suggest that these compounds could potentially be derivatives of parthenin, which was not unexpected because of the proclivity of sesquiterpenoids to undergo transformation in the environment [

 <xref rid="B45-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] reported that some derivatives of parthenin were more active than parthenin itself, and Belz, Reinhardt, Foxcroft and Hurle [
 <xref rid="B13-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] found that the allelopathic activity of crude leaf extracts of parthenium was greater than that of parthenin, with the relative contribution of parthenin to the overall allelopathy of leaf extracts varying significantly for different test species. The balance of evidence suggests that parthenin is probably not the most active allelochemical in parthenium weed leaf extracts, as suggested by Belz, Reinhardt, Foxcroft and Hurle [
 <xref rid="B13-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Various extracts or mixtures of sesquiterpene lactones and phenolic acids may act synergistically, contributing to the enhanced phytotoxicity of the crude leaf extracts of parthenium weed.
