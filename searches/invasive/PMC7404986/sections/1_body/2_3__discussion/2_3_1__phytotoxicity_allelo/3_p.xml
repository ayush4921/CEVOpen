<p>The leaf tissues of parthenium weed have been reported to possess several secondary metabolites associated with its phytotoxic potential [

 <xref rid="B33-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In the present study, the relative abundance of most metabolites of interest was higher in the leaf extracts than in the root or stem, which is consistent with the observed phytotoxic potential. Sesquiterpene lactones were noted to predominate in the bioactive extracts of parthenium weed and other closely related species in
