<p>The results of this study revealed that the leaf tissue extracts of parthenium weed are toxic to garden cress, annual ryegrass, and murine fibroblasts; however, the cytotoxicity was enhanced upon the exposure to UV-A radiation. which suggests the presence of potential photosensitizing agents in these extracts [

 <xref rid="B30-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Parthenium weed biotypes did not differ significantly with respect to toxicity, except for phytotoxicity in garden cress, as the Clermont biotype was slightly more toxic than the Toogoolawah biotype. These findings suggest that plant toxicity is not likely to be closely associated with their contrasting invasion success [
