<p>The results of previous studies suggest that the invasion success of parthenium weed is due to the lack of natural enemies in the introduced range, resilient biology and also rapid evolutionary adaptations related to growth and development [

 <xref rid="B3-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Recent studies have revealed that prolific seed production, germination ability under harsh conditions, vigorous growth habit, and the capacity to tolerate abiotic stresses through morphological and physiological adaptations are the major factors responsible for the invasion success of parthenium weed, in general, and of the Clermont biotype, in particular [

 <xref rid="B25-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Although secondary chemistry plays a significant role in deterring the herbivory of parthenium weed, it appears to be relatively less important in the success of highly invasive biotypes.
