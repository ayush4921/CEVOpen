<p>There were no major differences in the toxicity of the extracts of the Clermont and Toogoolawah biotypes of parthenium weed. Previous studies evaluating the allelopathic effects of leaf litter from both these biotypes also reported no differences in the potency of these two biotypes [
 <xref rid="B6-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This suggests that the invasive potential of the two biotypes in Australia is not dependent on phytotoxicity. However, significant differences have been reported in the phytotoxicity of parthenium biotypes from its native and introduced range, with the latter being more active against several plant species [

 <xref rid="B50-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] also reported that parthenin and coronopilin concentrations were similar in the Clermont and Toogoolawah biotypes (in the introduced range) while both these compounds were absent in a biotype from Argentina (native range) that possessed another sesquiterpene lactone, hymenin, instead. Picman, et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] reported that most parthenium weed biotypes from its introduced range (Australia, India and South Africa) produced similar sesquiterpene lactones (mainly parthenin and coronopilin) to those present in North American biotypes; however, South American biotypes produced hymenin as their major sesquiterpene lactone. Hence, the authors suggested that most biotypes in the introduced range came from North America [
 <xref rid="B51-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In contrast, South American biotypes of parthenium weed have shown remarkable diversity in their sesquiterpene lactone chemistry [
