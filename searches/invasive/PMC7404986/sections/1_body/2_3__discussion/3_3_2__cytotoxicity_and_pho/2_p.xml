<p>The strong correlation between parthenin and cytotoxicity observed in this study is consistent with previous reports [

 <xref rid="B47-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Parthenin itself was highly cytotoxic to bovine kidney cells by inhibiting the synthesis of RNA, DNA and key cellular enzymes within 24 h after exposure [
 <xref rid="B47-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Similarly, other sesquiterpene lactones including ambrosin, coronopilin, tetraneurin A and hysterone D, and some acetylated pseudoguaianolides have been associated with the cytotoxicity of aerial parts of parthenium weed [

 <xref rid="B49-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The α-methylene-γ-lactone moiety was suggested to be responsible for cytotoxicity for most of these compounds [
 <xref rid="B49-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In addition to parthenin, two unidentified compounds were strongly correlated with cytotoxicity in the present study; these might be derivatives of parthenin or other unidentified sesquiterpene lactones. Interestingly, parthenin abundance was found to be uncorrelated with photocytotoxicity, but it is also possible that parthenin lability under light accounts for this lack of activity. The literature also suggests that cytotoxic and photocytotoxic activities may not be interrelated and that entirely different metabolites could be associated with each form of toxicity [
 <xref rid="B29-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, the observation that two metabolites were highly correlated with 99% photocytotoxicity observed in the cell assay (
 <xref rid="toxins-12-00447-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) suggests that the leaf extracts of parthenium weed possesses potent photosensitisers. Photocytotoxicity requires the presence of light-absorbing molecular features such as a porphyrin ring (found in chlorophyll or its breakdown products) or other conjugated double-bond moieties. The putative molecular formulae and retention times of the entities associated with photocytotoxicity in this study suggest the involvement of breakdown products of chlorophyll; chlorophyll breakdown products containing a porphyrin ring would contain at least four nitrogen atoms and elute at 17–22 min under the chromatographic conditions used in this study.
