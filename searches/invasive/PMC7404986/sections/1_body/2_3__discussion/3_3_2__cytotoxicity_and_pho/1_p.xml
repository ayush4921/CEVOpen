<p>Parthenium weed extracts exhibit stronger cytotoxicity under exposure to UV-A radiation, suggesting that this species causes photosensitization in animals and humans [
 <xref rid="B29-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The lower cytotoxicity/photocytotoxicity exhibited by the shoot and root extracts as compared to the leaf extracts of parthenium weed may be associated with the significantly higher levels of parthenin in the leaf extracts. The literature suggests that the deposition of higher amounts of parthenin in leaf trichomes is a defence strategy of parthenium weed against herbivory [
 <xref rid="B20-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The production of parthenin typically peaks at the start of flowering, a vital stage in the life of the plant when herbivory needs to be prevented [
 <xref rid="B33-toxins-12-00447" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This is the stage when the samples were collected in the present study and parthenin was also observed to be highly abundant in the leaf extracts.
