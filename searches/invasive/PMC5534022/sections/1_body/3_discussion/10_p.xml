<p>We are not the first to document the limitations of plant community monitoring: a recent meta-analysis reported on inconsistencies in outcomes using this approach (

 </xref>), but is less effective at capturing recovery after deer reduction. Furthermore, community monitoring can be a powerful tool but requires substantial expertise to identify all plants to species, and is time consuming and hence expensive. Our results show that it also may not be the best approach to capture the initial response of vegetation to deer reductions. Monitoring individual deer-favoured plant species is both easier and less time-consuming assuming they still exist in local forests albeit at greatly reduced abundances. The response of individuals of deer favoured plant species clearly demonstrates that abundant deer herbivory reduces performance of these species, potentially for decades.
