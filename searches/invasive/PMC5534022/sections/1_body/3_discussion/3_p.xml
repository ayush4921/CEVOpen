<p>Our first hypothesis was articulated in anticipation of a demographic response of those species that have suffered high browse intensity over extended time periods. Neither at West Point, nor at Fermilab, did we have access to detailed community composition data from before deer population increases, thus we are not fully able to “ground truth” the response, or better lack thereof, of the understory vegetation community. But in both regions floras and early forest community descriptions imply substantially different plant community compositions (
