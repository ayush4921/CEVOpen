<p>Our work confirms the work by others that non-native vegetation cover, abundance, growth and population growth rates decline when deer browse pressure is reduced or even eliminated (

 <italic>et al.</italic> (this issue). We suggest that non-native plants, at least the three species in our study (
 <italic>A. petiolata, B. thunbergii, M. vimineum</italic>) are indicators of earthworm invasion and high deer abundance, and that these two factors pose greater threats, singly and in combination, to native vegetation than do non-native plants.
