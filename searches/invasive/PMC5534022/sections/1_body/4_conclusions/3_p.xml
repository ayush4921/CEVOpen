<p>Land managers need to appropriately define recovery goals of deer management and develop suitable metrics. Defining recovery through growth, ability to reproduce and positive population growth rates for individual species is more appropriate than simply stating ‘increased species diversity’ or ‘increased native cover’. Reducing deer populations may provide safe spaces for recovery of deer sensitive species, but active restoration may be required if we want to retain these species as part of our ecosystems.</p>
