<p>Over the 14-year study period we recorded a total of 153 species (13 graminoids, 21 (bi)annuals, 2 ferns, 82 perennial forbs, and 35 woody species), with 77–102 species recorded/year. The majority of species (86 %) were native. Species richness from 1992 to 2006 averaged 9.1 ± 0.15 species per 1 m
 <sup>2</sup> quadrat and significantly increased from an average of 7.0 species per quadrat in 1992 to 12.2 species per quadrat in 2006 (+74 %;
