<p>PerMANOVA results indicated that species composition differed according to earthworm density (

 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>=0.002;

 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> values). We found no significant year effect, and no interactions between study year and fencing or earthworms on plant species composition. The interaction between earthworm density and fencing did not change over time and therefore we do not attribute it to our fencing treatment.
