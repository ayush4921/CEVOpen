<p>Proportion of cover contributed by native vs non-native plant species shifted over the study period, influenced by both fencing and non-native earthworm abundance. Native plant species cover significantly increased from 2009 to 2012, whereas non-native plant species cover remained stable (significant origin × year interaction;
