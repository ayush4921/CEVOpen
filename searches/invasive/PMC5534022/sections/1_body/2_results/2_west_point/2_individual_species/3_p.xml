<p>We measured 109 
 <italic>P. pubescens</italic> stems in 2012 and 274 in 2016. Similar to 
 <italic>M. racemosum</italic> we recorded fewer stems in open (45 and 51 in 2012 and 2016, respectively) compared with fenced plots (64 and 223 in 2012 and 2016, respectively) despite the larger sampling area in open plots. We found a significant positive effect of fencing on stem height (22.32 ± 0.82 cm in fenced vs 13 ± 1.62 cm in open; Est ± 1SE: −0.56 ± 0.12, 
 <italic>t</italic>=−4.67, 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>=6.9, df = 1, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.01). In contrast, leaf width did not differ between open and fenced plots (2.6 ± 0.08 cm in fenced vs 1.7 ± 0.12 cm in open; 
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plx026-F10">Fig. 10</xref>). At site 5, plants had a significantly higher probability of flowering in fenced than open plots (Est ± 1SE: −1.19 ± 0.43, 
 <italic>z</italic> = 2.73, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.006). At site 8, we recorded only one flowering individual in the open plot in 2012 and no flowering individuals in 2016, preventing formal analysis. Nevertheless, 41 % and 43 % of plants in the fenced plot flowered in 2012 and 2016, respectively. Flowering plants were significantly taller than non-flowering plants (Est ± 1SE: 0.99 ± 0.05, 
 <italic>t</italic> = 20.69, 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>=287.9, df = 1, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001).
