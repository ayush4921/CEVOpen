<p>We were particularly interested to assess the response of herbaceous understory vegetation to deer management in the presence of other persistent stressors, such as introduced plants and non-native earthworm invasions. We used a 90â€‰% reduction in the deer herd at Fermilab, IL, USA and an exclosure network at West Point, NY, USA, to test the following hypotheses: 
 <list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
   <p>Reduced deer browse pressure will result in recovery of forest understory plant community.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Reduced deer browse pressure will result in recovery of species highly favoured by deer.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Deer browse pressure overwhelms negative effects of other co-occurring stressors, specifically non-native plants and non-native earthworms, on native plant species performance</p>
