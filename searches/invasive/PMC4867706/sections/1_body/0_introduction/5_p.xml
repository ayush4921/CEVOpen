<p>Possibly the initial spread of 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> was facilitated by an absence of natural enemies; for example, 
 <xref rid="ref-60" ref-type="bibr">Reinhart et al. (2003)</xref> found that, in the native range, soil pathogens inhibit the establishment of 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> seedlings near conspecifics, whereas in the invaded range, the species-specific soil community facilitates establishment. However, it is to be expected that the rich resource which 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> constitutes will provide adaptive opportunities for phytophagous insects to exploit. Such an evolutionary process will be even more likely if 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> represents an enemy-free space for herbivores (see 
 <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">Feder (1995)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">Karolewski et al. (2014)</xref> for examples in other plants), and if it has been evolving reduced herbivore defences (
 <xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">Blossey &amp; NÃ¶tzold, 1995</xref>). The changes in chemical defences may be complex. 
 <xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">Joshi &amp; Vrieling (2005)</xref> found that invasive plants may increase energetically cheap defences aimed at generalist herbivores, while reducing costly defences aimed at specialists when these specialists are no longer present.
