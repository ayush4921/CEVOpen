<p>In this paper, we investigate the composition of the insect herbivore community feeding on 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> in the Netherlands. Because congenerics are likely to have been an important source of colonists, we compare the 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> herbivore community with the one occurring locally on 
 <italic>P. padus</italic>, its closest native relative in the Netherlands (
 <xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">Bortiri et al., 2001</xref>). To obtain an impression of the accumulation of herbivory in 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic>, herbivore damage in both 
 <italic>Prunus</italic> species is quantified on the basis of herbarium records. We then investigate the impact that two conditions may have had on herbivore presence: cyanogenic defence compounds and parasitoid attack, in both 
 <italic>Prunus</italic> species. Finally, as an example of the adaptive evolution that specialist 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> herbivores may have undergone, we studied host preference and genomics in one particular 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> herbivore, the leaf beetle 
 <italic>Gonioctena quinquepunctata</italic>.
