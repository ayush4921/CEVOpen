<p>One prominent invasive plant species in Europe is the black cherry, 
 <italic>Prunus serotina</italic> Ehrh, native of eastern North America and considered a “forest pest” in Europe after widespread planting as auxiliary tree in pine plantations throughout the 20th century (

 <xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">Bakker, 1963</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-69" ref-type="bibr">Starfinger et al., 2003</xref>). Being bird-dispersed, it has been rapidly invading forested and open habitats (

 <xref rid="ref-69" ref-type="bibr">Starfinger et al., 2003</xref>), it is now considered one of the most important threats to habitat quality of vegetation on dry, acidic, and/or poor soil, such as dunes and moorland (

 <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">Godefroid et al., 2005</xref>). In the Netherlands, for example, 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> has increased in distribution and abundance by at least two orders of magnitude during the second half of the 20th century (
 <xref rid="ref-71" ref-type="bibr">Tamis et al., 2005</xref>). Current control measures (chemical and mechanical eradication) are temporary and cosmetic (
 <xref rid="ref-69" ref-type="bibr">Starfinger et al., 2003</xref>). Nonetheless, they are costly: 
 <xref rid="ref-59" ref-type="bibr">Reinhardt et al. (2003)</xref> conservatively calculated the annual cost of 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> control in Germany to be ca. 25 million euros.
