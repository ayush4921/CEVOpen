<p>As a possible example of this scenario, we performed a case study on one specialist herbivore, the leaf beetle 
 <italic>G. quinquepunctata</italic>, which has recently colonized 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> from its original host, rowan (
 <italic>S. aucuparia</italic>). We find indications of weak differentiation in host preference and SNP-loci on 
 <italic>Sorbus</italic>- versus 
 <italic>Prunus</italic>-derived beetle individuals. We found that individuals collected on 
 <italic>Sorbus</italic> retained a significant host preference for this host, whereas beetles collected from 
 <italic>Prunus</italic> showed no preference for 
 <italic>Prunus</italic> over 
 <italic>Sorbus</italic>. We found the same host preference in adults and larvae, although presumably host choice is made mostly in the mobile, adult stage. While these results do not necessarily imply genetic differentiation, as learning may be involved as well (
 <xref rid="ref-62" ref-type="bibr">Salloum, Colson &amp; Marion-Poll, 2011</xref>), our SNP-analysis does show indications of weak genetic differentiation, with several loci showing divergence, and potentially linked to regions that are under disruptive, host-imposed selection. In other words, the introduced 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> may have selected for weak, incipient divergence (
 <xref rid="ref-75" ref-type="bibr">Vellend et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr">Nosil &amp; Feder, 2011</xref>) in this particular herbivore. Whether such selection will allow further sympatric speciation, in this herbivore or others, depends not only on the different selection regimes imposed by the different host plants, but also on the mount of gene-flow between the populations feeding on the two hosts (
 <xref rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr">Nosil &amp; Feder, 2011</xref>).
