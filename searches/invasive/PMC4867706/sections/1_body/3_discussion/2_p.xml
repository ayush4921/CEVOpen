<p>These results add to a body of data on insect herbivory on native versus non-native plants (reviewed in, e.g., 
 <xref rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr">Liu &amp; Stiling, 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">Colautti et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr">Meijer, 2013</xref>). Although these studies tend to show that introduced plant species, especially those with powerful chemical defences, are poor hosts for native herbivores, exceptions have also been found of introduced species hosting a larger number of species than closely-related native plants (
 <xref rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr">Novotny et al., 2003</xref>). The rich herbivore community on non-native 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic>, and especially the high number of specialist species, fits with the observation that the food web supported by a non-native plant expands as time since initial introduction increases (
 <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Brändle et al., 2008</xref>). Although 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> was introduced into Europe earlier (
 <xref rid="ref-64" ref-type="bibr">Schütz, 1988</xref>), it only became common in the 20th century (
 <xref rid="ref-69" ref-type="bibr">Starfinger et al., 2003</xref>). Its increasing abundance in Dutch ecosystems over the past 80 years may have been the phase during which most of the herbivore community has built up. Indeed, while our study of leaf damage in herbarium specimens cannot reveal the diversity of herbivores, it does show that herbivore damage, and therefore perhaps herbivore load, has gradually doubled over this period, while that on 
 <italic>P. padus</italic> has not changed. Today, at least based on our herbarium records, herbivory levels in both plant species appear to be similar (despite the lower herbivore load that we found in our inventory for 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic>—see above).
