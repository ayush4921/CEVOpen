<p>In theory, the rapid assembly of this community may have been aided by the presence of an enemy-free space for the insect herbivores. If local parasitoids, for example, are not adapted to using 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> volatiles as a cue for attraction to a possible patch in which to find hosts, this may have helped the establishment of herbivore populations on the introduced plant (

 <xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">Harvey &amp; Fortuna, 2012</xref>). Indeed, 
 <xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">Karolewski et al. (2014)</xref> found reduced parasitization of one species, 
 <italic>Y. evonymella</italic> on 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic>. However, we find that current attack rates of caterpillars by parasitoids do not differ between 
 <italic>P. padus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic>.
