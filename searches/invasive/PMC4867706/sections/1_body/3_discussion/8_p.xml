<p>These results may have implications for invasive species management. It may be expected that the gradual evolutionary integration of a novel plant species in a native herbivore food web may eventually reduce its invasive character to the point where it attains the status of non-harmful, naturalized neophyte. Whether this will happen in the case of 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> depends on a number of factors. In this paper, we dealt with herbivorous insects only, whereas plant demographics are affected by a much broader spectrum of natural enemies. 
 <xref rid="ref-60" ref-type="bibr">Reinhart et al. (2003)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ref-72" ref-type="bibr">Van der Putten (2000)</xref> suggested that its invasiveness may be more due to an absence of belowground interactions (with the 
 <italic>Prunus</italic>-pathogenic fungus 
 <italic>Pythium</italic>, for example) than aboveground interactions. However, preliminary studies in the Netherlands indicate the presence of local 
 <italic>Pythium</italic> populations that are powerful in attacking introduced 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> (Tamis &amp; Van der Klugt, pers. comm., 2015). Furthermore, 
 <xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">Ballhorn, Pietrowski &amp; Lieberei (2010b)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Ballhorn (2011)</xref> found that in cyanogenic plants a trade-off exists between defence against herbivores and against fungal pathogens, which is an additional complication not yet considered. A final point of concern is the intensity of the regime of natural selection. Presently, manual control of mature 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> in many European habitats is reducing the continued exposure of the host to its potential herbivores. On the basis of the results presented here, we would like to caution that this might have the adverse effect of a consequent slowing down of processes of adaptation, and a delay in the decline of the invasive character of 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic>.
