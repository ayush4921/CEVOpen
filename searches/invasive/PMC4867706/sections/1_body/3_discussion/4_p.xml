<p>After an initial period of reduced specialist herbivory in the non-native range, 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> may have shifted its investment in chemical defences in favour of those aimed at generalists (
 <xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">Joshi &amp; Vrieling, 2005</xref>). Cyanogenic glycosides are generally considered to be systemic, non-inducible, and energetically cheap chemical defences aimed primarily at generalist herbivores (
 <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Gleadow &amp; Møller, 2014</xref>). However, our phytochemical data suggest that, in 
 <italic>P. padus</italic> (and, less clearly, in 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic>), the Rosaceae-specific compound amygdalin has a positive relationship with generalist load but a negative one with specialist load, whereas the more widespread compound prunasin has a positive correlation with specialist herbivore load, while lacking any clear relation with generalist load. It would be tempting to compare the levels and ratios of prunasin and amygdalin in today’s 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> populations in the Netherlands with those reported for the native American population. However, we only have access to a single American study (
 <xref rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr">Santamour, 1998</xref>), which, moreover, employed somewhat different methods (see below), so we do so with considerable hesitation. 
 <xref rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr">Santamour (1998)</xref> reported a summertime HCN production in native American 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> corresponding to 29.6 mg cyanogenic glycosides per g fresh leaf material (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2">Text S2</xref>). In an earlier study of 22 Dutch 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> trees (
 <xref rid="ref-54" ref-type="bibr">Pimenta et al., 2014</xref>), we found on average 30.4 mg cyanogenic glycosides per mg 
 <italic>dry</italic> leaf material. As 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> dry leaf weight is 36% of fresh leaf weight (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2">Text S2</xref>), this might suggest that total cyanogenic glycoside content in the invaded range could be about two- to threefold lower than in North America. Also, Santamour found prunasin : amygdalin proportions of 22:1, whereas we found a ratio of 3:1. In the Dutch 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic>, prunasin investment might therefore have decreased, with amygdalin content remaining more or less constant. Since both the absolute and relative amounts of prunasin and amygdalin content have a genetic basis (
 <xref rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr">Santamour, 1998</xref>), these results might indicate that cyanogenic glycoside defence has, after the introduction into Europe, adapted to the novel herbivore communities. With a mean age at first reproduction of only 5.2 years (
 <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Deckers et al., 2005</xref>) and evidence, in general, of rapid evolution of defence in invasive plants (
 <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Felker-Quinn, Schweitzer &amp; Bailey, 2013</xref>), such a quick evolutionary change is not implausible. However, since 
 <xref rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr">Santamour (1998)</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref-54" ref-type="bibr">Pimenta et al. (2014)</xref> and the present study appear to be the only available quantifications of prunasin and amygdalin in 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic>, and since the range of phenotypic plasticity in cyanogenic glycoside content is unknown, more data, with more comparable methods, are needed before this conclusion can be substantiated. Moreover, we stress that our results and their discussion refer only to the cyanogenic potential (HCNp), whereas the true defence potential is a combination of HCNp and HCNc, cyanogenic capacity, which is a function of glucosidase presence and activity. Since the latter is unknown in this study, we implicitly assume that HCNp is an indicator for cyanogenic defence, which may only be partly true and is known to differ between specialists and generalists (
