<p>Overall, our results indicate that, since its introduction, a rich and diverse herbivore community has accumulated on 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic>. It is possible that evolutionary adaptations in these herbivores as well as in the plant itself have played an important role in shaping this community. Adaptation may have involved niche widening in generalist herbivores, incipient genetic divergence in specialists, as well as adjustments of chemical defences in the host plant.
