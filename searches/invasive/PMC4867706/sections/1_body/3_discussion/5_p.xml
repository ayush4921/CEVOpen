<p>The accumulation of the herbivore community on 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> may also have involved evolutionary processes within the insect community itself. One possibility is that all present-day herbivores were able to feed and reproduce on 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> from the moment the new host was introduced. However, this would not explain the 
 <italic>slow</italic> increase in herbivory that our herbarium data show: highly mobile insects with short generation times would have established on the new host instantaneously, rather than gradually. It is therefore likely that adaptive evolution in the herbivores played an important role in the assembly of this community over time.
