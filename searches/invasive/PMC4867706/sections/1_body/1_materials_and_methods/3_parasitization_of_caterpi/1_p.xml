<p>Within the same 2 × 2 km area as mentioned above, we sampled 173 and 110 live caterpillars from 43 
 <italic>P. padus</italic> and 32 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> trees, respectively, between May 18th and June 3rd, 2011. All caterpillars were reared in individual vials. If a caterpillar metamorphosed into an adult moth or butterfly, it was considered unparasitized. If a parasitoid wasp or fly emerged, the host was considered parasitized. Caterpillars or pupae from which no adult insect had emerged by June 19th, were dissected in ethanol or Ringer’s solution to determine the presence or absence of parasitoid eggs, larvae, pupae, or adults (
 <xref rid="ref-82" ref-type="bibr">Zchori-Fein et al., 2001</xref>). When found, these hosts were also considered as parasitized. Models describing the binominal response variable “parasitized” (Y/N) with combinations and interactions of the following explanatory variables: tree, method, xylosteana, and tree-ID (which was added as a random effect) were created and analysed in R 2.12.1 (
 <xref rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr">R Development Core Team, 2010</xref>). “Tree” was the caterpillar’s host plant species (
 <italic>P. padus</italic>/
 <italic>P. serotina</italic>). “Method” was the way a caterpillar was determined to have been parasitized or not (dissected in ethanol, dissected in Ringer’s solution, or reared to adult or parasitoid emergence). “Xylosteana” indicated if the caterpillars belonged to the most commonly encountered species, 
 <italic>Archips xylosteana</italic> (TRUE) or another species (FALSE). Of the identified caterpillars, all other species were not present in sufficient numbers (&lt;8) for species-level analysis.
