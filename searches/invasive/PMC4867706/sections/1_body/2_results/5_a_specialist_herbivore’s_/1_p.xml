<p>At the end of the host choice experiment, 52% of all experimental 
 <italic>G. quinquepunctata</italic> were present on one of the host plants. Individuals collected on 
 <italic>S. aucuparia</italic> showed a significant preference for 
 <italic>S. aucuparia</italic> (69.7 ± 3.1%) over 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). However, individuals collected on 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> showed no significant preference for either host. Similar patterns were found in both adults and larvae: individuals from 
 <italic>S. aucuparia</italic> preferred their original host (75.9 ± 7.0 % for adults, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, and 65.9 ± 9.0% for larvae, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0003); individuals from 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> showed no preference (58.7 ± 9.1% for adults, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.2077, and 57.9 ± 14.3% for larvae, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.2893). Full test results are available in
