<p>Illumina sequencing of a 
 <italic>G. quinquepunctata</italic> larva from 
 <italic>S. aucuparia</italic> gave 157,327,896 reads, and 191,340,606 reads were obtained from an adult beetle found on 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic>. The 
 <italic>de-novo</italic> assembly with Abyss resulted in 438,237 contigs longer than 200 bp. The data were deposited in the NCBI short read archive under BioProject accession code:

A total of 729 usable SNPs were obtained from the SNP discovery. To assess genetic differentiation in both host-specific subpopulations, we genotyped 379 individuals from both hosts at each of five localities, for the selected 119 SNP loci (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-6">Table S4</xref>). Our Structure analysis (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1">Text S1</xref>) failed to detect overall genetic differentiation between the populations on both host plants: the highest posterior probability was for 
 <italic>K</italic> = 2, but these two groups did not correspond with host plant nor with locality. The hierarchical AMOVA with host plants nested within localities, showed significant (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) differentiation between host plants in each locality. On a locus-by-locus basis, the AMOVA revealed 13 loci that were significantly differentiated between the two subpopulations from 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aucuparia</italic>, two of which remained significant after strict Bonferroni correction (
