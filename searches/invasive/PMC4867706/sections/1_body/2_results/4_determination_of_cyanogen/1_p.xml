<p>In the NMR-analyses (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-5">Table S3</xref>), we found that the concentration of cyanogenic glycosides (prunasin and amygdalin combined) per unit leaf dry weight is similar in both 
 <italic>Prunus</italic> species. Mean concentrations in young and old leaves differed by &lt;5% in each plant species. In both plant species, the ratio prunasin : amygdalin was c. 3 : 1. Generalist and specialist herbivores showed different relations with cyanogenic glycoside concentrations, and the responses to prunasin differed from those to amygdalin. Specifically, we found that the generalist herbivore load was not correlated with prunasin (
 <italic>R</italic> = âˆ’ 0.08, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.39, both in 
 <italic>P. prunus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic>), but increased with amygdalin concentration (
 <italic>R</italic> = 0.24 and 0.36; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.01 and 0.0001, respectively, in 
 <italic>P. padus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic>), whereas the specialist herbivore load increased with prunasin concentration, and decreased with amygdalin concentration, but significantly so only in 
 <italic>P. padus</italic> (of which the amygdalin relationship would lose significance after Bonferroni correction; see statistical test results given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4</xref>).
