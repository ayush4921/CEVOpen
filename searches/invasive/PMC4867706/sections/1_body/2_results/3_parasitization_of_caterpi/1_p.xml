<p>The percentages of parasitized caterpillars on both 
 <italic>Prunus</italic> species were not significantly different (
 <italic>P. padus</italic>: 55/173, 32%; 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic>: 43/110, 39%; chi-square =1.58; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.21). Tables of explanatory variables and response variables are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-10">Table S8</xref>. A third of all collected specimens belonged to 
 <italic>Archips xylosteana</italic>. A test of independence of the explanatory variable tree explaining the response variable “parasitized” was not significant (chi-square =1.58, 
 <italic>df</italic> = 1, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.20). A full generalized linear model was used to described the response variable “parasitized” as a three-way interaction between “tree”, “method”, and “xylosteana”. The full model was not significant, and after simplifying the model by steps, the only explanatory variable to affect parasitization significantly was the method used to determine if a specimen was infected by a parasitoid (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). The identified parasitoids mostly belonged to Ichneumonidae, Braconidae, and Tachinidae.
