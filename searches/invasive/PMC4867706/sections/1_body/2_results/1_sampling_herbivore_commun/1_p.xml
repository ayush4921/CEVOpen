<p>Our sampling method covered on average, per tree, 258 (±136 s.d.) and 141 (±91 s.d.) leaves of 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> and 
 <italic>P. padus</italic>, respectively. Given mean fresh weights of 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> and 
 <italic>P. padus</italic> leaves of 0.44 and 0.91 g, respectively, the amounts of foliage searched in 5 min were 113.5 g and 128.3 g for 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> and 
 <italic>P. padus</italic>, respectively. After correction for the 1.13×more foliage searched in 
 <italic>P. padus</italic>, we found that 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> harbors a 4.15-fold lower density but almost two-fold higher species diversity of herbivorous insects (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-1">Table 1</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-3">Table S1</xref>) than 
 <italic>P. padus</italic>. The higher herbivore load on 
 <italic>P. padus</italic> is, however, largely due to only two monophagous species, 
 <italic>Y. evonymella</italic> (Lepidoptera: Yponomeutidae) and 
 <italic>R. padi</italic> (Hemiptera: Aphididae), which usually occur in dense “nests” and “colonies”, respectively (
 <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Leather, 1985</xref>). These two species were found on 
 <italic>P. serotina</italic> at much lower densities and usually only as single individuals. Almost half of the herbivore specimens found on 
 <italic>P. padus</italic> belong to these two species. We did not find a difference in the proportions of specialists versus generalists on the native and the non-native host (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2</xref>): both species carried similar (chi-square =4.13; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.38) proportions of each of the four categories of host range (G, generalists; R, Rosaceae-specialists; P, 
 <italic>Prunus</italic>-specialists; M, 
 <italic>P. padus</italic> monophages; and O, other—mostly 
 <italic>Quercus</italic>—specialists).
