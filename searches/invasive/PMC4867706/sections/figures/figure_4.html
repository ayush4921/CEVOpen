 <caption> Cyanogenic glycosides and herbivory. Prunus padus is shown in the left column, Prunus serotina in the right column. Data for generalist herbivores are shown in the top four graphs (separately for prunasin and amygdalin), and for specialist herbivores in the bottom four graphs (also separately for prunasin and amygdalin). Pearson correlation coefficients (for the data for generalists) and Spearmanâ€™s rho (for the data for specialists) and corresponding P-values are given, and regression lines are shown for significant relationships. Note that the P-value for amygdalin vs. specialists in P. padus does not remain significant after Bonferroni correction. Herbivore loads (on the y-axis) are given as counts of individuals per tree, except in the case of specialists on P. padus, where the log was taken. Cyanogenic glycoside amounts (on the x-axis) are given as NMR signal integrals. </caption>
