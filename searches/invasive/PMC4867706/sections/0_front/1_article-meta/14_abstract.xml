 <p>The integration of invasive species into native food webs represent multifarious dynamics of ecological and evolutionary processes. We document incorporation of 
  <italic>Prunus serotina</italic> (black cherry) into native insect food webs. We find that 
  <italic>P. serotina</italic> harbours a herbivore community less dense but more diverse than its native relative, 
  <italic>P. padus</italic> (bird cherry), with similar proportions of specialists and generalists. While herbivory on 
  <italic>P. padus</italic> remained stable over the past century, that on 
  <italic>P. serotina</italic> gradually doubled. We show that 
  <italic>P. serotina</italic> may have evolved changes in investment in cyanogenic glycosides compared with its native range. In the leaf beetle 
  <italic>Gonioctena quinquepunctata</italic>, recently shifted from native 
  <italic>Sorbus aucuparia</italic> to 
  <italic>P. serotina</italic>, we find divergent host preferences on 
  <italic>Sorbus</italic>- versus 
  <italic>Prunus</italic>-derived populations, and weak host-specific differentiation among 380 individuals genotyped for 119 SNP loci. We conclude that evolutionary processes may generate a specialized herbivore community on an invasive plant, allowing prognoses of reduced invasiveness over time. On the basis of the results presented here, we would like to caution that manual control might have the adverse effect of a slowing down of processes of adaptation, and a delay in the decline of the invasive character of 
  <italic>P. serotina</italic>.
