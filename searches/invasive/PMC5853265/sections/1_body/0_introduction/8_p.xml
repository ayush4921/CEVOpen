<p>In Portugal, 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> flowering period usually peaks during winter (mainly between late December and March) (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Morais and Freitas, 2015</xref>) before most other co-occurring plants begin to flower. During these months, areas invaded by 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> are clearly visible due to their bright yellow flowering bloom. We hypothesize that the high resolution of the Remote Sensing equipment mounted in UAVs can capture this species flowering features, rarely captured via satellite due to winter cloud cover. By testing the potential for mapping the flowering of 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> we additionally aim to demonstrate its potential for monitor the future impact of the BCA. This may become a novel approach for monitoring the impact of insects on the phenological cycle of invasive plant species, ensuring low cost and repeatability.
