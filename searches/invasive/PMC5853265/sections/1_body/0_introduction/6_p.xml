<p>Unmanned aerial vehicles offer unique opportunities for Spatial Ecology because of their ability to almost on-demand acquire very high-resolution imagery (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Anderson and Gaston, 2013</xref>) and by using sensors tailored to the task as well as 3D structure of plants which will allow further inferences of plants physiological and structural traits at an unprecedented spatial scale (
