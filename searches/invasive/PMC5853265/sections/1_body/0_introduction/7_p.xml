<p>Attempts to use plant phenology to improve detection by Remote Sensing are not new (

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Khwarahm et al., 2017</xref>) but efforts like these are often hindered by lack of easily accessible and low cost data. The impact of flowering in the spectral characteristics of plants can sometimes lead to increased confusion between classes (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2011</xref>) which implies a need for deeper characterization (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Andrew and Ustin, 2006</xref>). While 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> leaf spectral responses have been thoroughly measured (

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Gro√üe-Stoltenberg et al., 2016</xref>) there is lack of similar data collected on its flowering. Mapping 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> using airborne hyperspectral sensors has been shown to be successful (
