<p>The introduction of 
 <italic>T. acaciaelongifoliae</italic> began in November 2015 with its release in eight sites along the Portuguese coast (

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Marchante et al., 2017</xref>). To ensure the success of this biocontrol measure it important to monitor its establishment and impact on 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic>. However, the fieldwork is time-consuming, expensive, and each field campaign is only capable of covering small areas. Furthermore, as the BCA population increases and spreads, it will be virtually impossible to monitor its extent only through field sampling. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) can potentially offer a cost-effective solution to address this challenge. Our assumption is that if it is possible to map the flowering of 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> using low-cost UAV platforms equipped with “off-the-shelf” digital camera sensors, then it is possible to monitor the establishment of the BCA at low cost as well. Ultimately, we expect that monitoring the loss of flowering can be used to continuously monitor the establishment of the BCA. The use of remotely sensed data has rapidly increased and has nowadays a wide range of applications in many different fields, with potential to become a key tool for ecological research and conservation (
