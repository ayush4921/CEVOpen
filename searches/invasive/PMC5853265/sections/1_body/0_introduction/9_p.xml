<p>Previous works have shown a linear relationship between the area covered by flowers in photographs captured by digital cameras and the number of flowers of 
 <italic>Lesquerella fendleri</italic> (Gray) S. Wats (an herbaceous species with regular distribution of flowers) grown in controlled experimental conditions (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Adamsen et al., 2000</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Thorp and Dierig, 2011</xref>). Based on this, our second aim is to test if such relationship exists when the plant is a woody species, 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic>, with variable distribution of flowers, occurring in the wild and using UAV imagery. This would allow making estimations of numbers of flower (or other morphological parameter) through UAV imagery.
