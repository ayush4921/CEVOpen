<p>The intentional introduction of natural enemies to control invasive plants is frequently considered as a sustainable and environmentally friendly methodology around the world (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Shaw et al., 2016</xref>). It has been used for over a century worldwide (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Murphy and Evans, 2009</xref>), with nearly 550 agents released against over 224 plant species in 130 countries (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Winston et al., 2014</xref>). Many introductions of biocontrol agents resulted in either complete (ca. 1/3 of total cases of invasive plants) or moderate (higher number of agents) levels of success (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Murphy and Evans, 2009</xref>). Despite this, biological control can be considered as potentially dangerous, current practice assures that before a species is cleared for release a full range of tests and risk analyses are performed to assure that the risk is minimal. Yet, in Europe, several reasons including (amongst others) an apparent ignorance of the potential of biological control of weeds amid policy makers and some level of risk aversion (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Sheppard and Shaw, 2006</xref>) has delayed the use of biocontrol against invasive plants until 2010. After that, it has been used three times: two in the UK, with releases in 2010 and 2014 (

 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Tanner et al., 2015</xref>), and the third in Portugal with the first release of 
 <italic>Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae</italic> (Froggatt) (
 <italic>Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae</italic>), to control 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic>, in late 2015 (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Marchante et al., 2017</xref>). It is expected that the biocontrol agent (BCA) 
 <italic>T. acaciaelongifoliae</italic> (an Australian bud galling wasp) will significantly reduce the flower production of 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> (

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Dennill et al., 1999</xref>), thus disrupting its capacity to renew the seed bank (
