 <italic>Acacia longifolia</italic> (Andrews) Willd. (Sydney Golden Wattle; 
 <italic>Fabaceae</italic>) is one of several Australian 
 <italic>Acacia</italic> species that are invasive in many regions around the world (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Rejm√°nek and Richardson, 2013</xref>) including in southern Europe where it has proliferated mostly on coastal areas (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Marchante et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Cesar de Sa et al., 2017</xref>). This leguminous shrub/small tree has a long track of diverse ecological impacts in coastal systems (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Marchante et al., 2003</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), where it replaces native herbaceous and shrub dune communities and proliferates under maritime pine forests. The long-term invasion by 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> has significant impacts on soil properties, altering its biological and chemical composition (
