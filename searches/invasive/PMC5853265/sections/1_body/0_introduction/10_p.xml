<p>Summarizing, the objectives of this work were to evaluate the use of UAV Remote Sensing imagery to: (a) detect and map the flowering of the invasive plant 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic>, and (b) test if there is a linear relationship between the flower cover detected by the UAV and the number of flowers of 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> measured in field. This is particularly important as this method is intended to be applied in the future to detect the effects of the BCA on the density of flowers, which is expected to decrease substantially in the future (
