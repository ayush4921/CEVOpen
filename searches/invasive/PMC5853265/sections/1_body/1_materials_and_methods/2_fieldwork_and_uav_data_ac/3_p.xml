 </sup> mounted, alternately, with one of two versions [regular RGB or filtered Colour-infrared (CIR)] of the Cannon IXUS/ ELPH, 16.0 MP, 6.16 mm Ã— 4.62 mm sensor. Since two different cameras were operated with the same UAV, it was necessary to perform two flights over the same area and therefore the RGB and CIR acquisition had on average 1 h of difference between them. All flights were performed between 100 and 160 m above ground altitude depending on the meteorological and local terrain conditions and this resulted in different resolution of the final products (
