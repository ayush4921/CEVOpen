<p>In each site, 30 areas of 50 m × 50 m were randomly selected for further field sampling which meant not all the pre-selected areas would have 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic>. Within each area with 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> presence, a minimum of three 1 m
 <sup>2</sup> quadrats were sampled for flowering counts (
 <bold>Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>
 </bold> and 
 <bold>Table 
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>
 </bold>). A minimum of 60 1 m
 <sup>2</sup> quadrat samples were collected in each study area (
 <bold>Table 
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>
 </bold>). Due to the extremely high number of flowers present in 1 m
 <sup>2</sup>, it was necessary to adapt the method of flower counting which would otherwise become unfeasible. So, within each quadrat, the flowers were counted in (at least) 3 smaller subplots of 30 cm × 30 cm (
 <bold>Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>
 </bold>). Also, only the number of flowers in the first 30 cm starting from the tip of the branch were considered. These subplots were chosen in order to be representative of the flowering within that 1 m
 <sup>2</sup> quadrat (
 <bold>Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>
 </bold>). The smaller 30 cm × 30 cm subplots were then extrapolated to number of flower per m
 <sup>2</sup>. This method was adapted from the methodology used by 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Morais and Freitas (2015)</xref> to provide an estimate of the number of flowers on a sampled area m
 <sup>2</sup>. In total, data on 408 m
 <sup>2</sup> were collected. Each quadrat was georeferenced in the SW corner and oriented toward NE. A Trimble GeoExplorer 6000
 <sup>®</sup> with post-processing differential correction was used to georeference the quadrat position to correctly match the field flower count sampling with the UAV observation.
