<p>In our study we followed the same approach used by 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Thorp and Dierig (2011)</xref>. In controlled conditions these authors collected digital photographs of a small patch (0.125 m
 <sup>2</sup>) of 
 <italic>Lesquerella fendleri</italic> (Gray) S. Wats and established a linear relationship between the area occupied by flowers in the photograph and the number of flowers present in the patch. We tested this method in the field for 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> and by using UAV imagery. 
 <italic>Acacia longifolia</italic> is structurally more complex than 
 <italic>L. fendleri</italic>; as previously mentioned, it is a shrub/small tree which produces flowers in different heights while the latter is an herb.
