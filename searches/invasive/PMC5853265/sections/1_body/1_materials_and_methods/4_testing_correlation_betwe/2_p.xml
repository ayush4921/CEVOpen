<p>To adapt the 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Thorp and Dierig (2011)</xref> method to imagery acquired by UAV we used the 1 m
 <sup>2</sup> quadrats positioned in the field (as shown in 
 <bold>Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>
 </bold>) to guide the extraction of the flower cover in that same location. This allowed the establishment of the linear regression between flower cover and number of flowers counted in the field. If this linear relationship between area of flower cover and number of flowers counted in the field is successfully established, then this method would allow mapping the number of flowers of 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> using UAVs using only the area covered by flowers.
