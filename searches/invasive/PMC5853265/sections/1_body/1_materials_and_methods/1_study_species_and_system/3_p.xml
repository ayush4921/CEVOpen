<p>The dunes of Quiaios (SD1 and SD2, 
 <bold>Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>
 </bold>) are a coastal strain of primary and secondary sand dunes with associated pine forests that extends inland. These sites are characterized by a mosaic of several well-established plant communities, including native perennial herbs (e.g., 
 <italic>Ammophila arenaria</italic> and 
 <italic>Corynephorus canescens</italic>) alternating with chamaephytic shrublands (e.g., 
 <italic>Corema album, Cistus salviifolius, Artemisia campestris</italic>). Between the different plants assemblages there are large areas dominated by invasive plant species (e.g., 
 <italic>Carpobrotus edulis, Arundo donax, Acacia saligna</italic>, and 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic>).
