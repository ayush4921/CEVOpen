 <italic>Acacia longifolia</italic> (Andrews) Willd. is easily identifiable both during the flowering season due to the bloom of yellow flowers as well as during the fruitification when its seed pods begin to brown and remain on the branches. It can develop as a shrub (often up to 4 m in height), when occurring in primary dunes, and as small tree (up to 8 m in height) when occurring more inland, also below the canopy of other species (e.g., maritime pines) (

 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> generally produces flowers throughout the broad terminal part of the branches (

 </bold>), it occasionally produces less flowers in the tip of the branches when in the primary dunes (
