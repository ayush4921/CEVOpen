<p>Tocha secondary sand dunes (SD3, 
 <bold>Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>
 </bold>) are characterized by a singular sand dune string conformation, perpendicular to the shore line. Like Quiaios dunes (SD1 and SD2) it is mainly dominated by diverse well adapted littoral plant communities (with 
 <italic>A. arenaria, C. album</italic> and 
 <italic>A. campestris</italic> as the most common species) alternating with areas dominated by alien plant species, such as 
 <italic>C. edulis</italic> and 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic>. SD3 burned in 1993 which triggered the expansion of 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic>, leading to the replacement of maritime pine stands by monospecific stands of 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic>. SÃ£o Jacinto (SD4) and Torreira (SD5) sand dunes are located further north and are characterized by primary dunes highly invaded by 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic>. SD4 shows maritime pines and large patches of invasion by 
 <italic>A. longifolia.</italic> In SD5 the maritime pines co-occur with secondary dune communities and are also mixed with invasive 
 <italic>Acacia dealbata</italic> and 
 <italic>Acacia melanoxylon</italic>. On the other hand, the pine forests of Quiaios (PF1 and PF2, 
 <bold>Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>
 </bold>) include sparse plantations of 
 <italic>Pinus pinaster</italic> with scattered patches of 
 <italic>Halimium halimifolium</italic> and 
 <italic>C. salviifolius</italic>. PF1 also has 
 <italic>Eucalyptus globulus</italic> plantations. Both PF1 and PF2 show a varying degree of invasion by different 
 <italic>Acacia</italic> species, including 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic>.
