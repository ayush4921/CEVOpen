<p>This study was carried out on seven sites distributed along ca. 80 km of the central-northern coast of Portugal (

 <italic>A. longifolia</italic>: (1) several plant communities in sand dunes (SD), including primary dunes, interdunes and secondary dunes (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Cesar de Sa et al., 2017</xref>); maritime pine occurs in these areas but generally does not dominate (SD1, SD2, SD3, SD4, SD5); and (2) pine forests plantations (hereafter pine forests, PF), where maritime pine dominates and 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> occurs in the understory (PF1, PF2).
