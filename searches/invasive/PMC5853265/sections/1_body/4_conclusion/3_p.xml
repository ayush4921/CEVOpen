 <italic>Acacia longifolia</italic> flower cover was not linearly correlated with the number of flowers, oppositely to 
 <italic>L. fendler</italic>i, indicating that there is a need to develop better methods to estimate 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> flowering. This lack of correlation is likely explained by variability of the structure and variability of 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> flowering. Considering the potential advantages that may come from the improvement of this approach in field conditions, future works should address these challenges and limitations opening a broader field of applications.
