<p>A successful low-cost approach was developed to map 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> flowering using UAV. Mapping of 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> flowering is the first step on establishing a method for monitoring the effect of the biocontrol agent 
 <italic>T. acaciaelongifoliae</italic>. And while we failed to establish a predictive relationship between area of flower cover and number of flowers, we believe that this method can be used for monitoring the expected decrease of the production of flowers.
