<p>Despite the challenges and limitations, our results showed that UAVs clearly offer a simple and reliable method to map the distribution of the invasive 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic>. Even if this approach is better suited when 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> is in the peak of flowering and occurs as an overstory species. While in the future it is expect that the biocontrol will significantly diminish the flowering intensity, this impact will increase gradually over time, therefore the near post-flowering period reflects the expected immediate impacts of the biocontrol.
