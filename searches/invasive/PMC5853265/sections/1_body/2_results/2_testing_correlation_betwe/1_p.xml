<p>The relationship between the number of flowers quantified during the fieldwork and the percentage of flower cover detected by the UAV was weak (

 </bold>). Lowest and non-significant correlations were observed in those areas where UAV flights occurred after the peak of flowering (SD4 and SD5) or where
