<p>Clear flowering distribution patterns of 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> were visible in images of all sites, showing specifically more presence of flowering in the dunes perpendicular to the shoreline (SD2 and SD3) (
 <bold>Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>
 </bold>) while SD1 did not have these types of dunes and also had more areas with pines. For the imagery acquired after the peak of flowering (SD4, SD5) the accuracy was lower than that of the best scenarios (0.973; 0.939 and 0.967; 0.896 respectively â€“

 </bold>). The flowering in these locations was harder to identify even during the extraction of the calibration/validation datasets (

 </bold>). While still within the flowering peak, it was possible to detect flowers on the edges of open areas of the pine forests (for example PF2 in
