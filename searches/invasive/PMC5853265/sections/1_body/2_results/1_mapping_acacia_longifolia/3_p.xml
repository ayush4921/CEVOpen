<p>The flower cover maps, i.e., the total area of flower per m
 <sup>2</sup>, showed that dunes perpendicular to the shoreline (SD2 and SD3) did have more flower cover (
 <bold>Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>
 </bold>). The post peak imagery (SD4 and SD5 
 <bold>Supplementary Figure 
  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM7">S7</xref>
 </bold>) showed less flowering intensity throughout the whole image (although very high rates of 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> are known to be present), with more cover observed in the East of the study area and farther from the coastline. In pine forests (PF2) higher cover of flowers were mostly visible in the open spaces where pine canopy did not cover 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> (
 <bold>Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>
 </bold>) but also still visible through the pine tree canopy.
