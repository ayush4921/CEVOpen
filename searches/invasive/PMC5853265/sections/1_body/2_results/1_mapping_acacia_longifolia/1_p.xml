<p>The Random Forest classification obtained very high accuracy when detecting presence of flowers of 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> (
 <bold>Table 
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>
 </bold>). The Overall Accuracy and Cohenâ€™s Kappa values were always higher than 0.95 and 0.85, respectively, which indicates that the color of the flowers was very well detected by UAV. The lowest Kappa values corresponded to the sites PF1 and PF2 where 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> invades as an understory species and the flower visibility was hindered both by total canopy cover as well as shadows. Considering the imagery acquired during the peak of flowering on dune systems (SD1, SD2, and SD3), SD2 and SD3 showed the highest Kappa values of all, while the OOB and the Overall Accuracy were very high for all locations. Blue band was the most important variable for all study areas except for SD2 (
 <bold>Supplementary Figure 
  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM10">S10</xref>
 </bold>) which can be indicative of the contribution the yellow flowering to the classification accuracy as yellow is a result of low blue value and a combination of red and green (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Sulik and Long, 2016</xref>). In opposition, the Near-Infrared band was the least important variable for all study areas except for P01 (

  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM10">S10</xref>
 </bold>) which can be indicative that this band is not helpful to distinguish yellow flowers from the background.
