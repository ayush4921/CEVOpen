<p>The analysis of the distributions of flower cover per m
 <sup>2</sup> in each site showed that all distributions were skewed, i.e., had an unbalanced distribution. In sites where flower detection was difficult, either because flowers were covered by pine canopy (PF1, PF2) or because images were acquired after the peak of flowering (SD4, SD5), the distribution was skewed toward the origin, reflecting lower values of flower cover per m
 <sup>2</sup> with less variability (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>
 </bold>). On the other hand, imagery obtained during the flowering peak period (SD1, SD2, SD3) showed not only higher average values of flower cover but also the highest variability which translates the high spatial variability of flowering patterns of the species (
