<p>The variation of phenology and structure of 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> added to the variability of the multiple habitats where the species occurs and this increased the challenge of quantifying the flowers by UAV-based imagery. 
 <italic>Acacia longifolia</italic> has a high structural variation as it can develop flowers along its branches, at different heights and overlapping (or not) each other, as confirmed during field measurements: e.g., dense groups of 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> trees with high numbers of branches and flowers overlapping each other several times vs. trees with dispersed flowers that rarely overlap; flowers at the top of the canopy which are hard to reach (small trees up to 8 m) vs. flowers at soil level that are easily quantified (shrubs lower than 2 m). This high level of variation occurred within the same trees as well as between different trees and was, most likely, the main factor that contributed to the low correlation found between the numbers of flowers measured in the field and those estimated using UAV imagery. Few works have tried to evaluate this type of relation.
