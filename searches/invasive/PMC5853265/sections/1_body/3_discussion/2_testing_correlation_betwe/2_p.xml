 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Thorp and Dierig (2011)</xref> provided a good example of the application of this methodology achieving much better correlation for 
 <italic>Lesquerella fendleri</italic> (
 <italic>Brassicaceae</italic>). However, 
 <italic>L. fendleri</italic> is an herb/forb which may produce all the flowers at approximately the same level; additionally, their experiment was conducted in highly controlled conditions with only one unique area of 1 m
 <sup>2</sup> being observed through time, which was not the case in our variable field conditions.
