<p>This research was one of the first attempts to quantify the number of flowers using UAVs and although this goal was not satisfactorily achieved, it brought valuable insights on the limitations and potentials of these systems. The quantification of flowers, fruits, galls and/or any other plant trait is of increasing importance to Remote Sensing of vegetation and thus, the use of low-cost UAV as well as new satellite observation platforms (e.g., Sentinel) deserve further exploration.</p>
