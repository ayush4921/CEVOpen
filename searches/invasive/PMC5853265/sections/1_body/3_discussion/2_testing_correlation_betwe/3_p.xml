<p>While our field measurements could potentially benefit from some re-design to better characterize what is in fact perceived by the UAV sensor and the inherent variability of 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> flowering which is probably the main cause of the observed lack of correlation. To address what is detected by the UAV we suggest that the quadrats should be marked on the field prior to the UAV flights to ensure that positioning errors from GNSS receiver are not responsible for the mismatch. Furthermore, the volume of 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> should be also considered by establishing allometric equations relating the volume with above ground biomass (
