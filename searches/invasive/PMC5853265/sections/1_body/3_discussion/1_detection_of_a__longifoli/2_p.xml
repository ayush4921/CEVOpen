<p>The use of UAV in the field of invasive alien plants has recently become more common (

 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Müllerová et al., 2017a</xref>). This technology can be a major contribution to monitor any phenomena that induces changes on plant phenology or morphology such as the spread of a forest pest (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Lehmann et al., 2015b</xref>) or the establishment of a biocontrol agent. In our study, 
 <italic>T. acaciaelongifoliae</italic> expansion is expected to reduce flowering (i.e., decrease quantity of flowers through space and time as it spreads from the release points) and vigor of 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Dennill, 1988</xref>), and as such a high resolution Remote Sensing protocol to monitor the plant flowering may be an excellent solution to be used as a proxy to monitor temporal and spatial impact of this biocontrol agent.
