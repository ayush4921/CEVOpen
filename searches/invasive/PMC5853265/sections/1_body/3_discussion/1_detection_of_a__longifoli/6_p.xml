<p>The flexibility in the acquisition of imagery with UAV allows capturing specific stages of phenology (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Müllerová et al., 2017b</xref>); in our study it allowed to capture the peak of flowering for most of the study areas. We observed that shadows can have very negative effects on imagery captured at high latitudes during the days of clear-sky. This happens due to the low altitude of sun on the local horizon even during the solar noon. Acquisitions during full cloud coverage significantly reduced the impact of shadows in our experiment, and did not have a meaningful impact on the high accuracy of the image classification exercise.
