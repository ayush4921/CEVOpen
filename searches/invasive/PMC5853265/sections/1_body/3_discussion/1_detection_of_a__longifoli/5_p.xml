<p>Accuracy of classification was dependent of flowering season and habitat type, showing better values during flowering peak and in sand dunes where 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> dominates the overstory. Even so, when flowers were hidden by pine canopy or when UAV flights occurred at the end of flowering season and less or senescent (weak yellow coloring) flowers were present, highly accurate values were still obtained. Using UAV technology to map below the canopy remains a challenge (

 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> flowering, confirming their plausible use as a proxy to detect the decrease in flower production due to the establishment of the biocontrol agent.
