<p>In studied sand dunes, as well as in other dune systems (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Elorza et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Rascher et al., 2011</xref>), 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> frequently replaces native plant communities where shrubs and herbs are more frequent, occupying large patchy areas and becoming dominant as an overstory species, and so is easier to detect. As expected (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Perroy et al., 2017</xref>), when 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> occurs in the understory of the pine forests, it is not detected by the UAV. Nevertheless, at the peak of flowering 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> visibility increased in the more open areas of the pine forest canopy.
