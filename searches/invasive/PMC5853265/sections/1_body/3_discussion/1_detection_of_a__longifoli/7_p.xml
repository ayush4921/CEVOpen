<p>In a broader perspective, the high accuracy in identifying 
 <italic>A. longifolia</italic> flowering confirms the potential for using UAVs to access phenological changes due to biota attack or any other factor that induce changes in plant phenology or morphology. This complies with other studies, e.g., that used satellite imagery to assess the impact of pine beetles (

Such studies highlight how UAV techniques can be flexible and applied in a wide range of study fields. Not only forestry, but also agriculture and environment, are increasingly evaluating Remote Sensing approaches for improving management efficiency (
