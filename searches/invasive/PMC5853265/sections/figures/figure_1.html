 <caption> Scheme of how the flower counting was performed in the field and examples of field data collection by the team. (A) The bottom left corner was georeferenced and the quadrat had one side oriented toward N and the other oriented toward east. (B–D) Show examples of data being collected in the field with the 1 m 2 quadrat. The variability of the flowering of this species is visible: (B) Sample collected in the interior dunes where the flowering extends throughout the whole branches of the plant. (C) In the frontal dunes where plants are smaller and flowering does not extend to the end of the branch and is instead “hidden” below the canopy of the plant. (D) Is a typical example of how A. longifolia morphologically adapts to the pine forest by growing in height as opposed to width and shows a decrease in flower productivity. </caption>
