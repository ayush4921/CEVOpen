  <p>Scheme of how the flower counting was performed in the field and examples of field data collection by the team. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> The bottom left corner was georeferenced and the quadrat had one side oriented toward N and the other oriented toward east. 
   <bold>(B–D)</bold> Show examples of data being collected in the field with the 1 m
   <sup>2</sup> quadrat. The variability of the flowering of this species is visible: 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Sample collected in the interior dunes where the flowering extends throughout the whole branches of the plant. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> In the frontal dunes where plants are smaller and flowering does not extend to the end of the branch and is instead “hidden” below the canopy of the plant. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Is a typical example of how 
   <italic>A. longifolia</italic> morphologically adapts to the pine forest by growing in height as opposed to width and shows a decrease in flower productivity.
