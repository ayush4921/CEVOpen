 <caption> Correlation coefficients between leaf carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorous (P) stoichiometric characteristics and soil characteristics (C, N, P stoichiometry, organic C, salinity). TC.L: total soil C content; TN.L: total N content of leaves; TP.L: total P content of leaves; C/N.L: leaf C/N ratio; C/P.L: leaf C/P ratio; N/P.L: leaf N/P ratio; SOC.S: soil organic C content; TC.S: soil total C content; TN.S: soil total N content; TP.S: soil total P content; S.S: soil salinity; C/N.S: soil C/N ratio; C/P.S: soil C/P ratio; N/P.S: soil N/P ratio; * indicates p &lt; 0.05, ** indicates p &lt; 0.01. </caption>
