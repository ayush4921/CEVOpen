 <caption> Soil eco-stoichiometry and the relationships between organic carbon ( C), salinity, and leaf eco-stoichiometry at different tidal levels. Blue and red arrows indicate the soil index and the plant index, respectively. Subfigures ( Aâ€“ C) represent the sample lines at the three tidal levels: 1, 3, and 5 km from the coastline (T1, T3, and T5, respectively); ( D) represents all sample points from three tidal levels. TC.L: soil total C content; TN.L: leaf total nitrogen (N) content; TP.L: leaf total phosphorus (P) content; C/N.L: leaf C/N ratio; C/P.L: leaf C/P ratio; N/P.L: leaf N/P ratio; SOC.S: soil organic C content; TC.S: soil total C content; TN.S: soil total N content; TP.S: total soil P content; S.S: soil salinity; C/N.S: soil C/N ratio; C/P.S: soil C/P ratio; N/P.S: soil N/P ratio. </caption>
