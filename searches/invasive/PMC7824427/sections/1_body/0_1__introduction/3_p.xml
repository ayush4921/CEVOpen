<p>Previous studies on the eco-stoichiometry of 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> have mainly focused on the response of plants to soil nutrients. For example, Xie et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-10-00013" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] found that the nutrient content of sediment increased in the early stage of invasion but decreased significantly in the later stage of invasion; however, Liao et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-10-00013" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] compared the decomposition of 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> litter and found that the C and N reserves increased. Some studies have shown that 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> invasion reduces soil nutrients [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-10-00013" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], but other studies have shown that 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> invasion has little effect on the soil properties and C and N storage [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-10-00013" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Undoubtedly, a feedback mechanism exists between plants and soil [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-10-00013" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Although forest plant-soil eco-stoichiometry has been relatively well studied in terrestrial ecosystems [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-00013" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-plants-10-00013" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], the relationship between the eco-stoichiometry of wetland invasive plants and the soil environment remain poorly understood. Therefore, we hypothesized that the nutrient utilization of 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> and the corresponding soil stoichiometric relationship between its leaves and the soil environment are important reasons for its successful invasion. This study is of great significance as it furthers our understanding of the nutrient balance and dynamic changes of coastal wetland systems.
