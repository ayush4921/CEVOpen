<p>The coastal wetland ecosystem is in the transitional zone between land and ocean and is one of the most diverse and valuable ecosystems in the world. With unique ecological processes, this ecosystem is functional in the maintenance of the coastline and its inhabitants, e.g., preventing coastal erosion, regulating climatic factors, purifying water quality, and providing habitats for organisms [

 <xref rid="B4-plants-10-00013" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Due to the fragility of this ecosystem, it is vulnerable to the threat of species invasion. 
 <italic>Spartina alterniflora</italic>, a species native to the Atlantic coasts of Canada and the United States, was introduced into China in the 1980s to help increase sediment accumulation and improve erosion resistance [
 <xref rid="B5-plants-10-00013" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. After nearly 40 years, 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> has occupied ~50,000 hectares of coastal wetlands from Hainan Province to Liaoning Province in China [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-10-00013" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The introduction of 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> has been shown to have numerous beneficial effects, e.g., providing a living space for crabs, effectively protecting the coastline of China, and reducing the impact of storms, and because its rhizomes have a good carbon (C) fixation effect. However, an increasing number of studies have shown that the invasion of 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> has had deleterious effects. For example, the continuous expansion of 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> has seriously threatened the survival of indigenous plants such as 
 <italic>Phragmites australis</italic>, 
 <italic>Suaeda salsa</italic>, and mangrove; has gradually reduced the 
 <italic>Ceratophyllum demersum</italic> community, which has adversely affected the wetland birds that depend on it for survival; and has affected the nutrient cycle of the ecosystem [
