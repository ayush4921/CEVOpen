<p>The invasion of alien plants impacts the environment, economy, society, and functioning of ecosystems and is one of the most important threats facing the global ecosystem [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-10-00013" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The successful invasion of alien plants involves many factors, including their own biological characteristics and non-biological environmental factors [

 <xref rid="B16-plants-10-00013" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-plants-10-00013" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the competition for habitat resources, invasive species often have better resource acquisition strategies than local plants. In resource-rich environments, invasive plants usually have a lower carbon (C) nutrition ratio and higher nitrogen (N)/phosphorus (P) ratios, while in resource-limited environments, invasive plants show higher C assimilation rates, N utilization rates, and energy-utilization efficiency [

 <xref rid="B20-plants-10-00013" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, the successful invasion of alien plants is often related to the conversion and utilization of C, N, and P. Ecological stoichiometry (hereafter “eco-stoichiometry”) mainly refers to the stoichiometric relationship of C, N, and P. Eco-stoichiometric investigations can reveal the theory of chemical transformation of nutrients and the nutrient regulation mechanism among the various components of the ecosystem and can help to increase our understanding of the responses of the plant body structure to nutrient elements and energy balance [

 <xref rid="B22-plants-10-00013" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. C, N, and P are important components of plant bodies, as well as the nutrient elements and restrictive elements for plant growth [

 <xref rid="B24-plants-10-00013" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], which are mainly exchanged between plants and the soil environment [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-10-00013" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The soil C/N and C, N, and P contents are important indicators of the soil organic matter composition and the stability of how the plant leaf C/N ratio and soil nutrients interact with and restrict each other [
 <xref rid="B26-plants-10-00013" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, eco-stoichiometry-based investigations of the coordination mechanism between plant and the soil environment can clarify the nutrient absorption mechanism of invasive species as well as the important factors that drive the dynamic nutrient balance in the environment.
