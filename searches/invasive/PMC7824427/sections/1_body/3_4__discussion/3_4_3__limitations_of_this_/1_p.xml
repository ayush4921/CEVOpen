<p>According to the Koerselman critical threshold theory, we conclude that 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> in this period is mainly restricted by N [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-10-00013" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], but due to the influence of climate characteristics, species types, and the invasion period and growth period of 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic>, this result has certain limitations. Research has shown that 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> is mainly restricted by N in the initial stage; along with its growth, the nitrogen fixation effect of 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> will reduce its dependence on nitrogen, its internal stability will change, and P may become a new limiting factor. In addition to its own nutrient utilization strategy, community environment leaves such as companion species also play an important role [

 <xref rid="B55-plants-10-00013" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In the study of Wang, the soil TC, TN, and TP contents were similar to those in this study, but the C/N was lower than in this study. There may have been two reasons for this: one is that his result is a combination of the results of multiple different regions, thus weakening those of the individual regions; another reason is that the plants in this study have a lower decomposition rate due to periodic flooding, resulting in a higher carbon–nitrogen ratio [

 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> in different growth stages, invasion periods, and habitats.
