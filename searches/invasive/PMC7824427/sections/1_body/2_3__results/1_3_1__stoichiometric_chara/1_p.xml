<p>The stoichiometry of C, N, and P of

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00013-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The TN.L, TP.L, and TC.L contents were the highest at T3 (3 km from the coastline) (16.79 ± 0.69 g/kg, 2.03 ± 0.06 g/kg, 371.90 ± 2.50 g/kg, respectively), intermediate at T1 (12.40 ± 0.18 g/kg, 1.65 ± 0.02 g/kg, 334.18 ± 4.71 g/kg, respectively), and lowest at T5 (11.28 ± 0.16 g/kg, 1.31 ± 0.04 g/kg, 326.93 ± 3.32 g/kg, respectively). All differences were significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), except for the TN.L contents between T1 and T5. The C/N.L and C/P.L levels were the highest at T5 (29.07 ± 0.32, 249.23 ± 7.58, respectively) and lowest at T3 (27.07 ± 0.47, 204.03 ± 3.75, respectively). All differences were significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The N/P.L content differed from the other indicators in that its maximum value was obtained at T5 (8.59 ± 0.28) and its lowest value was obtained at T1 (7.57 ± 0.15). The N/P.L value did not differ significantly between T3 and T5 (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Collectively, these results demonstrated that the C, N, and P stoichiometry of 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> leaves differed significantly between the different tidal levels.
