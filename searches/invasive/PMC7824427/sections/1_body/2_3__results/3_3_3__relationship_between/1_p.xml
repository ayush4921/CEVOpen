<p>The variation in TN, TP, TC, and C:N:P ratios of 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> were related to TC, TN, TP, and S.S content and C/P, N/P in soils but less related to the C/N.S (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00013-f004">Figure 4</xref>), and N/P.L was less related to the indicators of soils. There was a positive correlation between TC.L, TN.L, TP.L, and soil indicators (TC.S, TN.S, TP.S, SOC.S, S.S, C/P.S, and N/P.S) and a positive correlation between C.P.L and C.N.S. The C/N.L and C/P.L showed a significant negative correlation with SOC.S, TC.S, TP.S, TN.S, S.S, C/P.S, and N/P.S. In addition, the C/N.L showed a negative correlation with S.S (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00013-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Therefore, the TC, TN, and TP content of 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> leaves increased, but C/N.L and N/P.L ratios decreased with the increasing SOC, TC, TN, TP, C/P, and N/P in the soil.
