    "Carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus-nutrient and restrictive elements for plant growth and important components of the plant body-are mainly transferred and exchanged between plants and the soil environment. Changes in the carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus eco-stoichiometry greatly impact the growth and expansion of <i>Spartina alterniflora</i>, and understanding these changes can reveal the nutrient coordination mechanism among ecosystem components. To explore the relationship between leaf and soil eco-stoichiometry and determine the key soil factors that affect leaf eco-stoichiometry, we collected leaf and soil samples of <i>S. alterniflora</i> at different tidal levels (i.e., 1, 3, and 5 km away from the coastline) in a coastal wetland in the Yancheng Elk Nature Reserve, Jiangsu province. We measured the leaf and soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus contents and ratios, as well as the soil salinity and soil organic carbon. The results revealed the following. (1) The leaf stoichiometric characteristics and soil properties of <i>S. alterniflora</i> differed significantly between tidal levels; for example, total carbon, nitrogen, soil organic carbon were detected at their highest levels at 3 km and lowest levels at 5 km. (2) Significant correlations were detected between the leaf stoichiometric characteristics and soil characteristics. Additionally, nitrogen limitation was evident in the study area, as indicated by the nitrogen-phosphorus ratio being less than 14 and the soil nitrogen-phosphorus ratio being less than 1. (3) Soil salinity and the soil carbon-nitrogen ratio were shown to be the key factors that affect the eco-stoichiometric characteristics of <i>S. alterniflora</i>. These findings furthered our understanding of the nutrient distribution mechanisms and invasion strategy of <i>S. alterniflora</i> and can thus be used to guide <i>S. alterniflora</i> control policies formulated by government management departments in China."
