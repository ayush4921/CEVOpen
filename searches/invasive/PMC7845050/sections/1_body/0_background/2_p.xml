<p id="Par15">Excellent overviews of studies on the evolution of dispersal in plants and animals are given in Ronce [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and Duputié and Massol [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. For plants, a long line of research has developed on how (kin) competition, facilitation, inbreeding, and density dependent mortality translate to selective pressures for dispersal propensity (the tendency of an individual to disperse, e.g. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Increasing dispersal propensity, for example, can serve as an effective bet-hedging strategy to deal with spatiotemporal environmental variability [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Few studies to date included dispersal kernels in their evolutionary analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. These studies usually focus on a single aspect of dispersal (e.g., long-distance dispersal) or compare dispersal strategies in a relative sense (e.g., how dispersal propensity increases or decreases in response to stress-related factors). However, many of the driving processes act at different spatial scales [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], so that flexibility in the shape of dispersal kernels is required to balance trade-offs imposed by drivers that operate at a broad range of scales. Other moments of the dispersal kernel also play an important role in population dynamics, and define a dispersal strategy, as has been found in analytical and empirical studies in animal dispersal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].
