<p id="Par29">When the distribution of habitat is continuous in space (the most predictable scenario) or when the distribution of habitat is unpredictable, either in space (patch size = 1, i.e. patches can hold one individual only) or in time (patch turnover rate = 1), dispersal strategies dominated by long-distances were evolutionarily stable (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a-c). In these situations, dispersal strategies are driven exclusively by avoidance of kin competition (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d-f). Maximizing habitat encounter does not contribute to selecting better strategies, because habitat encounter is similar for all possible values of 
 <italic>μ</italic>; either because the landscape consists of continuous habitat, or because the habitat distribution is so unpredictable that no 
 <italic>μ</italic> optimizes habitat encounter better than another (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d-f).
