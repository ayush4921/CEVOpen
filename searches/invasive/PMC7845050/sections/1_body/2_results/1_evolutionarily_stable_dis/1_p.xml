<p id="Par27">Our simulations show that all types of dispersal strategies (ranging from strategies dominated by short-distance dispersal, to multi-scale dispersal, to long-distance dispersal) can be an ESS, depending on the spatiotemporal distribution of habitat in the landscape. The spatiotemporal distribution of habitat determines the optimal range of scales for dispersal following trade-offs in habitat encounter, kin avoidance and colonization. In general, we found that in the most static and in the most unpredictable landscapes, the two extremes (Moore nearest-neighbour dispersal and uniform dispersal, respectively) are ESS’s. When patch distributions are dynamic and fragmented, the trade-off results in a wide range of multi-scale dispersal strategies (including Lévy-like dispersal) that are tightly connected to the spatiotemporal habitat distribution.</p>
