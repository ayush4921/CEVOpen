<p id="Par31">The short-distance dominated dispersal strategies that we found to be ESS’s in static landscapes with small patch sizes (2–8) and large inter-patch distances (&gt; 50) changed immediately to multi-scale dispersal strategies when patch turnover rate was even slightly larger than zero. Under these conditions, winning the local competition within patches was no longer a stable strategy in the long term. Finally, no dispersal strategy could ensure population survival in some dynamic landscapes with large inter-patch distances. In these cases, the probability of seeds ending up in new habitat was too low to overcome the loss of habitat due to patch turnover.</p>
