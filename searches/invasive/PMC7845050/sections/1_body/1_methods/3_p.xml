<p id="Par23">We compared these 2D-Pareto kernels to ‘benchmark’ kernels or limiting cases on both ends of the spectrum: uniform dispersal across the entire domain (as benchmark for minimum 
 <italic>μ</italic>) and dispersal only to the eight nearest neighbours (Moore neighbourhood) in equal probabilities (as benchmark for maximum 
 <italic>μ</italic>). In each model-run, two plant types with different dispersal kernels competed in a landscape with specified fragmentation and patch turnover characteristics. Plants were initially randomly placed in equal proportions throughout a landscape. For simplicity, plants only produced seeds once per generation and then died (i.e., we simulated semelparous plants). Between generations, the types were redistributed over the landscape following four consecutive steps: 1) dispersal, 2) death, 3) patch turnover, and 4) colonization. The type that remained after multiple generations was assumed to have the better dispersal strategy. We then related these dispersal strategies to three important dispersal metrics that quantify the success of dispersal. A conceptual figure illustrating the model and model details are provided in Appendix
