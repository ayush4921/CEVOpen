<p id="Par26">We expected that, similar to random searches by animals, evolutionarily stable dispersal kernels would adequately balance a complex trade-off across a range of scales conditioned to the landscape configuration (habitat patch size, inter-patch distance and patch turnover). To facilitate interpretation of these trade-offs, we calculated three dispersal metrics that relate to the success of dispersal for each landscape configuration. First, we calculated the success rate of finding habitat (hereafter referred to as ‘habitat encounter’), as the fraction of seeds landing in suitable habitat. Second, we calculated the success rate of avoiding kin competition (hereafter ‘kin avoidance’). Grid cells close to parent plants typically receive a high quantity of seeds (&gt; 1), but only one individual can occupy a cell in the next time step. For each parent, we calculated kin competition using the following steps: I) We selected all grid cells where more than one seed arrived (remember here that we don’t have discrete seeds, so 1.5 seeds in a grid cell is also possible). II) We subtracted 1 seed from the values in these grid cells and summed all remaining (fractions of) seeds. III) We calculated the average number of superfluous seeds for all parents and then normalized the resulting value for the average number of grid cells where more than one seed arrived. Subsequently, we calculated kin avoidance as 1 - kin competition. Kin avoidance has a much stronger spatial signature than conspecific avoidance, which is why we selected this metric to analyse the evolution of dispersal patterns. Third, we determined the success rate of colonizing new patches (hereafter ‘colonization’) as the fraction of dispersed seeds landing in a new patch that emerged due to patch turnover.</p>
