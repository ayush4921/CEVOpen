<p id="Par36">The occurrence of multi-scale dispersal strategies in nature becomes particularly apparent in species that combine multiple dispersal vectors that transport seeds across different scales. For example, 
 <italic>Cakile maritima</italic> produces two different types of seeds that are either dispersed by water or as tumble weed attached to the maternal plant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. In other species, the same seed types are intended to be dispersed by different vectors, such as plants with seeds in fleshy fruits (dispersed by a range of animal species with varying dispersal capacities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>],) and wetland plants (dispersed by water or by waterbirds, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]). Investments in seed morphology to optimize dispersal come at widely varying costs [
