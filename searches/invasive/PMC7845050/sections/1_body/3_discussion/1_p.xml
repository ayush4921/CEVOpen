<p id="Par32">Studies of animal movement behaviour have identified general optimal movement strategies based upon the spatial distribution of resources [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. By borrowing intensive-extensive exploration trade-off concepts from animal movement ecology, we show that general optimal dispersal strategies can be identified for plants based purely on the shape of the entire seed dispersal kernel in relation to the spatiotemporal distribution of the plant habitat. Earlier studies have shown how dispersal propensity may evolve in response to landscape structure, cost of dispersal and other (density-dependent) processes [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Furthermore, studies have shown that other properties describing the shape of the dispersal kernel matter and can be adaptive in certain settings [

 <italic>entire shape of the dispersal kernel</italic> can be seen as a multi-scale search strategy that needs to balance incentives to disperse over short-distances, long distances and everything in between.
