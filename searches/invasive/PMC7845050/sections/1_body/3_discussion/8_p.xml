<p id="Par39">As a final point, we hope our framework facilitates plant ecological research to benefit from conceptual advances in animal movement ecology. Promising future directions for plant ecological research include exploring how different costs of dispersal (e.g. due to investments in traits) modify the optimal search strategy (cf. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]) and examining plant dispersal kernels for the existence of ‘composite walks’, which combine multiple movement types into one dispersal strategy, not necessarily showing scaling properties (cf. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]). The latter would be relevant in species with dispersal dimorphisms or species using multiple dispersal vectors, as discussed above. Another interesting direction would be to explore to what extent plant searches can be considered as ‘informed searches’. There is a growing body of evidence that plants dispersed by animals, water, and wind utilize ‘directed dispersal’ strategies, in which they use environmental cues or select specific vectors that result in disproportionate arrival of seeds at more suitable sites [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. In a recent study, ‘informed dispersal’ has been suggested as a strategy to escape competition and environmental stress [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Thus, future research could explore these strategies in the light of ‘informed searches’ in plants, similar to how animals use cues to guide their search towards suitable sites (cf. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]). Insights in how these factors shape the evolution of dispersal strategies, and progress in knowledge of dispersal mechanisms, can mutually inspire each other, and thereby improve the understanding and quantification of dispersal in plants.
