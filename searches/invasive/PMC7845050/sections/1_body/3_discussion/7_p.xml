<p id="Par38">By analysing seed dispersal as a plant search strategy for finding suitable habitat and using kernels with different scaling behaviour to compare dispersal strategies across different landscape dynamics, we break with the common practice of investigating dispersal propensity or focusing only on a single scale of plant dispersal kernels such as the tail or modal distance. With methodological hurdles to the study of long-distance dispersal being overcome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>], much research has focused on quantifying the tail of the dispersal kernel [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. This has resulted in rapid progress in our understanding of, and ability to predict, the connectivity of plant populations in fragmented landscapes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>] and has helped to explain species’ abilities to track climate change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>] or become invasive [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. At the same time, other studies have focused on the mode of the dispersal distribution to facilitate cross-species comparisons [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. The mode represents the distance where most seeds end up, which is a far easier measure and therefore an attractive parameter to study. We however stress that 
 <italic>the entire dispersal kernel</italic> (i.e. all the moments of the distribution) defines the movement strategy of plants, and as such is relevant for local, landscape-scale, and global species survival. Such an integrated approach to plant dispersal has also been advocated in the general ‘movement ecology paradigm’ [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>], and an important first step in making large cross-species comparisons of entire dispersal kernels has recently been taken [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The simplicity of our approach, which uses a flexible dispersal function parameterized by a single parameter, 
 <italic>μ</italic>, facilitates further comparisons across large numbers of species with widely differing dispersal strategies, while also allowing for the exploration of relations between species’ dispersal strategies and their traits, life history strategy, or habitat characteristics.
