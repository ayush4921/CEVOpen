<p id="Par35">Our analyses also lead to interesting untested hypotheses: species subjected to patchy environments should have multi-scale dispersal strategies that vary in the fatness of their tail in relation to patch size and inter-patch distances, but primarily in relation to patch turnover rates. This means that mid-range scales may become more or less prominent depending on habitat distribution characteristics. Analyses of measured plant dispersal kernels across real landscapes should reveal whether these hypotheses indeed reflect reality. It is, however, difficult to obtain complete dispersal kernels from field measurements, as long-distance dispersal events are extremely difficult to measure and at the same time form a vital component of the dispersal strategy. For wind dispersal, mechanistic models have been developed that simulate complete dispersal kernels (including long-distance dispersal events), and these have withstood tests against field tracking and trapping data (e.g., CELC , [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]; and WALD, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]). Simulations of tree dispersal kernels using WALD indicate that forest trees such as 
 <italic>Liriodendron tulipifera</italic> in oak-hickory forests, one of the largest and most continuous forest habitats in temperate regions, could have tails with power laws of 
 <italic>μ</italic> ~ 1.5 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]; species such as 
 <italic>Pinus taeda</italic> are likely to have even fatter tails [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. These kernels are close to the long-distance dominated dispersal kernels that would be expected for species in continuous habitats. Simulations of wind dispersal using the CELC model for herbs characteristic of patchy and temporary wet grasslands ( [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]; data from [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]) generate dispersal kernels that are best fitted by 2D-Pareto distributions with 
 <italic>μ</italic> ~ 2 (1.9 for 
 <italic>Cirsium dissectum</italic>, 2.0 for 
 <italic>Hypochaeris radicata</italic>). These values match the Lévy-like multi-scale dispersal kernels expected for species in successional, patchy habitats. For species typical of highly disturbed sites, such as 
 <italic>Tussilago farfara</italic> in disturbed open sites, extreme long-distance dispersal has been reported - up to 4000 m in one generation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], with a roughly estimated 
 <italic>μ</italic> of 0.59 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Another species typical of disturbed sites is 
 <italic>Cecropia obtusifolia</italic>, a pioneer tree colonizing forest gaps. Seed trap data of this species in young forests are best fit by a 2D-Pareto distribution with 
 <italic>μ</italic> = 1.1 (data from [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]). We summarize these first lines of evidence in Fig.
