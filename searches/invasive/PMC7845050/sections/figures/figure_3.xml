 <caption>
  <p>Upper panels (
   <bold>a-c</bold>): pairwise invasibility plots for dispersal strategies with different values of 
   <italic>μ</italic> (and the extreme cases of uniform and nearest-neighbour dispersal), highlighting the evolutionary stable strategy in red. Grey shading indicates the resident-invader combinations where the invasive type outcompetes the resident type in more situations than vice versa; a ‘+’ indicates that this happened in at least 11 out of 12 replicate runs. No convergence (‘0’) means that either no winner was identified after 1000 generations or no stable outcome was achieved (winning &lt; 11 out of 12 replicate runs). ‘X’ indicates extinction of both types. Lower panels (
   <bold>d-f</bold>): seed fates for dispersal strategies with different values of 
   <italic>μ</italic>, showing on the left y-axis the fractions of seeds that landed in suitable habitat (‘habitat encounter’, yellow line), and the fractions of seeds that avoided kin competition (‘kin avoidance’, blue line). On the right y-axis, the sum of both fractions (‘Combined’, red line) and optimal 
   <italic>μ</italic> are represented. IPD = Inter-patch distance, PS = patch size, PT = patch turnover rate
