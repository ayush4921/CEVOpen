 <caption> Formulae used in R to assess flammability in terms of the response variables in generalized linear mixed-effects models. R software version 3.6.1 (R Development Core Team 2019) was used. Response variables were burn intensity, completeness of burn and time-to-ignition. Predictor variables were (i) fire weather (ii) fuel moisture, (iii) fuel load, (iv) vegetation groups (IAPs, invasive alien plants; Fyn, fynbos; and Thi, thicket) and (v) species as random factor. Burn intensity, completeness of burn and time-to-ignition were run using generalized linear mixed-effects models (gaussian family and identity function) and spontaneous ignition (binomial family and logit link function) using lme4 package. </caption>
