<p>Fire weather significantly enhanced all measures of flammability, however the lack of response of live plant moisture contents to fire weather suggests that the mechanism through which fire weather enhances flammability may not be live fuel moisture. Other studies that have investigated fuel moistureâ€“flammability relations (
 <xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">Bianchi et al., 2018</xref>) have not evidently assessed the effects of fire weather or have manipulated fuel moisture through drying out of fuels beyond natural levels of fluctuation in live fuels (
 <xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">Dimitrakopoulos &amp; Papaioannou, 2001</xref>). We argue that the importance of live fuel moisture for flammability of evergreen shrublands rests on inter-specific and inter-vegetation type differences in fuel moisture contents (cf. 
 <xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">Chuvieco, Aguado &amp; Dimitrakopoulos, 2004</xref>), rather than medium-term intra-specific fluctuation in live fuel moisture in response to weather conditions. The incorporation of satellite-derived proxies for live fuel moisture into fire danger indices is therefore unlikely to be useful in these systems. Although fire weather increased all measures of flammability (and particularly ignitability), it was less influential than vegetation groups (see scaled estimates in 
 <xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The contribution of short-term weather conditions to the severity of the 2017 Knysna fires was regarded to have been secondary to that of the long-term drought preceding these fires that would have caused a buildup of dead fuels (
 <xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">Kraaij et al., 2018</xref>). Fire weather is expected to increase in importance in its effects on flammability if cognizance is taken of dry or dead fuels (see below) and when considering stand level fire behaviour. Although flammability experiments at the plant shoot scale are an improvement over those on excised leaves, and although results at the plant shoot and whole-plant scale are often in agreement (
 <xref rid="ref-59" ref-type="bibr">Pausas &amp; Moreira, 2012</xref>), the scale of experimentation relative to stand or landscape level fire remains inadequate. For instance, particular aspects of fire weather, such as wind speed, greatly influence wildfire spread and spotting behavior (
 <xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Forsyth et al., 2019</xref>). Such dynamics cannot be considered using the shoot-level flammability methods used in the current study; this may lead to an underestimation of the importance of fire weather on flammability and, by implication, fire behavior.
