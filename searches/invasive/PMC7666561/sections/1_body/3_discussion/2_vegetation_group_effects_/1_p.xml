<p>Vegetation group comparisons showed that the flammability of IAPs exceeded that of thicket in terms of all flammability measures and exceeded that of fynbos in terms of burn intensity. These findings support claims (

Fynbos and IAPs were more ignitable than thicket, and thus present higher risks under moderate and high fire weather conditions, whereas thicket presents lower risks under low and moderate fire weather conditions. Accordingly, observations from the 2017 Knysna fires indicated that thicket only becomes ignitable under very high or extreme fire weather conditions but may then burn at intensities exceeding that in fynbos but not that of IAPs (
 <xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">Kraaij et al., 2018</xref>) presumably on account of disparate fuel loads (

 <xref rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr">Mandle et al., 2011</xref>). In our study, there were no significant differences between the flammability of fynbos and IAPs but completeness of burn appeared to be the highest in fynbos. 
 <xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">Kraaij et al. (2018)</xref> also observed that fynbos burnt more completely than thicket and IAPs in the 2017 Knysna fires which suggests that the risk of recurring fire will be lowest in fynbos for some period post-fire, whereas incomplete burning of IAPs will not afford the same level of risk reduction shortly post-fire.
