<p>The primary aim of our study was to compare the flammability of live plant material amongst three vegetation groups—IAPs, fynbos, and thicket—and under varying fire weather conditions. Flammability measures considered were burn intensity, completeness of burn, and ignitability (time-to-ignition and likelihood of spontaneous ignition), while fuel traits considered were live fuel moisture and fuel load. A secondary aim was to assess the flammability of partially dried plant material as a crude proxy for drought effects, to ascertain whether drying of fuels (~drought) would differentially affect the flammability of the vegetation groups of interest. Study results will inform fire risk management in the southern Cape landscapes and elsewhere with similar fuel traits and characteristics.</p>
