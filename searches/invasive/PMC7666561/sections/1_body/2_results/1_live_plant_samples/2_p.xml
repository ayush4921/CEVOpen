<p>In considering vegetation groups, flammability was generally highest in IAPs, intermediate in fynbos, and lowest in thicket (
 <xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>). IAPs burnt at significantly higher intensity than fynbos and thicket. IAPs and fynbos showed significantly higher ignitability (shorter time-to-ignition and a greater likelihood of spontaneous ignition) than thicket.
