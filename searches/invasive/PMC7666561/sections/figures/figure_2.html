 <caption> The change (Δ) between live and dried samples in (A) fuel moisture, (B) burn intensity, (C) completeness of burn and (D) time-to-ignition, compared among vegetation groups. Live and dried samples were of the same species under comparable fire weather conditions. Vegetation groups were IAPs, invasive alien plants; Fyn, fynbos; and Thi, thicket. Medians (lines), 25–75 quantile ranges (boxes), 1.5 * interquartile ranges (whiskers), and outliers (dots) are shown. </caption>
