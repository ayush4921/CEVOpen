  <title>Predicted effects of fixed factors on the flammability measures, (A–D) burn intensity, (E–H) completeness of burn, (I–L) time-to-ignition, and the probability of (M–P) spontaneous ignition.</title>
  <p>Fixed factors were fire weather, fuel moisture, fuel load, and vegetation group (IAPs, invasive alien plants; Fyn, fynbos; and Thi, thicket). The effects shown here were based on the model outputs shown in
