<p>Here, the microcellulose obtained from 
 <italic>G. triacanthos</italic> pods is, to our knowledge, reported for the first time. The cellulose was extracted from 
 <italic>G. triacanthos</italic> pods and submitted to six cycles of delignification for purification. The extract from the 
 <italic>G. triacanthos</italic> leaves used for the functionalization of the cellulose microfibers had a content of TPC 113.62 ± 1.09 mg GAE/g dry plant, with the major compounds identified by UHPLC–DAD-ESI/MS being catechin (34,271.15 µg/L), chlorogenic acid (11,984.43 µg/L), quercetin (3007.89 µg/L), cinnamic acid (2736.42 µg/L), epicatechin (1431.47 µg/L), rutin (1302.31 µg/L), and vanillic acid (773.88 µg/L).
