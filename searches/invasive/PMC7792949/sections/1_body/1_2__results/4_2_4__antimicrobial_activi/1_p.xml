<p>The antimicrobial activity was performed by evaluating the viable cell counts (colony forming unit (CFU)/mL) and calculating the recovery factor initially and after 24 h. The data from 
 <xref rid="ijms-22-00033-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> show that the active principles released from the cellulose matrix positively influenced the antimicrobial effect both compared to the strain and CM control. The MFCM showed a better antimicrobial activity than CM for all strains except 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> ATCC DMS 13590 after 24 h of incubation at 37 Â°C.
