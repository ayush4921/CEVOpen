<p>The release kinetics of the active principles were evaluated by determining the TPC content by the Folin–Ciocalteu method and through monitoring the antioxidant activity over time. The process of releasing the phenolic compounds from the MFCM varied considerably in time (

 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9935), with a velocity of 3.1083 μg GAE/mL * h. The release of the phenolic compounds from the cellulose-based dressings was relatively short, reaching an almost complete release of the extract from MFCM within 120 h. A sudden release of a high concentration of TPC in PBS was observed after 2 h, with the rest being released in inverse proportion to the contact time. All experiments were performed in triplicate and the results have statistical significance (
