<p>Theoretically, the cellulose–PAs and cellulose–flavonoids bonds are the ester and ether ones, respectively, which were indeed highlighted at the wavenumbers 1338 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1260–1230 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. The bands specific to the ester groups were similar to those in the dry extract because PAs are found in the form of glycosidic esters according to Qian et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-ijms-22-00033" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. By comparing the FTIR spectra of CM, MFCM, and the dry extract, we identified four specific bands for MFCM that were not found in the other spectra, at the wavenumbers 779 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (aromatic C–H out-of-plane bending), 1338 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C–O stretching (phenyl), C–H (bending and CH
 <sub>2</sub>), 1442 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C–C stretching vibration in aromatic ring), and 1558 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C=C–C aromatic ring stretch) [
