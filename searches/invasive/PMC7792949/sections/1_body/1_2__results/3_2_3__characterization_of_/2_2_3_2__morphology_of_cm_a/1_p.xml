<p>SEM (scanning electron microscopy) analysis revealed that the control sample (CM) used for multi-functionalization with phenolic compounds showed the presence of microfibers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00033-f002">Figure 2</xref>) with diameters between 5 and 10 μm. The surface morphology of the CM sample indicated a relatively smooth surface, while that of the MFCM highlighted a rougher surface due to the adherence of the phenolic compounds. In the case of MFCM (impregnated with the extract from 
 <italic>G. triachantos</italic> leaves), it can be observed from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00033-f003">Figure 3</xref> that the chemical components specific to the extract adhered to the cellulose microfiber surface without requiring the presence of a fixing or crosslinking agent. These components (of MFCM) had a thickness between 40 and 120 nm and a length 0.2–1 μm.
