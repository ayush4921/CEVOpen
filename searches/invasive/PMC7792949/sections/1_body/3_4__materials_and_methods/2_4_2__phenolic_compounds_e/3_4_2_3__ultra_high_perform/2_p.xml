<p>Separations were performed on Kinetex (C18, 100 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm, Phenomenex, California, USA) column (reverse-phase UHPLC column) and a binary solvent system consisting of solvent A (water with 0.1% formic acid) and solvent B (methanol with 0.1% formic acid). The UHPLC gradient for mass screening, the flow rate, and the operation conditions of the mass spectrometer were previously optimized [
