<p>Static (equilibrium) CAs were measured using a drop shape analysis instrument, model DSA100 (Krüss GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). The samples were positioned on a plane stage, under the tip of a stainless-steel needle, with a blunt end, with an outer diameter of 0.5 mm. The needle was attached to a syringe controlled by DSA3 software supplied with the instrument and was used to drop water with a controlled volume on the test surface as well as to evaluate the contact angle. The volume of water droplets was ≈1 μL with a pumping rate of 5 μL/min. The tests were carried out at room temperature [
