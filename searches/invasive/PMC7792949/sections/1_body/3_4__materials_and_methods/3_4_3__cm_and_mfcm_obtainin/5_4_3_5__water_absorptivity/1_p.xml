<p>An amount of 0.1 g CM was treated with methanol and dried (60 °C for 24 h), then immersed in PBS (pH 7.4). The excess buffer was removed with filter paper and the material’s wet mass was determined using the method adapted after Ngadaonye (2013) [
 <xref rid="B36-ijms-22-00033" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The same procedure was applied to MFCM, while the percentage of absorbed water was calculated for CM and MFCM as follows: 
 <disp-formula>Swelling ratio (%) = (M
  <sub>2</sub> − M
  <sub>1</sub>) × 100/M
  <sub>1</sub>
 </disp-formula> where M
 <sub>1</sub> and M
 <sub>2</sub> represent the weights of dry and wet samples, respectively.
