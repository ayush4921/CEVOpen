<p>Cellulose extraction was performed according to Zhuo (2017) [
 <xref rid="B33-ijms-22-00033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Briefly, an amount of 30 g ground shells of 
 <italic>G. triacanthos</italic> was added over toluene/ethanol solution (2:1, 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) and the mixture was further refluxed for 8 h at 90 °C. Then, the biomass was treated with sodium hypochlorite under the acidic condition (glacial acetic acid) at 70 °C for 6 h to remove the lignin, followed by treatment with 2% NaOH aqueous solution at 90 °C for 2 h to remove most of the hemicellulose. After that, the samples were again treated by sodium hypochlorite under acidic condition for 2 h, followed by final purification of 2% NaOH solution at 90 °C for 2 h. After each cycle, the presence of lignin was evaluated by hydroxycinnamic acid content according to British Pharmacopoeia [
 <xref rid="B48-ijms-22-00033" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] using a calibration curve with commercial lignin solubilized in DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide) (λ = 524 nm, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9996). When lignin content was out of the detection limit, the cellulose was washed until it reached pH = 7.4, and each supernatant was evaluated by titration with AgNO
 <sub>3</sub>, indicating the removal of chloride ions. The cellulose fibers were divided into 2 samples, one being dispersed in 50% ethanol (control), and the second in the extract obtained previously. Both products were dispersed 3 times using IKA ULTRA-TURRAX (IKA®-Werke GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Staufen, Germany) for 10 min, followed by an ultrasound treatment for 60 min. Finally, the samples were lyophilized at −55 °C and 1 Pa to obtain the cellulose microfibers (CM) and the multi-functionalized cellulose microfibers (MFCM), respectively.
