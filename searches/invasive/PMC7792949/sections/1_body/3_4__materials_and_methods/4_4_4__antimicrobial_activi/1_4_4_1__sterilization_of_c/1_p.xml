<p>The samples were placed in an irradiation container. To measure the treatment doses, we placed dosimeters in the minimum dose positions (D min = 33.2 ± 1.6 kGy) and the maximum dose (D max = 35.7 ± 1.6 kGy). According to the dosimetry calculations performed, the minimum and maximum doses absorbed by the samples were within this range, with a confidence level of 95%. The dosimetry system used was Ethanol-Chlorobenzene (ECB). Gamma irradiation (Co-60) was performed with the SVST Co-60/B irradiator (Institute of Isotopes Co. Ltd. Budapest, Hungary) for 11 h 57 min at a dose ≥25 kGy. For sterility, verification/validation was performed at a concentration of 10% CM in peptone water and the doses were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After incubation, a volume of 0.1 mL was inoculated by being displayed on Trypton soy agar and Sabauroud agar in triplicates. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h for the enumeration of aerobic and mesophillic organisms and 7 days for fungi.</p>
