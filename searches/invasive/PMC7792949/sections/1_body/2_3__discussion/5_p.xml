<p>Microscopic characteristics, such as surface roughness, surface energy of materials, and thin surface coatings, play an important role in determining the wettability of material as well as hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity characteristics. The CM and MFCM highlighted a high wettability surface by CA measurements. The high wettability surface could be attributed to hydroxyl groups located at the equatorial positions of glucopyranose rings corresponding to higher planar orientation. [

The water absorption study is a gravimetric test that has the main purpose of determining the maximum amount of water absorption and retention expressed in percentages. This assay was designed to determine how a dressing manifests its properties in conditions as close as possible to what can happen on the surface of a wound. In essence, the weight gain of the dressing after the absorption of the liquid and its swelling over a certain period of time was measured and used as an indication of water absorption and retention. MFCM had better water retention properties than CM, possibly due to the presence of phenolic compounds and glycosides. In general, these compounds increased the rate of hydration, which represents an advantage for wound dressing materials.
