<p>There are many studies that have tried to establish some correlations between the antioxidant and antimicrobial activity, but only a few involved clinical strains isolated from hospital-acquired wound infections, such as 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, although the results were, however, contradictory [
 <xref rid="B30-ijms-22-00033" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. MRSA and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> seem to be sensitive to cinnamic acid [
 <xref rid="B40-ijms-22-00033" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], p-coumaric acid [
 <xref rid="B41-ijms-22-00033" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-ijms-22-00033" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], caffeic acid, vanillic acid, protocatechuic acid [
 <xref rid="B41-ijms-22-00033" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-ijms-22-00033" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], while ferulic acid was effective only against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B43-ijms-22-00033" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. On the contrary, in other studies, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was not sensitive to p-coumaric acid, vanillic acid, or proocatechuic acid [
 <xref rid="B44-ijms-22-00033" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The MFCM proved to be more active on Gram-negative strains. Previous studies have shown only a minimal link between the antioxidant activity and antimicrobial efficacy [
 <xref rid="B30-ijms-22-00033" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In addition, the CM and MFCM are biocompatible materials with high cell proliferation rates and low cytotoxicity on mouse murine fibroblast cells.
