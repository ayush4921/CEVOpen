 <caption> Differentially expressed/abundant plant cell wall degrading enzymes in the two species. ( A) Barplot showing number, and dots showing the percentage of differentially expressed PCWDEs in the two species in MvsNIM (top) and RvsNIR (bottom) in transcriptomics data. ( B) Barplot showing the number, and dots showing the percentage of differentially abundant PCWDEs in the two species in MvsNIM (top) and RvsNIR (bottom) in proteomics data. CAZYmes classified on the basis of their substrate in the plant cell wall ( Supplementary Table S6) showing the number of genes upregulated/increased abundance (orange) and downregulated/decrease (blue-green) in the two species. </caption>
