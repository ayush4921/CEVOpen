 <caption> Response towards spruce roots by the mycelia (MvsNIM) of A. ostoyae and A. cepistipes. ( A) logFC differences of co-orthologs DEG (top) and DAP (bottom) in both species. For proteomics, only genes for which a fold change could be calculated are shown (43 out of 89 orthologs). ( B) Venn diagram showing species-specific and common DEGs in A. ostoyae and A. cepistipes. Green and red arrows correspond to upregulated and downregulated genes, respectively. Heatmap below shows 779 co-orthologs with similar expression patterns (upregulated/downregulated in both species) out of the 875 common DEGs. Towards right are the top 20 upregulated proteins (red) in the two species, sorted by decreasing logFC in A. ostoyae. ( C) Venn diagram showing species-specific and common DAPs in A. ostoyae and A. cepistipes. Green and red arrows correspond to proteins with increased and decreased abundance, respectively. Heatmap below shows 134 co-orthologs with similar abundance (increased/decreased in both species) out of the 152 common DAPs. Towards right are the top 20 proteins with increased abundance in the two species, sorted by decreasing logFC in A. ostoyae. </caption>
