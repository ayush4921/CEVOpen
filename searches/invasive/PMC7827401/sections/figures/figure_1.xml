  <p>Overview of the experimental approach for root decay studies. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Representation of 
   <italic>Armillaria ostoyae</italic> (pathogenic) and 
   <italic>A. cepistipes</italic> (saprotroph) used in this study, (
   <bold>B</bold>) The four tissue types sampled for transcriptomics and proteomics analysis, viz., invasive mycelium (growing beneath the outer layer of root), invasive rhizomorphs (emerging out of the roots), non-invasive mycelium and non-invasive rhizomorphs (growing in absence of root). 
   <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> is shown as an example, (
   <bold>C</bold>) Multidimensional scaling of three biological replicates from each of the tissue types in 
   <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> for proteomics (left) and transcriptomics (right), (
   <bold>D</bold>) Proportion of transcripts and proteins detected in the two -omics analysis. The blue circle represents the whole proteome, orange depicts the transcripts detected in the RNASeq, and green represents the proteins detected in the proteomics analyses. (
   <bold>E</bold>) The number of differentially expressed genes (blue) and differentially abundant proteins (orange) detected in the two species.
