<p>Proteomic results were analysed using Perseus (v 1.5.4.0) [
 <xref rid="B40-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed to determine the relative changes in protein abundance. Quantitative analysis was performed using a student’s t-test with a 
 <italic>p</italic>-value cut-off of 0.05 and log
 <sub>2</sub>(fold change; FC) ≥ 1. Qualitative analysis revealed proteins that were detected in 2/3 replicates for a sample type and undetectable in all replicates of the comparator group. A theoretical minimum fold change was determined for qualitative results based on a calculated minimum detectable protein intensity (mean + 2 standard deviations of lowest detectable protein intensity for each replicate in the experiment) [
 <xref rid="B34-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Based on this theoretical minimum fold change, some qualitative results were excluded due to intensity values approaching the minimum detectable levels. Qualitative and quantitative results were combined, and a total number of differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) are summarized in
