<p>The CAZyme copy numbers in 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic> were collected from the JGI Mycocosm annotations, which are based on the CAZy annotation pipeline [
 <xref rid="B44-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. We separated the CAZy families based on their substrate-specificity (
