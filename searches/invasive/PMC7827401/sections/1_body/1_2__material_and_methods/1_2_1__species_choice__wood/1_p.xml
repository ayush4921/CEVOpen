 <italic>Armillaria ostoyae</italic> is a pathogen while 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic> is a saprotroph with a mortality ratio not exceeding 5% [

 <xref rid="B33-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Both of them preferentially colonize conifers [

 <italic>Armillaria ostoyae</italic> C18 and 
 <italic>Armillaria cepistipes</italic> B2 [
 <xref rid="B17-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] were inoculated on Malt extract agar (MEA) and incubated at 25 °C in dark for a week. Next, 4–5 cm long, autoclave sterilized spruce (
 <italic>Picea abies</italic>) roots were introduced to the week-old cultures and were kept at 25 °C in the dark until the roots were completely colonized by mycelial sheath and rhizomorphs were growing out of the it. Sampling was performed at the time when rhizomorphs were seen emerging out of the roots (2–3 weeks) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-09-00149-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). After colonization, roots were dissected to collect mycelium and rhizomorphs emerging out of the colonized wood (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-09-00149-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). Cultures of 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> without the addition of spruce roots were used as controls. The tissues were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80 °C till further use. Total RNA was extracted in three biological replicates by homogenizing the tissues using mortar and pestle, followed by processing samples using the Quick-RNA Miniprep kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA), following the manufacturer’s protocol.
