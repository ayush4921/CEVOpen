<p>Mycelia of 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic> responded similarly to wood, with 713 orthologous genes showing differential expression in both species. These include many plant cell wall degrading enzyme genes, hydrophobins, CBM67s, cytochrome p450s, transcription factors, and iron acquisition-related genes, among others. Pectinolytic PCWDE genes were dominant among CAZymes, followed by expansins, and cellulose- and hemicellulose degrading enzyme genes, whereas lignin-degrading PCWDE-s were mostly downregulated in our assay. The proportionately high number of pectin-related PCWDE-s mirrors comparative genomic observations that revealed enrichment of pectinolytic genes (in particular CBM67s) and expansins, but depletion of LDE encoding genes in 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> genomes [
 <xref rid="B17-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Of particular interest are CBM67-s, which comprised 4 of the top 20 most induced co-orthologous genes in both species. There was a similar percentage of upregulated pectinolytic genes in the mycelium of 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic> (ca. 38%) as in other studies examining early-phase decay (48% in 
 <italic>Pycnoporus coccineus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B95-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>] and 45% in 
 <italic>Postia placenta</italic> [
 <xref rid="B67-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]), whereas the percentage was lower in 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> (17%). LDE encoding genes (AA1, AA2, and AA5), on the other hand, were underrepresented among DEGs/DAPs, consistent with their general underrepresentation in 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> genomes. This aligns well with previous reports of the limited lignin-degrading capacity of 
 <italic>Armillaria</italic> spp. [
