<p>Sterilized Norway spruce roots were introduced to one-week-old cultures of 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic>. We observed abundant growth of the mycelium in and under the bark layer (

 <xref rid="B49-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], we did not find evidence for the mechanical entry of rhizomorphs into the bark. Instead, upon contact with the root, rhizomorphs switch to hyphal growth (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-09-00149">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref>). Rhizomorphs were not observed below the bark in 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> even after eight weeks of incubation (roots were completely colonized by the fungus by four weeks, growth rate of 
 <italic>Armillaria mellea</italic> mycelium is around 0.75 mm/day [
 <xref rid="B50-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]), whereas 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic> grew rhizomorph-like structures below the bark layer (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-09-00149">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>). Both species exited the root section as rhizomorphs. These observations suggest that mycelium is the primary colonizing structure of wood, which is consistent with the higher surface/volume ratio of hyphae being better suited for nutrient acquisition as compared to rhizomorphs. Rhizomorphs probably emerge much later, possibly to transfer nutrients, as seen commonly under the bark of decayed logs [
