<p>We observed similar patterns in the proteomic data: there were more enriched GO terms in 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic> than 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic>. In 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic>, we found 18 and 12 significantly enriched terms in M
 <italic>vs</italic>NIM and R
 <italic>vs</italic>NIR, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-09-00149-f002">Figure 2</xref>B), whereas, in 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic>, there were 35 significantly enriched terms in M
 <italic>vs</italic>NIM and 19 in R
 <italic>vs</italic>NIR (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-09-00149">Supplementary Figure S4B</xref>). Terms enriched in M
 <italic>vs</italic>NIM included pectinesterase activity, polygalacturonase activity, cellulose-binding, carbohydrate-binding, hydrolase activity, together with cell wall modification, cell wall-related terms, and sugar metabolic process.
