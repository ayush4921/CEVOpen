<p>In 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> we found 987 and 35 significantly upregulated genes (log
 <sub>2</sub>FC &gt; 1, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) in invasive vs. non-invasive mycelium (M
 <italic>vs</italic>NIM) and in invasive vs. non-invasive rhizomorphs (R
 <italic>vs</italic>NIR) (5.74% and 0.2% of transcriptome), respectively. Considerably more, 2108 and 327 upregulated genes were found to be differentially expressed in M
 <italic>vs</italic>NIM and R
 <italic>vs</italic>NIR in 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic>, respectively (13.29% and 2.06% of transcriptome; 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-09-00149">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). The number of differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in the proteomics analysis was lower: we detected 279 and 108 proteins with increased abundance in MvsNIM and RvsNIR in 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> (8.78 and 3.40 % of detected proteome), and 439 and 282 proteins with increased abundance in MvsNIM and RvsNIR, respectively, in
