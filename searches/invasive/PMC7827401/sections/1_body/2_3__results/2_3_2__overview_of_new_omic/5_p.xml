<p>We found considerably more DEGs/DAPs in the mycelium than in rhizomorphs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-09-00149-f001">Figure 1</xref>E) in both species, which indicates that the mycelium is more actively involved in the colonization of woody tissues than are rhizomorphs. A more surprising observation is that the saprotrophic 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic> shows a higher number of DEGs/DAPs than the pathogenic 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-09-00149-f001">Figure 1</xref>E). To confirm that this is not a result of higher baseline expression of some genes in 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic>, we compared the distribution of raw expression values of co-orthologs in the M and NIM samples in both species (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-09-00149">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). This showed that baseline expression of genes in non-invasive mycelia of 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> was not higher than that in 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic>, indicating that the higher number of DEGs in 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic> is indeed the result of the stronger reaction of this species to wood. We speculate that this is because saprotrophs, to gain a competitive advantage over other microbes, have to colonize/degrade wood faster than necrotrophic pathogens, such as 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic>, which can both feed on living parts of the tree and, upon killing the host, can be the first colonizers of the wood [
