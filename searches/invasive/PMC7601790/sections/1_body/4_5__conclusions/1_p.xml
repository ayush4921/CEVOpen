<p>The success of 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> as an invasive species in different habitats of arid regions seems to be related to the ability of this species to adjust its functional traits in accordance with habitat variations. The present data revealed more 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> vigor in the habitat with high resource availability, which supports the resource fluctuation hypothesis. Additionally, water availability could be a factor for the vegetative flourishing of 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> in wadi channel habitats. In addition, the invasion of 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> seems to be more aggressive in the disturbed areas, thereby control of this invasive plant should start in the abandoned fields and the cultivated areas. Finally, the restoration of the disturbed habitats could be helpful in the control of this noxious weed.
