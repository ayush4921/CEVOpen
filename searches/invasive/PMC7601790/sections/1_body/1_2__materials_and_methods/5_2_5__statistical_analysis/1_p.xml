<p>One-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used to examine the significant difference among the different habitats (
 <italic>n = 7</italic>) regarding the soil properties as well as the functional traits of 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic>. SPSS software (Version 24.0; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used to perform statistical analysis. Two data matrices of different functional traits, as well as the soil variables within the studied habitats, were prepared. According to the approach proposed by Legendre and Legendre [
 <xref rid="B46-plants-09-01268" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], the data of the vegetative and reproductive traits from the seven habitats were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA), to generate a synthetic representation of the habitats and the functional traits. The functional traits were plotted as loading vectors in the bi-plot, while the habitats were plotted as observations. The relationships between the soil variables, habitats, and functional traits were assessed by ordination analysis using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Additionally, the agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) and heatmap were performed based on the data of soil variables as well as the functional traits of 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> populations within the seven studied habitats. The AHC was performed based on the Pearson correlation coefficient and weighted pair-group average agglomeration method. PCA and AHC were performed using XLSTAT software program (version 2018, Addinsoft, NY, USA), while CCA was produced using the MVSP software program, ver. 3.1 [
