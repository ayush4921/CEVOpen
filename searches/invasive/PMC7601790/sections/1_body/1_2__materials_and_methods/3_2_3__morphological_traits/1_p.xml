<p>For each selected plot in each habitat, at the end of the flowering–fruiting stage, we recorded the morphological traits of 15 individuals of 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> related to shoot density for shoot height from the ground, shoot canopy diameter (based on 2–3 measurements/individual), and the number of secondary and tertiary ramifications, i.e., 1050 individuals were screened (15 individuals per plot × 10 plots per habitats × 7 habitats). After these measurements, 15 mature and healthy individuals were excavated and brought to the laboratory in an ice-cool box. Roots were manually washed and their length and dry mass were measured for each individual. Leaf area (one-sided projected area) was measured on the fresh longest full-grown leaves of each individual using a portable laser leaf area meter CI-202 scanning planimeter (CID Inc, Camas, WA, USA). Plants were separated into roots, stems, and leaves and dried at 70 °C for 48 h. Based on these measurements, the specific leaf area (SLA) was determined as the ratio of leaf area to leaf dry mass. Leaf dry matter content (LDMC) was determined as the ratio of leaf dry mass to saturated fresh mass. Leaf thickness was estimated from the ratio SLA × LDMC
 <sup>−1</sup> as described by Vile, et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-09-01268" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. These functional traits were selected according to Pérez-Harguindeguy, et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-09-01268" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], to assess the response and plasticity of 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> to the environmental factors within different habitats
