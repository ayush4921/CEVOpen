<p>Ramification, vegetative height, and canopy diameter are positively correlated to each other. On the other side, the reproductive traits: flowers/individual, fruits/individual, and seeds/individual are very closely correlated to each other. However, the leaf thickness is negatively correlated with the specific leaf area. It was evident from the data of PCA that the wadi channels habitat showed a positive significant correlation to the leaf area and leaf dry mass. On the other side, the habitat of abandoned fields showed a highly close correlation to the specific leaf area and the fruit dry mass. The wetland habitat revealed a close correlation to the leaf thickness, while the habitats of cultivated fields and roadside are overlapped and did not show a clear correlation with the functional traits. Specifically, they showed a slight correlation with fruit dry matter and the specific leaf area. Finally, the mountain ranges and sandy plains habitats are segregated together on the left part of the PCA plot and did not show a specific correlation to any trait. </p>
