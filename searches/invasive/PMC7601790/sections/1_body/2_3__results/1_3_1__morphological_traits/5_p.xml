<p>Allocation to roots was slightly greater in abandoned fields compared to the other habitats (

 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic>, where the population growing in the wadi channels and mountain ranges habitats had the highest allocation in the vegetative dry weight. The allocation to vegetative organs was significantly smaller in abandoned field populations. It was remarkable that allocation to vegetative organs of 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> populations in the wadi channels habitat was 4.5-fold higher than the abandoned fields habitat. The allocation in the reproductive organ (fruit) was smaller in the population growing in wadi channels and wetlands habitats, while the other habitats did not show significant difference among each other at
