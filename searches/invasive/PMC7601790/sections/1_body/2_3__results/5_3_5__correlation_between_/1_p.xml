<p>Pearsonâ€™s correlation heatmap between the soil variables and the different functional traits of 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> within seven habitats are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-09-01268">Figure S1</xref>. It was remarkable that most of the vegetative and reproductive traits were negatively correlated with sand, pH, and available nitrogen. The height, canopy diameter, ramification, root traits, and reproductive traits were positively correlated with EC, OM, elements, SO
 <sub>4</sub>, and total N, however, these traits were negatively correlated with sand, pH, and available P. On the other hand, the leaf traits showed a reverse manner, and interestingly, the leaf thickness showed a negative correlation to all soil variables except sand fraction. Regarding the biomass allocation, root and reproductive organs allocations revealed negative correlations with all soil variables, while the vegetative organ allocation showed positive correlations with all soil variables except for sand content and pH (
