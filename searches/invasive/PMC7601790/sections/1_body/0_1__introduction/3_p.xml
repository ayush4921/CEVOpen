<p>Alternatively, reproductive traits of invasive species change due to variations in ecological conditions and biophysical constraints within different habitats [

 <xref rid="B18-plants-09-01268" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Invasive species may be found at higher densities and with higher reproductive rates in some habitats than others [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-09-01268" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Habitats with increased resources tend to be more productive for invasive species with higher reproductive output and higher rates of spread [
