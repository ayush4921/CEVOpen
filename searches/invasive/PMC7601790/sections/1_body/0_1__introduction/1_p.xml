<p>Invasive alien plants have become a serious threat to native plant diversity and ecosystem function in many regions of the world [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-09-01268" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A major challenge for plant ecologists is to highlight how invasive species respond to the variation in environmental conditions [

 <xref rid="B3-plants-09-01268" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Successful invaders often demonstrate high levels of plasticity that allow them to succeed in a wide range of habitats [

 <xref rid="B7-plants-09-01268" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Thus, comparing the relative performance of potential invaders in different habitats may help in understanding their strategies and mechanisms that could guide their control and management, especially in the fragile ecosystems [
