<p>Arid environments are considered as the ecosystems least affected by biological invasions [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-09-01268" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, in recent years, many invasive species have predominantly invaded managed and/or disturbed areas, such as agricultural fields and roadsides [

 <xref rid="B26-plants-09-01268" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Furthermore, some of these species have escaped to many natural habitats including wetlands, rangelands, and biodiversity hotspots, and can generate significant negative impacts on ecosystem processes and functions [

 <xref rid="B27-plants-09-01268" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-plants-09-01268" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Given the wide expansion of many invasive species across a range of desert habitats, more studies are required on their morphological and reproductive attributes that promote their spreading and invasion success.
