<p>In this context, the wadi channels habitat attained the highest vegetative allocation compared to the other habitats. This could be ascribed to the soil moisture factor, where this habitat is characterized by occasional water flowing along the wadi continuum which allows the plant to allocate more biomass toward shoots. Although the root allocation is affected more strongly by variation in soil nutrients [

 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> in abandoned fields was responding to combined stressful conditions; possibly salinity and anthropogenic stresses rather than to a resource limitation [
