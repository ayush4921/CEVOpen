<p>In the present study, the wadi channels habitat had the highest values of most of the shoot parameters, i.e., vegetative height, canopy diameter, number of secondary ramifications, leaf area, leaf dry mass. On the other hand, the population of the abandoned fields habitat attained the highest values of all measured root and reproductive traits (
