<p>The present study revealed significant variations in all determined vegetative and reproductive traits among the habitats. These data reflect the plasticity of

 <xref rid="B23-plants-09-01268" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] revealed that invasive species have higher phenotypic plasticity than native species, while the fitness of the non-invasive species becomes better under resource limitation. The ability to tolerate stressful conditions and to capture and utilize available resources may provide invasive species a widespread distribution and high growth rate. Additionally, several studies showed the trait plasticity of invasive species in different ecosystems [
