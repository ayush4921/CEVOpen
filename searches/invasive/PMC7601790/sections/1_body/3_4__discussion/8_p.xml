<p>In a comparison of the seven habitat types invaded by 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic>, we noticed that the population of abandoned fields had an increased root depth and biomass allocation, as well as increased SLA and thinner leaves. Such combinations of root and leaf traits may allow 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> to exploit enriched soil resources in abandoned fields. These traits are typically found in fast-growing species that invade nutrient-rich sites, making them more efficient for nutrient capture [
