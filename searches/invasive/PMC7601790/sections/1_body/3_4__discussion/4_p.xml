<p>The vigorous vegetative growth of 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> in wadi channels and abandoned fields compared to the drier habitats, such as sandy plains and mountain ranges, could result from enhanced soil water availability and nutrients. In arid and semi-arid regions, soil water availability, especially water pulses in streams, largely determines the growth and productivity of plant communities [
