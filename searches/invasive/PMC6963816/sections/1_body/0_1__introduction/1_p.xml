<p>Biological invasion is considered to be one of the largest threats to native biodiversity [

 <xref rid="B3-plants-08-00593" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Increasing eradication efforts have to be made to keep up with the growing rate of introduction and establishment of alien species [
 <xref rid="B4-plants-08-00593" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Because of limited financial resources, global strategies need to identify and implement optimal management procedures against the spread of invasive species [
 <xref rid="B5-plants-08-00593" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Previous studies emphasize that prevention and early detection with rapid response are the most efficient ways to combat invasion [
 <xref rid="B2-plants-08-00593" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-plants-08-00593" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Beside early detection, the monitoring of existing populations of invasive species is also part of an effective invasion control strategy [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-08-00593" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Early detection should be based on a system of regular surveys to find newly established populations [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-08-00593" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; however, most of these studies lack European and national scales [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-08-00593" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Applicable methods to detect species may differ between taxonomic groups, population size, and environmental settings [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-08-00593" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Remote sensing data, including aerial photographs and satellite images, have been widely used to map invaders; however, they are most effective for species appearing in and dominating the canopy of the ecosystem [
 <xref rid="B4-plants-08-00593" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and when the population size is rather high [
