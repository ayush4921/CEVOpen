<p>Conspicuous, easily identifiable alien plant species may be detected by the use of field photographs. However, field photos are usually taken by different individuals in an unrepresentative way in space and time, or with small spatial coverage. Statistical Office of the European Communities (EUROSTAT) has been carrying out the Land Use and Coverage Area Frame Survey (LUCAS) every three years since 2006, in order to identify the actual status and changes in land use and cover in the European Union (EU) [

This survey was established for the validation of the Coordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE) land cover (CLC) databaseâ€”therefore, it is carried out in situ. LUCAS points belong to the intersections of a 2 km grid that includes around 1 million points all over the EU. As part of the LUCAS procedure, field images are taken at the survey points that can be used for assessing the presence of invasive species. The density and the spatial extent of the survey points allows for the systematic assessment of invasive species presence at regional, national, and EU-wide spatial scales [
