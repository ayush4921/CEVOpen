<p>Common milkweed was introduced into Europe in 1629 [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-08-00593" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In the invaded range, the species occurs mainly in ruderal habitats, road verges [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-08-00593" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], abandoned fields, and tree plantations [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-08-00593" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The study of its ecological effects has been gaining importance given its range expansion in recent decades. Invasion of common milkweed has been linked with decreased levels of native plant species cover [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-08-00593" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], shifts of maximum vegetation compositional diversity to larger spatial scales in sand grasslands [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-08-00593" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and lower levels of the functional diversity of spiders [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-08-00593" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] in invaded ecosystems. In contrast, Jurová et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-plants-08-00593" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] did not find any negative effects of common milkweed in soil nematode community, while Szitár et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-08-00593" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] showed positive effects of common milkweed on native grass survival during summer drought.
