<p>The sample area has a humid continental climate, with an average annual temperature of 10.5 °C and an average annual precipitation of 550 mm. Agriculture is facing major challenges as a result of its more and more arid climate, which is characterized by diminishing summer rainfall, increasing drought frequency, and the significant decline in groundwater level (up to 6–8 m in some areas) since 1970 [

The abandonment of arable land was most significant in sandy areas, which are very sensitive to drought and have poor water retention capabilities [
