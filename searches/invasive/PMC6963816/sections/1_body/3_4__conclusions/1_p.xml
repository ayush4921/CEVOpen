<p>According to our results, the appearance of common milkweed is strongly related to certain soil types (e.g., humic sandy soils), as well as certain physical, chemical soil properties (e.g., soil texture sandy loam soils, pH between 7.4 and 8.5, CaCO
 <sub>3</sub> content less than 14.1%), current land use type (e.g., natural grassland, or complex cultivation pattern), and certain types of land use change (e.g., land abandonment from arable lands into pastures). Our statistical analyses proved that this species is common in abandoned arable land, deforested clearings, and other areas with varying land cover. We could show that climate change also plays a role in the appearance of this species. In addition to increasing annual precipitation, evaporation and an increase in average annual temperatures (i.e., drier and drier summers) are particularly favorable for the presence of this species. The presented results provide important contributions for the future modeling of the spread of an invasive species, which in this case is spreading in 23 European countries at a significant rate, and to map its potential occurrence on a regional scale. The machine learning algorithm used in this study is not only suitable for identifying the environmental factors responsible for the appearance of a particular invasive plant, but we were also able to map the areas that could be potentially infected with common milkweed.
