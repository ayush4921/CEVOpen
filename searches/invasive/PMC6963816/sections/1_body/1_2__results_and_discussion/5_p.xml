<p>Most of the characteristics and conditions, then, correspond to rules that affect the current occurrence and the future spread of common milkweed relate to soil characteristics (10 out of 13) and land cover and land cover changes (6 out of 13) of the sample area (
 <xref rid="plants-08-00593-t0A1" ref-type="table">Table A1</xref>). Soil type and physical properties are the most important pedological factors influencing the appearance of the species (See 
 <xref rid="plants-08-00593-t0A1" ref-type="table">Table A1</xref>, Rules 1 and 13). According to academic literature, loose sandy soils are favored by this plant, because it can grow its rhizomes deep to the level of groundwater [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-08-00593" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Humic sandy soils, sandy loam, and loamy sand soil texture appear in most of the rules. In addition, slightly alkaline soils with a pH of 7.4â€“8.5 and a CaCO
 <sub>3</sub> content higher than 14.5% are favored by this plant. The current type of land cover is also an important factor for this species. Among the land cover categories of the 2012 CLC database, common milkweed prefers areas with complex cultivation patterns and natural grassland areas. The latter factor is of particular concern, because the natural grasslands that are native to the area have significant conservation value [

 <xref rid="B21-plants-08-00593" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This alien species prefers sandy soils with very low water absorption, high water conductivity, poor water storage capacity, and very low water retention properties [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-08-00593" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We found that, due to the current land cover, the appearance of common milkweed is also affected by land cover changes. We identified the types of land cover changes that promote the appearance of common milkweed.
