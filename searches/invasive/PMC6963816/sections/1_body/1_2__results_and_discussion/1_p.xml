 <xref rid="plants-08-00593-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> presents the confusion matrix of the validation, based on the test set consisting of 243 LUCAS observations, which were independent from the whole modeling process. Based on the confusion matrix the accuracy of the model—i.e., the sum of the true positives and true negatives divided by the total population—was equal to 0.843, which can be regarded as promising accuracy. However, the false negatives, also known as type II errors, were 28, which can be explained by the fact that the observations used in this study are unbalanced to the absence of milkweed.
