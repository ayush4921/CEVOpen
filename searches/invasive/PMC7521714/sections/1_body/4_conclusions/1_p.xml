<p>Phytosanitary systems are extremely important for controlling invasive species risk and plant health to protect agricultural and environmental systems. Prior to this project, very little was publically known about the Cuban phytosanitary system, leading it to be considered as a ‘black box’ by several countries in the region. Through this study, scientists in the US and Cuba developed shared understandings of their respective phytosanitary systems–information that is critical for safeguarding against invasive species, and also for potentially normalizing trade between the two countries. We provided a descriptive analysis of the characteristics and potential impacts of their organizational structure and diagnostic capacity on the regional economy, identifying important steps for further cooperation. Despite several shortcomings, the inherent strengths in the Cuban plant health system should benefit the region. However, some aspects of the Cuban phytosanitary system constrain its full potential. For example, key problems such as obsolete equipment and lack of digitalization were found. Moreover, it is unclear if pest management and early detection programs meet their goals, with repercussions to plant protection issues in the Caribbean region.</p>
