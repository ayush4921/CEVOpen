<p>Cuba is a large country in the Caribbean region with a Plant Health System that has evolved over the last 100 years, and, despite its economic struggles, has a strong plant health system that could nevertheless benefit from regional collaborative agreements. The experience and knowledge accumulated in Cuba can serve, in part, as a model for other plant health systems in the region seeking to create a cost-effective system with sustainable benefits. Enhanced communication and collaboration between researchers, agencies, and organizations is key to designing effective solutions against biological invasions [

The information retrieved by the workshops showed that there is a high level of uncertainty and even mystery regarding the inner workings of the Cuban phytosanitary system that disrupt effective collaboration. This lack of transparency is understandable considering the key role that this system plays in food security and, therefore, national security. However, the stakes of not engaging in collaboration are very high, and so nascent US-Cuba scientific collaborations must be strengthened through a trust-building process involving established and reliable networks focused on phytosanitary science not politics.
