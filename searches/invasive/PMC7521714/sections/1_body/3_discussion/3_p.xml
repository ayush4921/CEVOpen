<p>A key aspect of the Cuban phytosanitary system is its pest and disease monitoring system that covers most economically important crops in the country, providing pest thresholds to farmers. Human capital is one of the main and most significant assets in the SEPP, with high numbers of professionals, technicians, phytosanitary activists, and farmers, who receive continuous training through dissemination campaigns. Nevertheless, training programs do not always reach all farmers and proper training is lacking in relevant control strategies. Improved training to farmers on pesticide safety and other management methods should be considered to prevent adverse health effects and reduce ecological impacts.</p>
