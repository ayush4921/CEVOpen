<p>Adequate phytosanitary surveillance, which relies on sanitary and phytosanitary capacity, is key to successful national plant protection and international trade. Cuba has a solid organizational structure and legislation to support its Plant Health System. After the Revolution of 1959 and the subsequent establishment of a new agrarian policy, Cuba developed a mature and widespread network of research institutes, laboratories, stations, and human capital to assist plant health issues. The SEPP integrates different research institutes from different Ministries with a coordinated approach. The presence of these institutions, staffed by professionals and technicians from different plant health areas, defined hierarchies, and established roles and responsibilities, reinforces the preventive role of the system. However, key problems were identified across the SEPP that have a significant effects on how the system operates: Obsolete equipment, lack of digitalization, and financial constraints, impacts communication between laboratories and other institutions. These problems delay the response process when rapid response to face new potential threats is required.</p>
