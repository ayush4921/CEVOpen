<p>Exterior Quarantine phytosanitary inspectors, with an agronomy background, receive special training before starting their activities at their base units. New inspectors will typically receive plant health and professional development courses, taught every one or two years at the national level with focus on methodologies, procedures, legislation, and quarantine pests. Moreover, LAPROSAVsâ€™ specialists (i.e., entomologists, nematologists, virologists, pathologists) will train External Quarantine inspectors on pest identification, with focus on quarantine pests. Newly hired LAPROSAV entomologists are trained in different LAPROSAVs and in the LCCV, where they receive training on pest identification and procedures. ETPP specialists have a similar training program to External Quarantine phytosanitary inspectors, but with a focus on crop pests. Phytosanitary technicians from state companies and cooperatives, usually farmers or workers with advanced scientific and technical knowledge, are periodically trained by ETPP specialists on plant health issues. Moreover, they play an important role in phytosanitary surveillance and implementation of technologies at the local level, with an average of five to seven technicians per 645 km
