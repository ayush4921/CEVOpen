The SEPP is staffed by technicians and professionals graduated from different Cuban agricultural polytechnic institutes, research institutes and universities, with constant training and technical updates to improve the system’s capabilities. During the 1970s and 80s, scientists were trained through extensive exchange programs with the Soviet Block. Currently, annual seminars and courses are conducted for farmers, as well as for LAPROSAVs and ETPPs. Moreover, a series of professional events are offered from one to four years, such as national scientific-technical events for agricultural professionals and researchers, technological forums, international scientific seminars on plant health, and international symposia on phytosanitary surveillance. Training campaigns on prevention of invasive organisms have been relevant for phytosanitary programs. Every one or two years, a national entomology course is organized between INISAV and the Plant Quarantine Department to promote scientific-technical exchange. Moreover, the agricultural producer population is highly educated in comparison with other lesser-developed countries. Literacy level of farmers has been essential for a proper implementation of the system, as knowledge and information on methodologies reaches all the agricultural sector, supported by exchange programs facilitated by the farmer cooperatives.
