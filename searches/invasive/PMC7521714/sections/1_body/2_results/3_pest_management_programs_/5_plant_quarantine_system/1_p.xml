<p>The plant quarantine system is divided into an Interior Quarantine and an Exterior Quarantine, with a responsible chairman for each Department in each Province. Exterior quarantine is related to Points of Entry, including import inspections, export certificates (to authorize shipments), and surveillance in surrounding areas to ports and airports. Since 1996, External Quarantine work has been extended to cover also free-trade zones and industrial parks [

Phytosanitary import permits, including an international phytosanitary certificate issued by the official authority in the country of origin (according to IPPC), are required for imports of plant products, where the DSV conducts a pest risk analysis and issues the import permit when approved. All authorized imports are overseen by the DSV inspectors who will corroborate the fulfillment of import requirements in the country of origin, cancelling imports in cases of non-compliance [

As a contracting party of the IPPC, Cuba recognizes three groups of pests: quarantine pests A1 (pests not present in Cuba), quarantine pests A2 (pests that are present in Cuba but regulated under official control), and A3 regulated non-quarantine pests (non-quarantine pests which produce an economic impact and therefore are regulated for compliance with the importer country). The updating of pest lists is done as soon as the need for modifications is identified to assist contracting parties in issuing the correct phytosanitary certificates.
