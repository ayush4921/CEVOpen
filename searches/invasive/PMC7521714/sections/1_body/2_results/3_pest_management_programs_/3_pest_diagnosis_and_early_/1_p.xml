<p>Pest diagnostics and early detection involves identification of native and exotic plant pests and their natural enemies, including phytosanitary analysis of seeds, seedlings, and soil. Samples that require identification are received at the ETPPs, usually brought by agricultural producers, whether State operated, cooperatives, or small farmers, following specific sample collection instructions provided by the ETPPsâ€™ specialists. If needed, ETTP specialists can inspect the farm to confirm a diagnosis and provide recommendations. For forest pest diagnosis, Forest Rangers conduct surveillance, notifying the ETPPs and the Forestry Territorial Stations when a phytosanitary problem is detected, which will conduct the sampling and further identification. If the organism cannot be identified at the ETPP, the sample is sent to the LAPROSAV. Phytosanitary specialists, located on each LAPROSAV, are trained and updated periodically, with availability of collections, taxonomic keys, and monographs [
