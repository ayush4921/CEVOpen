<p>Pest surveillance, under the responsibility of the ETPPs, is done through what the Cubans call ‘Signaling and Forecasting System’ (Sistema de Señalización), considered the basis of Cuba’s agroecological approach to reduce chemical pesticides. Focusing on population dynamics, economic thresholds, weather, and natural enemies, pests are periodically monitored through a designated sampling method that includes surveillance of fixed plots and transects for each economically important crop. The economic thresholds, also referred as action thresholds, have been developed locally for different crops [

Pest records, together with phenological and meteorological data are analyzed locally at each LAPROSAV to model these economic thresholds, and when appropriate, a warning is issued to farmers about the pest problems to address, ensuring a rapid response when needed [

In this process, information on relevant pests, monitoring systems, and population thresholds to start mitigation measures, are provided to farmers. Depending on the crop, different mandatory management recommendations are given to farmers, providing technical support. However, farmers are not always properly served by specialists, with lack of specific training on applications and knowledge on the use of protective equipment [

Supported by quarantine defense programs and the survey system which processes approximately 35,000 samples per year, the SEPP guarantees the inspection and surveillance in 75% of agricultural areas, all quarantine stations, and urban areas [
