<p>Despite the strong organizational structure, some aspects of the Cuban phytosanitary system constrain its full potential. Key problems include laboratories with obsolete equipment, migration of young professionals to other job opportunities, and lack of digitized data for the SEPP. Only a few laboratories are stocked with up-to-date equipment (e.g., the Plant Quarantine Central Laboratory and the INISAV’s Chemistry Scientific and Technical Base Unit lab), whereas most laboratories have either obsolete equipment (from the 1980s), or a complete lack of equipment. Financial constraints limit the purchase of modern equipment in most laboratories. Nevertheless, in institutions like INISAV for example, personnel from the Department of Quality, Normalization and Metrology conduct annual certifications to the entire institute’s equipment to ensure proper operation. In recent years, young professionals from the plant health system, in particular from INISAV, have been leaving the institute to pursue better paid positions in the private sector. Therefore, most professionals with scientific and technical expertise are quite senior or retiring.</p>
