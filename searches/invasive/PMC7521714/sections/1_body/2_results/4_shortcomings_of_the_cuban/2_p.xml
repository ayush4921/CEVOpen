During 2017, INISAV started the implementation of the National System for Management of Phytosanitary Information (INFOSAV), in order to integrate information and communication technologies to capture, store and analyze plant health data, as well as multiple environmental variables (climatology, edaphology, and hydrology) using GIS tools. Currently, national plant health data is still being digitized into Excel datasets, with plans to implement a database system in the near future. However, the lack of internet access, combined with the lack of technology, slows down the process.
