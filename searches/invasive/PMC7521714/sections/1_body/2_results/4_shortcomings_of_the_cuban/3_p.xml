<p>It is unclear whether pest management programs meet their goals. For example, biocontrol programs are widely utilized and publicized. Since its implementation, more than 200,000 hectares are treated every year, with 60% reduction in imported synthetic pesticides [

 <xref rid="pone.0239808.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], no reports on compliance, nor reports on efficacy, exist or were provided to external evaluators. Moreover, agrochemicals are used at unjustified times with inadequate doses, resulting in failed pest control. Despite the technical support provided on agricultural management, farmers are not properly trained on chemical control applications, causing health risks for workers and nearby residents, together with environmental impacts. A recent study conducted in Sancti Spíritus, a province focused in agricultural production, showed that less than 30% of farmers received specific training on pesticides, with lack of knowledge and use of protective equipment, suggesting that farmers are not properly served by specialists [
