<p>Similarly, it is unknown if the early detection programs have prevented a pest from establishing. Despite the fact that the organizational structure and pest identification process has been described, little is known on how this operates at Points of Entry, including identification capacity of potential pests, inspections, fumigation, as well as response times. Pest identifiers at Points of Entry and the LAPROSAVs lack essential resources such as entomological collections.
