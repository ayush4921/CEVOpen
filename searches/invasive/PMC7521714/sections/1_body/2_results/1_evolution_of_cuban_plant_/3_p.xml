The phytosanitary management board of the National Institute of Agrarian Reform (INRA) installed a Central Phytosanitary Laboratory, currently known as the Plant Quarantine Central Laboratory (Laboratorio Central de Cuarentena Vegetal—LCCV), responsible for examining all imported vegetables and farm samples and diagnosing problems. During the 1960s, chemical applications of pesticides were based on fixed calendars; thus, by the end of the decade, intensive agriculture and synthetic pesticides usage had caused severe social, economic, and environmental impacts [

From 1975 to 1985, concerns about the ineffectiveness of chemical control alone and the emergence of new pests contributed to strengthening the plant health system with the development of protocols for pest monitoring, and targeted chemical control. By the mid 1970s the Cuban State Plant Protection System (SEPP) was established [
