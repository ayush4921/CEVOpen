From 1985 to 1992, phytosanitary policy focused on the development of IPM programs, through the consolidation of the ‘pest signaling methods’ for monitoring and implementation of the National Program for Production of Biological Control.

In 1988, the National Program for Production of Biological Control established a network of laboratories called Centers for the Reproduction of Entomophages and Entomopathogens (Centros Reproductores de Entomófagos y Entomopatógenos—CREEs) [
