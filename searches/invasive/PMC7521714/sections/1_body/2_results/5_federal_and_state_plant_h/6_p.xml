<p>In the same context, a participatory workshop was held in Cuba to address phytosanitary collaboration opportunities between the two countries during 2018, with participants from the USDA, INISAV, and the University of Florida. A variety of strengths and areas of opportunity were identified for both systems. The perceived strengths of the United States system include flow of scientific information across all levels for decision-making processes, a robust infrastructure and access to state-of-the-art technology, highly trained human resources, and collaboration with national and international entities, while the strengths for the Cuban system mainly concentrate on trained human capital, collaboration between national institutions, and the surveillance system. The main strength of the Cuban system regarding collaboration resides in the strong exchange of information among research centers, done with participatory approaches. However, workshop participants suggested that the system should enhance the relationship between research and industry, as well as its international collaborations. The commercial restrictions imposed by the embargo were identified as the main barrier for scientific and commercial exchange between Cuba and the United States. Similarly, the process followed by the United States phytosanitary system to allow the import of agricultural products is perceived as lengthy, challenging, and highly bureaucratic.</p>
