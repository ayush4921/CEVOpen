<p>Participants from the workshop held at the University of Florida during March 2018 had little previous understanding of the inner workings of the Cuban plant health system. Members from U.S. Federal and State of Florida plant health agencies that participated in the workshop, stressed the need to create partnerships, build trust, and support joint efforts to obtain a clearer sense of how their system operates. Despite the concerns regarding identification capacity, generational gaps, and capacity to respond to a new threat, the strength of the SEPP and pest surveillance was recognized by the participants. Politics or the political climate was identified as a significant barrier for free information sharing between both systems. Science and politics are intimately related given the reciprocal effects that one can have on the other, adding further motivation to build trust between the Cuban and United States phytosanitary systems.</p>
