<p>The large number of Cuban ports and airports (~30) in relation to the country’s size, represents a major concern of plant health vulnerability. Little is known about how inspections are conducted at Points of Entry and if current identification capacity can early detect new interceptions or establishments. The Cuban system has a considerable number of individuals working on pest identification and treatment, but it seems to lack the pest control technology required by effective early warning and forecasting systems. The generational gap in knowledge of Cuban scientists was identified both as a potential risk and an area of collaboration, “they are very well trained in pests that have been around for decades, but not so on novel and emerging pests. Many of the lead Cuban scientists were trained in Eastern Europe during the 1990s, and the new generations of scientists need to be trained on these topics.” The scarce pest control technologies and resources, together with the lack proper training, creates lower confidence on Cuban pest lists, perceived by participants as less reliable when compared to other countries.</p>
