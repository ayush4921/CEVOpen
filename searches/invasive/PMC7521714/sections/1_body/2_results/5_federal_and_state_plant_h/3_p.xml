<p>Participants identified several knowns and unknowns of Cuba’s phytosanitary system. The structure of the system, which was presented in detail to participants, was identified by all participants as clear. Participants also highlighted that the phytosanitary system presents stable institutions and has a good amount of manpower working on the field. However, there are multiple unknowns about how effectively the system’s structure actually operates. The Cuban system relies on a train-the-trainer type of approach and it is unclear how effective that approach is. In addition, several questions exist regarding how the different ports operate. For example, it was mentioned that the number of tree pests detected over time in Cuba seems too low (based on experiences from other similar settings).</p>
