<p>Efforts to strengthen plant health systems through collaboration, including regulatory frameworks, are underway in many regions. Two initiatives exist in the Caribbean and Central America: 1) the Greater Caribbean Safeguarding Initiative (between the United States Department of Agricultureâ€™s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service-APHIS and some countries from the Caribbean Region); and 2) International Regional Organization for Plant Protection and Animal Health-OIRSA (Regional Plant Protection Organization for Central America and Dominican Republic). These initiatives aim to protect their territories and economies from the introduction and spread of high-risk pests through collaborative efforts, regulatory commitments, and information exchange. However, Cuba is not part of these initiatives, missing potential benefits from the different collaborative agreements.</p>
