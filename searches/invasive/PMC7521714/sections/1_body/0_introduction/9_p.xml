<p>With the Obama administration’s resumption of diplomatic relations with Cuba, United States regulations began to evolve in ways that provided opportunities for export of a small range of goods from Cuba to the United States. Currently, only charcoal is allowed to be exported from Cuba to the United States. Despite the fact that we expect trade to increase over time, we lack the data needed to predict the arrival of new plant pests from Cuba or to plan a response. This also poses a major dilemma for Cuba—even if the United States economic embargo were lifted immediately, it may take a decade or more to build the regulatory apparatus significantly expand certain commercial activities with Cuba, including sales of fresh fruits and vegetables. In order to harmonize both systems and reduce potential delays, United States agencies need to: 1) understand the organizational structure and analytic capacity of the Cuban Plant Protection System; 2) identify potential synergies between the United States and Cuban systems; and 3) suggest future steps for cooperation.</p>
