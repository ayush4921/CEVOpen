<p>This paper fills this void by presenting a novel descriptive analysis of the plant health system in Cuba. This review integrates information from literature, informal interviews with Cuban experts, and workshops focused on Cuban policies, risk, and potential collaboration attended by Cuban and American experts. The historical context of the phytosanitary system in the country is provided, followed by the description of its organizational structure. Secondly, Cubaâ€™s integrated pest management (IPM) programs, pest surveillance, and strengths and shortcomings of the system, are described. Finally, synergies between the Cuban and United States plant protection systems are identified to define next steps in a future collaboration, focusing on sharing information, identifying potential threats, and developing effective rapid response strategies. This paper contains the first published, detailed description and analysis of the Cuban plant health system.</p>
