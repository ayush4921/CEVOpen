<p>When evaluating the local extent model ensemble predictions, Joshua Tree National Park contains a predicted 204,957 ha of fountain grass suitable habitat (64% of the park; calculated using the one percentile threshold and including any location where at least half the models agreed it was suitable). There are several known occurrence points, most of which are in the western portion of the park (

Discussions with park staff revealed a new population found within the middle of the park occurred in predicted suitable habitat from the model ensemble. Portions of the remote eastern portion of the park, which has not been surveyed, contain suitable habitat as well, and managers discussed wanting to prioritize surveys in those locations after viewing the mapped predictions. Within Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, there are an estimated 18,185 ha of suitable habitat (61% of the park). Two of the known occurrence points occur within the park boundary (
