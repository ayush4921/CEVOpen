<p>The CalFlora independent dataset for fountain grass supported good performance across the threshold model ensemble (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229253.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The majority of the occurrences were in areas where six or more models agreed across all thresholds. As expected, the most restrictive 10th percentile model ensemble (i.e., where 10% of training points are excluded from the binary definition of suitability) had the lowest sensitivity, with most of the independent records located in areas where three to six models agreed. In the inclusive MPP threshold model ensemble, all occurrences were located in areas where seven or more models agreed.
