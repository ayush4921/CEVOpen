<p>Goutweed models had cross-validation AUC values &gt; 0.88 (Table C in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0229253.s001">S1 File</xref>). AUC-PR values varied, with the MARS KDE model having the lowest performance at 0.43 and the BRT target model having the highest at 0.75. The threshold-dependent evaluation metrics were also mixed with Kappa ranging from 0.34 (GLM KDE and MARS KDE) to 0.69 (RF target). The True Skill Statistic was more similar across models with all values &gt; 0.64. Similar to fountain grass models, BRT and RF generally performed better than GLM and MARS. However, the target background models performed better than the KDE background models for goutweed (Table C in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0229253.s001">S1 File</xref>).
