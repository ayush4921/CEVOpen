<p>All model performance metrics are specific to the focal dataset, and are generally higher for lower prevalence species. Metrics provide a reliable comparison among models for a given species and dataset, while comparisons of model performance across species are confounded by variation in prevalence. Random cross-validation indicated reasonable model fit for fountain grass, with the minimum AUC and AUC-PR values across all ten models &gt; 0.91 and &gt; 0.79, respectively (Table C in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0229253.s001">S1 File</xref>). Threshold-dependent performance metric values (at the Sensitivity = Specificity threshold) for PCC, Kappa and True Skill Statistic values were all &gt; 83%, &gt; 0.62 and &gt; 0.67, respectively. In general, BRT and RF models had the highest cross-validation statistics while GLM and MARS had the lowest. Models utilizing the KDE background method performed better than the target background models with the exception of the GLM model.
