<p>The regional map of the model ensembles at the one percentile threshold reported suitable habitat in several parks not known to contain the species (Tables 
 <xref rid="pone.0229253.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0229253.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). There are 14 parks that intersect the Lake Mead EPMT region, including seven with predicted suitable habit (ranging from &lt; 1% to 64% of the park unit) and two with known occurrences. Two of the parks that have predicted suitable habitat and no known occurrences were within 20 km of a known location. There are 12 parks occurring in the Great Lakes EPMT region, all of which are predicted to contain at least some suitable habitat for goutweed ranging from 27 to 20,373 ha, representing 9% to 98% of park units. Three of the 12 parks had occurrence records in the aggregated data used to develop the model, with an additional six parks having a location within 15 km of the park boundary.
