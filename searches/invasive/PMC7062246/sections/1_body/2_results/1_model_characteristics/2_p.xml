<p>The models for goutweed retained 18 environmental variables (Table B in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0229253.s001">S1 File</xref>). The most important variable for goutweed models with KDE background was the landscape condition model (ranging from 34% to 54%), with maximum mean summer temperature in the top three for three of the KDE models. For the target background runs, average annual precipitation, average minimum winter temperature and summer potential evapotranspiration were generally the three most important variables. Goutweed habitat suitability decreased with increasing landscape condition and suitability was dependent on having at least 1,500 mm of mean annual precipitation (Figure A in
