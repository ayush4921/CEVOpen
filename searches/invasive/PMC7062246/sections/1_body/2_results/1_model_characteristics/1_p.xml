<p>We retained 16 variables for fountain grass model development (Table B in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0229253.s001">S1 File</xref>), although the set varied depending on background method and differences in collinearity. The human influence index and minimum winter temperature consistently fell in the top three variables ranked by percent contribution across model runs. For target background runs, spring mean potential evapotranspiration was also in the top three variable grouping. For KDE background runs, over-winter evapotranspiration completed the top three except for BRT where it ranked fourth. Fountain grass habitat suitability was associated with higher minimum winter temperatures and moderate human influence (Figure A in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0229253.s001">S1 File</xref>). It was also generally associated with higher over-winter evapotranspiration values and lower spring mean potential evapotranspiration.
