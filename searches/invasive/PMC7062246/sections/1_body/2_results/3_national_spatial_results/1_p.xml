<p>The national map for fountain grass using the one percentile threshold model ensemble showed high suitability in the southwestern U.S. extending from California to Texas (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229253.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The map also highlighted the southeast from Florida to South Carolina as potentially suitable for fountain grass. The national map for goutweed (also using the one percentile threshold) predicted relatively high suitability in the northeast and Midwest U.S. It also showed moderate suitability in the northwest where goutweed has also become a problematic invasive species. Across the U.S., there was a large amount of extrapolation in all models as indicated by the MESS maps (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229253.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Fountain grass has areas of extrapolation in the northern third of the contiguous U.S. and portions of the southeast. Goutweed model extrapolation occurred across much of the west and the southeastern U.S.
