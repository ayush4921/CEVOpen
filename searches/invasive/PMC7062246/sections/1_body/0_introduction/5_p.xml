<p>Here, we outline a robust and efficient methodology for the initial development of multiple, credible SDMs of invasive plant species. Our objective is to establish a modeling protocol that leverages existing data and balances automation with human intervention to perform model analyses for several species using a curated suite of contiguous U.S. variables at 90 m resolution that could be useful at national, regional and local scales. The methods also utilize improved computing power to create models with a large extent and fine grain size to deliver results useful at multiple spatial extents (

 <italic>Pennisetum setaceum</italic> [Forssk.] Chiov.), a broadly-established invader in the U.S. since the 1940s, and goutweed (
 <italic>Aegopodium podagraria</italic> L.), an invader in the U.S. since the 1860s, but with a more limited distribution.
