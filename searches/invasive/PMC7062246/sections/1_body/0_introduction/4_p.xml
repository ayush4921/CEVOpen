<p>Management of invasive plant species occurs at both broad and local scales and often requires combining multiple analyses and reviewing multiple maps (
 <xref rid="pone.0229253.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). National-extent maps are often too coarse in resolution (e.g., 1 km) for decisions within a management unit, while fine resolution, small-extent (local) maps only include a tiny portion of the landscape, making regional decisions and cross-agency coordination difficult. A small number of invasive species cause a majority of the impacts to local biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and human well-being [
 <xref rid="pone.0229253.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but across large or diverse geographic areas, there may be many species of management interest. Moving forward, the scope of species distribution models needs to be inclusive of large geographic regions, while the geographic precision of models needs to be fine-scale enough to make predictions within an individual management unit. Developing a set of input data covering a large geographic extent at a fine resolution for use in modeling the broad set of invasive species of management interest could make a single set of models useful for local targeting in the invaded range and regional or national risk assessment beyond the current range boundaries.
