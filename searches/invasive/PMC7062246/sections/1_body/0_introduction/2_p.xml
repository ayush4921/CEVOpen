<p>Species distribution models (SDMs) are commonly used to estimate potential distributions of invasive species and to assess what areas contain suitable habitat. Correlative SDMs estimate the occurrence of a species based on habitat attributes such as climate, soils, and land use [

These models are then spatially projected to represent the modeled species’ potential habitat and provide an objective tool to understand the distribution of invasive species. However, the credibility of different SDMs varies widely based on the quality of information used in making models, choices made in the modeling process, and to what degree natural history information and expert opinion factor into the modeling process [

Making the most credible SDM takes considerable effort and often requires collecting information that is not readily available (e.g., on species absence and detection probability), while a fully automated process using a standard set of existing information may produce many models quickly but has less credibility. Iterative modeling, the incremental improvement of SDMs based on added information and modified modeling processes over time, provides a way to minimize the tradeoffs between quality and quantity of models created and to objectively demonstrate improvement of models with the use of additional information, including new data, expert review, and field validation [
