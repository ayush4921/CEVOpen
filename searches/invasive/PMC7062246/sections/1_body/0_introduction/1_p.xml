<p>The ongoing global spread of harmful exotic plant species is increasing their occupancy and abundance, posing challenges for natural areas, where successful management of natural resources may depend on prevention, containment, and control of invaders [

 <xref rid="pone.0229253.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Knowledge of where invasive plants occur is a pre-requisite for efficient mitigation of their impact and minimization of their spread [
 <xref rid="pone.0229253.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. At broad geographic scales, such as across biomes, watch lists and risk assessments rely on information about the current distribution of invasive species across geographic and environmental conditions [

 <xref rid="pone.0229253.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. At local scales, such as protected areas or U.S. counties, search efforts to find new populations of invasive species and to target management actions are guided by maps of invasive plant species occurrence and modeled habitat suitability [
