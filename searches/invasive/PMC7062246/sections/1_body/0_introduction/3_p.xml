<p>The intended use of habitat suitability model results is a critical consideration when developing SDM methodologies [
 <xref rid="pone.0229253.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. An automated methodology requiring little human intervention in the modeling process can quickly produce models for a large number of species. Such models can provide broad biogeographical perspectives and be informative for global and continental biodiversity assessments, but careful methodological consideration is always necessary and guidelines have been developed for these contexts [
 <xref rid="pone.0229253.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In contrast, tailoring the model and input data, including collecting higher quality data than may readily exist, is appropriate for high-stakes decisions like those involving regulatory decisions [
 <xref rid="pone.0229253.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Invasive species often sit at an intermediate point in terms of data availability, stakes of the decisions, and resources available for modeling and management. The sheer number of established and potential exotic plant species for which SDMs might provide critical distributional information remains a major challenge [

 <xref rid="pone.0229253.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and at the same time, credibility for species-specific management responses is often needed. Striking a balance among these aspects of SDMs can be a challenge, especially when multiple species and multiple spatial scales are of interest.
