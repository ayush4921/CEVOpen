<p>Our results provide one model ensemble prediction for each species that can be interpreted across broad to local extents whereas most published single invasive species maps are only applicable to one or two extents (
 <xref rid="pone.0229253.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). At the national extent, these models show the current status or scope of the problem across the nation, highlighting regions of invasion or potential invasion that may be geographically distant from one another. For example, fountain grass is known to be a problematic invader in the west; however, the national model shows that the southeast portion of the country could also be susceptible to invasion (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229253.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Interpreting the models at the national scale assesses the speciesâ€™ impact across very different ecological regions of the country and the risk of invasion could be overlooked if the model was not developed at the national scale [
 <xref rid="pone.0229253.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These models can also be interpreted regionally to assess the potential for invasion in the context of multiple land ownerships and uses. At the regional level, we identified multiple national parks that have not detected the invasive species of concern but likely have suitable habitat based on our model predictions (Tables 
 <xref rid="pone.0229253.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0229253.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The use of the model at this regional extent can assess the level of risk of an invader by evaluating the potential suitable habitat for a management area as it relates to the proximity to the closest known occurrence based on the data used to develop the model [
 <xref rid="pone.0229253.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Finally, at the local extent, these models can be used to guide early detection and rapid-response (EDRR) or control efforts. Model results can be viewed within administrative boundaries and at a resolution of 90 m, providing enough detail for managers to guide surveys to local incipient populations and to target control actions towards locations that will contribute to containment or impact reduction [
