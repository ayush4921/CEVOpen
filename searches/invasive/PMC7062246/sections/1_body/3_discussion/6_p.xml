<p>There are many pitfalls, assumptions, and caveats of correlative species distribution models [

 <xref rid="pone.0229253.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Despite these caveats, species distribution models can be useful in informing management activities (see examples in [
 <xref rid="pone.0229253.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]). We addressed the primary challenges we identified as impacting distribution modeling. We incorporated multiple factors that may control species distribution at different scales, moving beyond strictly climate envelopes. This suite covers a range of categories of predictor type and included the best available resolutions for nationally consistent data. Since our scope was limited to plants, we created a suite of common distributional drivers that drive many invasive plant speciesâ€™ distribution while also moving beyond readily available bioclimatic variables [
 <xref rid="pone.0229253.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, this suite could easily be augmented to include variables that would also be applicable to other taxonomic groups. We used aggregated occurrence data and accounted for potential biases in two different ways to overcome limitations in available data. Our framework allows for the flexibility to include other background selection approaches that have been recently proposed (e.g.,[
 <xref rid="pone.0229253.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]) in this process if they demonstrate improvements to the modeling process. These products could be used to develop sampling schemes that could provide more information to improve models in the future [

 <xref rid="pone.0229253.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Finally, we use model ensembles to encompass uncertainty among algorithms, and visualize response curves to assess overfitting and ecoplausibility and compare among models [
