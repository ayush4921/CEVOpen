<p>Our methodology and results present and demonstrate an approach to develop and use national-scale invasive species habitat suitability models that support multi-scale interpretation that can support multiple uses and audiences. We provide a framework that leverages the skills of modeling experts, the species-specific knowledge from field managers and researchers, and a process for iterative modeling. We use readily available occurrence and national extent environmental variable data to develop invasive species suitability models that are grounded in acceptable practices for species distribution modeling [

 <xref rid="pone.0229253.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Future development should focus on application of the framework to other invasive plant species, implementation of the iterative process, and delivery of model results to practitioners. The model results are seamless across the continental U.S. and can easily be applied to other species of interest. Once the framework has been applied to a large set of species, the set of model results can be combined to identify potential hot spots of invasion or efficiencies in management across species (e.g., single crew targeting multiple species in an area). A key step is to provide a mechanism to easily transfer the results from this methodology to managers making decisions at these different geographic extents.
