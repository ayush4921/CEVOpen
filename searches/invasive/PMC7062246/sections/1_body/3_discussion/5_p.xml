<p>A key aspect in our approach is a framework for iterative modeling in which use of the model will improve future versions (‘Expert Review’ and ‘Model Application’ feed back into model development,

Iterative modeling provides an opportunity to develop a suite of necessarily imprecise models for multiple species and improve models through their use. Models can undergo a new iteration upon the collection of new occurrence data, new environmental variables or from the review of the response curves and spatial results from experts. For example, as remote sensing technology improves spatial resolution and coverage, these new environmental data can be incorporated into the environmental variable library to provide additional predictive power that has been shown to effectively map invasive spices populations in localized examples [

Future versions will need to be determined based on the frequency and quality of incoming data or expert review. Iterative monitoring and modeling are essential to continually improving models to inform decisions and management actions [

 <xref rid="pone.0229253.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. For example, model-informed decision-making that includes surveys for new populations can be used to assess model performance and the information gathered can be included in iterative model updates.
