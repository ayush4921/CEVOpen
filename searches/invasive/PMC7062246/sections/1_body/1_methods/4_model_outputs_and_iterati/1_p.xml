<p>Each continuous model was classified to represent suitable and unsuitable habitat using the minimum predicted presence (MPP) threshold, one percentile threshold, ten percentile threshold, and the maximum sensitivity plus specificity (MSS) threshold. Each threshold falls on a spectrum from a more restrictive to more inclusive prediction of habitat suitability. Depending on the intended use of the model, one threshold may be preferred over the other or multiple thresholds may be used to present different representations of habitat suitability for an invasive species [

 <xref rid="pone.0229253.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Therefore, we provide multiple threshold options in our modeling workflow that can be considered by practitioners. The MPP, one percent and ten percent thresholds are determined by the value at which the minimum, lowest one percent or lowest ten percent of the training data occurrences was classified as being in unsuitable, respectively. The MSS threshold is the value of the maximum of the true positive rate (sensitivity) plus the true negative rate (specificity). For statistical evaluations of the models, we used the value at which sensitivity equals specificity. Finally, all ten binary models for each species were combined to create a single, equal weight model ensemble map to represent the number of models predicting suitable habitat for the focal invasive species at a given threshold (‘Threshold and Ensemble Model Outputs’,

Along with these mapped outputs, SAHM produces variable response curves showing the general relationship between each variable and suitability for the species and a measure of variable importance. We evaluated variable importance for each model based on change in the AUC statistic (ΔAUC) when values for that variable were permutated between presence and background, then ranked variables within each model relative ΔAUC.
