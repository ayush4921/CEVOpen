<p>Resource managers pointed us to an independent data set to evaluate the fountain grass models in California, CalFlora (accessed 12 December 2018 resulting in 898 cleaned occurrence records not contained in the training occurrence data set [
 <xref rid="pone.0229253.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]). These were used as an independent validation data set for fountain grass to evaluate how many occurrences were captured at each model ensemble value for each threshold and provides a valuable resource to independently validate model performance (‘Independent Data Evaluation’, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229253.g001">Fig 1</xref>). We did not have an independent test data set for goutweed. We also categorized the model ensemble for each species using a model assessment rubric to describe each model’s attributes related to species data, environmental predictors, modeling process, and model products using three classifications: ‘interpret with caution’, ‘acceptable’, or ‘ideal’ following Sofaer et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0229253.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] who defined criteria to classify each specific attribute of the model process into each of these categories. These classifications are meant to inform use, where different uses may require different levels of classification (e.g., model to guide search to improve model versus a model used for regulatory decisions).
