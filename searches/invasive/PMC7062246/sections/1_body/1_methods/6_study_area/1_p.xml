<p>We focus on three scales of invasion risk map interpretation for each species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229253.g002">Fig 2</xref>). At the largest extent, both species were evaluated at the contiguous U.S. At the regional scale, we used the National Park Service Exotic Plant Management Teams (EPMT) geographical regions. These regions serve as the source of invasive plant management expertise and field support to the national parks within each boundary. This may include inventory, treatment, and ecological restoration. For fountain grass, we focused on the Lake Mead region and for goutweed we focused on the Great Lakes region. Finally, at the local extent, we evaluated models for individual national park units. These units were Joshua Tree National Park and Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore for fountain grass and goutweed, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229253.g002">Fig 2</xref>). For regional risk assessment from the perspective of the NPS EPMT, we considered the number of park units within their focal management regions containing suitable habitat for the species. We used the percentile threshold to calculate identify the park units and the area of suitable habitat within each park unit. We also conducted a nearest occurrence location analysis to provide the distance to the nearest known occurrence if a park unit was not identified to have suitable habitat.
