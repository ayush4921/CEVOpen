<p>We selected two invasive species of interest to managers of natural areas: fountain grass (
 <italic>Pennisetum setaceum</italic> [Forssk.] Chiov.) and goutweed (
 <italic>Aegopodium podagraria</italic> L.). Fountain grass is a perennial C4 bunch grass native to North Africa and the Middle East, but has been widely planted as an ornamental in the U.S. and has expanded into natural areas [
 <xref rid="pone.0229253.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The species is most problematic in the southwest U.S. and Hawaii, where it quickly outcompetes native flora creating a monoculture that becomes a fire hazard and alters fire regimes in systems that are not historically fire-adapted [
