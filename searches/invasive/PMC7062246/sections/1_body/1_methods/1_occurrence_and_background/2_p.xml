<p>We used a background sample approach to develop SDMs for each species since absence data are rare and can be unreliable for invaders that are still expanding [
 <xref rid="pone.0229253.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We developed models using two background method generation approaches since the choice of background method, including location extent and placement, can strongly affect model results [
 <xref rid="pone.0229253.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. First, we developed a continuous kernel density estimation (KDE) layer around the occurrences for each species (termed ‘KDE Background Data’, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229253.g001">Fig 1</xref>), restricted in extent to a minimum convex polygon around occurrences that was buffered by 1/3 of the maximum difference between minimum and maximum X coordinates and minimum and maximum Y coordinates. This KDE approach results in the background sample density correlating with the occurrence point density and was proposed as an appropriate method for spreading invasive species by up-weighting locations that may be at the invasion front [
 <xref rid="pone.0229253.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Our second background sampling approach was the target guild method (termed ‘Target Background Data’, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229253.g001">Fig 1</xref>), which uses presence locations from similar species as background points [
 <xref rid="pone.0229253.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], to mimic sampling bias in the presence data under the assumption that locations from the same data sets for similar species would have the same sampling biases. To develop the background samples for this ‘target’ model methodology, we obtained a list of species from the USDA Plants Database designated as introduced across the entirety of the continental United States. We then obtained aggregated data following the protocol above for all introduced species. We restricted the extent from which we selected target background locations to a binary 99% isopleth KDE based on the presence locations to ensure we were limiting them to accessible areas [
 <xref rid="pone.0229253.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. To model a focal invader, we subset the introduced species occurrences based on the life form of the species of interest (e.g., grass for fountain grass and forb or herb for goutweed) as defined by USDA Plants Database. These occurrences, filtered by lifeform, became our target background data and were additionally checked for accuracy by mapping their distribution.
