We present a general approach to invasive species modeling and mapping that meets objectives at multiple scales. Our methodology is designed to balance trade-offs between developing highly customized models for few species versus fitting non-specific and generic models for numerous species. We developed a national library of environmental variables known to physiologically limit plant distributions and relied on human input based on natural history knowledge to further narrow the variable set for each species before developing habitat suitability models. To ensure efficiency, we used largely automated modeling approaches and human input only at key junctures. We explore and present uncertainty by using two alternative sources of background samples, including five statistical algorithms, and constructing model ensembles. We demonstrate the use and efficiency of the Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling [SAHM 2.1.2], a package in VisTrails, which performs the majority of the modeling analyses. Our workflow includes solicitation of expert feedback on model outputs such as spatial prediction results and variable response curves, and iterative improvement based on new data availability and directed field validation of initial model results. We highlight the utility of the models for decision-making at regional and local scales with case studies of two plant species that invade natural areas: fountain grass (<italic>Pennisetum setaceum</italic>) and goutweed (<italic>Aegopodium podagraria</italic>). By balancing model automation with human intervention, we can efficiently provide land managers with mapped predicted distributions for multiple invasive species to inform decisions across spatial scales.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>USGS Invasive Species Program</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Core Science Systems</institution></funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the USGS Invasive Species Program and Core Science Systems.

Knowledge of where invasive plants occur is a pre-requisite for efficient mitigation of their impact and minimization of their spread [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. At broad geographic scales, such as across biomes, watch lists and risk assessments rely on information about the current distribution of invasive species across geographic and environmental conditions [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. At local scales, such as protected areas or U.S. counties, search efforts to find new populations of invasive species and to target management actions are guided by maps of invasive plant species occurrence and modeled habitat suitability [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Species distribution models (SDMs) are commonly used to estimate potential distributions of invasive species and to assess what areas contain suitable habitat. Correlative SDMs estimate the occurrence of a species based on habitat attributes such as climate, soils, and land use [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These models are then spatially projected to represent the modeled species&#x02019; potential habitat and provide an objective tool to understand the distribution of invasive species. However, the credibility of different SDMs varies widely based on the quality of information used in making models, choices made in the modeling process, and to what degree natural history information and expert opinion factor into the modeling process [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Making the most credible SDM takes considerable effort and often requires collecting information that is not readily available (e.g., on species absence and detection probability), while a fully automated process using a standard set of existing information may produce many models quickly but has less credibility. Iterative modeling, the incremental improvement of SDMs based on added information and modified modeling processes over time, provides a way to minimize the tradeoffs between quality and quantity of models created and to objectively demonstrate improvement of models with the use of additional information, including new data, expert review, and field validation [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The intended use of habitat suitability model results is a critical consideration when developing SDM methodologies [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. An automated methodology requiring little human intervention in the modeling process can quickly produce models for a large number of species. Such models can provide broad biogeographical perspectives and be informative for global and continental biodiversity assessments, but careful methodological consideration is always necessary and guidelines have been developed for these contexts [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In contrast, tailoring the model and input data, including collecting higher quality data than may readily exist, is appropriate for high-stakes decisions like those involving regulatory decisions [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Invasive species often sit at an intermediate point in terms of data availability, stakes of the decisions, and resources available for modeling and management. The sheer number of established and potential exotic plant species for which SDMs might provide critical distributional information remains a major challenge [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and at the same time, credibility for species-specific management responses is often needed. Striking a balance among these aspects of SDMs can be a challenge, especially when multiple species and multiple spatial scales are of interest.</p><p>Management of invasive plant species occurs at both broad and local scales and often requires combining multiple analyses and reviewing multiple maps (<xref rid="pone.0229253.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). National-extent maps are often too coarse in resolution (e.g., 1 km) for decisions within a management unit, while fine resolution, small-extent (local) maps only include a tiny portion of the landscape, making regional decisions and cross-agency coordination difficult. A small number of invasive species cause a majority of the impacts to local biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and human well-being [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but across large or diverse geographic areas, there may be many species of management interest. Moving forward, the scope of species distribution models needs to be inclusive of large geographic regions, while the geographic precision of models needs to be fine-scale enough to make predictions within an individual management unit. Developing a set of input data covering a large geographic extent at a fine resolution for use in modeling the broad set of invasive species of management interest could make a single set of models useful for local targeting in the invaded range and regional or national risk assessment beyond the current range boundaries.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0229253.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0229253.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Invasive species distribution model interpretation scales (national, regional, local) and their audience, use and select examples from the literature.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0229253.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0229253.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Scale</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Extent Example</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Audience</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Primary Use</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>National</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Contiguous U.S.</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Federal land management agencies, National policy actors, Federal plant and animal health protection organizations</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Understand the potential scope of the problem [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

Records from the Bureau of Land Management&#x02019;s (BLM) and the National Park Service (NPS) National Invasive Species Information Management System databases and data from the BLM Assessment Inventory and Monitoring program were added to these results. We filtered the aggregated data by observation type (observation or specimen only), observation date (1980 to present), and coordinate uncertainty (&#x02264; 30 m). We removed any records with coordinates corresponding to state or country centroids or other identifiable geographic and taxonomic errors. We also checked the entire dataset for duplicate records. We obtained data for fountain grass (accessed 24 July 2018) and goutweed (accessed 29 April 2019) [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Once downloaded and filtered, the data were mapped and visually checked for accuracy (&#x02018;Examine Occurrence Maps&#x02019;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229253.g001">Fig 1</xref>). We had 3,422 unique fountain grass locations and 1,168 unique goutweed locations for model development that resulted from the data download script.</p><p>We used a background sample approach to develop SDMs for each species since absence data are rare and can be unreliable for invaders that are still expanding [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We developed models using two background method generation approaches since the choice of background method, including location extent and placement, can strongly affect model results [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. First, we developed a continuous kernel density estimation (KDE) layer around the occurrences for each species (termed &#x02018;KDE Background Data&#x02019;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229253.g001">Fig 1</xref>), restricted in extent to a minimum convex polygon around occurrences that was buffered by 1/3 of the maximum difference between minimum and maximum X coordinates and minimum and maximum Y coordinates. This KDE approach results in the background sample density correlating with the occurrence point density and was proposed as an appropriate method for spreading invasive species by up-weighting locations that may be at the invasion front [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Our second background sampling approach was the target guild method (termed &#x02018;Target Background Data&#x02019;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229253.g001">Fig 1</xref>), which uses presence locations from similar species as background points [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], to mimic sampling bias in the presence data under the assumption that locations from the same data sets for similar species would have the same sampling biases. To develop the background samples for this &#x02018;target&#x02019; model methodology, we obtained a list of species from the USDA Plants Database designated as introduced across the entirety of the continental United States. We then obtained aggregated data following the protocol above for all introduced species. We restricted the extent from which we selected target background locations to a binary 99% isopleth KDE based on the presence locations to ensure we were limiting them to accessible areas [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. To model a focal invader, we subset the introduced species occurrences based on the life form of the species of interest (e.g., grass for fountain grass and forb or herb for goutweed) as defined by USDA Plants Database. These occurrences, filtered by lifeform, became our target background data and were additionally checked for accuracy by mapping their distribution.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Environmental variables</title><p>We compiled a national library of potential environmental variables to consider for the distribution modeling. We only considered variables available throughout the contiguous U.S (&#x02018;National Predictor Library&#x02019; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229253.g001">Fig 1</xref>). These variables were compiled based on consideration of what environmental factors may limit plant species&#x02019; distributions and we selected environmental variables that captured attributes such as water balance and temperature extremes known to physiologically limit plant distributions [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We included the most up-to-date representation of climatic, topographic, soil, land use, and anthropogenic factors that have coverage across the contiguous U.S. at the highest spatial resolution available (Table A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0229253.s001">S1 File</xref>). The curation of this library of variables was intentional and rigorous, and included custom derived metrics and widely-used canned datasets such as Bioclim [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A total of 60 environmental variables were compiled and were considered for model development (Table A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0229253.s001">S1 File</xref>). All environmental variables were processed to the Alber&#x02019;s Equal Area coordinate reference system, continental U.S. extent, cell size (90 m) using the nearest neighbor method of resampling and alignment using the <italic>PARC</italic> (Project, Aggregate, Resample, Clip) module in the Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling (SAHM, [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]) (&#x02018;Environmental Variable Preparation&#x02019;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229253.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p><p>A critical aspect of our modeling workflow was the species-specific selection of predictor variables, which used a combination of automatic and human input processes (&#x02018;Species&#x02019; Variable Selection&#x02019; and &#x02018;Final Variable Selection&#x02019;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229253.g001">Fig 1</xref>). First, we conducted a literature review for each species to help inform which environmental variables from the national library we compiled limit the distribution of each species. We also drew on our own natural history knowledge of each species, and on initial conversations with management practitioners in the regions where these species are impacting ecosystems. We retained predictors for modeling from the national library based on this species-specific information and by removing one of any pair of variables that had a maximum of the Pearson, Spearman, or Kendall correlation coefficient |r|&#x0003e; 0.7 [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] to reduce issues of collinearity. This analysis was accomplished using the <italic>CovariateCorrelationAndSelection</italic> module in SAHM (&#x02018;Final Variable Selection&#x02019;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229253.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Habitat suitability modeling</title><p>We implemented multiple model algorithms for each species since statistical model choice is the greatest source of quantifiable uncertainty in species distribution modeling [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], allowing us to evaluate and reduce the potential biasing effects of algorithm choice on our results. These included Maxent (v 3.4.1), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), Random Forest (RF), Generalized Linear Model (GLM) and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). We used SAHM [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] within the VisTrails software framework [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] to fit models to each combination of algorithm and background method (&#x02018;SAHM Model Fitting&#x02019;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229253.g001">Fig 1</xref>). SAHM provides an established, streamlined and replicable approach to preprocess model inputs, run multiple algorithms and compare results. Three of the five models have an internal variable selection process; BRT used bag fraction = 0.5; GLM used a bidirectional stepwise procedure using Akaike&#x02019;s Information Criterion (AIC), considering all interactions and squared terms; and MARS used Mars Degree (Friedman&#x02019;s &#x003bc;) = 1 and GVL penalty = 2.0. Both Maxent and RF retain all variables provided to them. We used a default set of parameters for each model algorithm, and subsequently evaluated model-specific parameter settings for any resulting model where the training and test area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUC-ROC) values based on 10 fold cross-validation had a difference &#x0003e; 0.05, which we defined <italic>a priori</italic> as a threshold to indicate overfitting along with visual inspection of response curve complexity (e.g.,[<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], &#x02018;Model Overfitting Assessment&#x02019;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229253.g001">Fig 1</xref>). We developed 10 models for each species (five modeling algorithms each with two background sampling approaches) to estimate suitable habitat. Any model that was either still overfit or had poor assessment metrics (i.e., test AUC-ROC &#x0003c; 0.7 [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]) was dropped from further analysis. We produced a multivariate environmental similarity surface (MESS) for each model [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and overlaid this surface on maps to highlight areas of extrapolation beyond the environments captured by the training data. All models were developed using the training data described above and applied to predictors for the contiguous U.S. at a spatial resolution of 90 m.</p><p>Each model was evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation approach [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], which partitions the training data into 10 equal subsets and runs 10 model iterations where 9 subsets are used for model development (training data) and the final subset is used to test the model performance (test data). The 10 iterations are then averaged together to provide a final measure of model performance. SAHM produces several statistical measures (&#x02018;Generate Model Statistics&#x02019;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229253.g001">Fig 1</xref>) including AUC-ROC, AUC-precision recall (AUC-PR), Kappa, True Skill Statistic (TSS), percent correctly classified (PCC), sensitivity, and specificity which we compiled for each model on the training and test data to evaluate performance. These metrics together can help evaluate the quality of a model and generally a model with a test AUC value &#x0003e;0.7 is considered to have good performance and can be useful [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Model outputs and iteration</title><p>Each continuous model was classified to represent suitable and unsuitable habitat using the minimum predicted presence (MPP) threshold, one percentile threshold, ten percentile threshold, and the maximum sensitivity plus specificity (MSS) threshold. Each threshold falls on a spectrum from a more restrictive to more inclusive prediction of habitat suitability. Depending on the intended use of the model, one threshold may be preferred over the other or multiple thresholds may be used to present different representations of habitat suitability for an invasive species [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Therefore, we provide multiple threshold options in our modeling workflow that can be considered by practitioners. The MPP, one percent and ten percent thresholds are determined by the value at which the minimum, lowest one percent or lowest ten percent of the training data occurrences was classified as being in unsuitable, respectively. The MSS threshold is the value of the maximum of the true positive rate (sensitivity) plus the true negative rate (specificity). For statistical evaluations of the models, we used the value at which sensitivity equals specificity. Finally, all ten binary models for each species were combined to create a single, equal weight model ensemble map to represent the number of models predicting suitable habitat for the focal invasive species at a given threshold (&#x02018;Threshold and Ensemble Model Outputs&#x02019;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229253.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Along with these mapped outputs, SAHM produces variable response curves showing the general relationship between each variable and suitability for the species and a measure of variable importance. We evaluated variable importance for each model based on change in the AUC statistic (&#x00394;AUC) when values for that variable were permutated between presence and background, then ranked variables within each model relative &#x00394;AUC.</p><p>Resource managers pointed us to an independent data set to evaluate the fountain grass models in California, CalFlora (accessed 12 December 2018 resulting in 898 cleaned occurrence records not contained in the training occurrence data set [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]). These were used as an independent validation data set for fountain grass to evaluate how many occurrences were captured at each model ensemble value for each threshold and provides a valuable resource to independently validate model performance (&#x02018;Independent Data Evaluation&#x02019;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229253.g001">Fig 1</xref>). We did not have an independent test data set for goutweed. We also categorized the model ensemble for each species using a model assessment rubric to describe each model&#x02019;s attributes related to species data, environmental predictors, modeling process, and model products using three classifications: &#x02018;interpret with caution&#x02019;, &#x02018;acceptable&#x02019;, or &#x02018;ideal&#x02019; following Sofaer et al. [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] who defined criteria to classify each specific attribute of the model process into each of these categories. These classifications are meant to inform use, where different uses may require different levels of classification (e.g., model to guide search to improve model versus a model used for regulatory decisions).</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Case study species</title><p>We selected two invasive species of interest to managers of natural areas: fountain grass (<italic>Pennisetum setaceum</italic> [Forssk.] Chiov.) and goutweed (<italic>Aegopodium podagraria</italic> L.). Fountain grass is a perennial C4 bunch grass native to North Africa and the Middle East, but has been widely planted as an ornamental in the U.S. and has expanded into natural areas [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].

Fountain grass has been established since the 1940s [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] but continues to expand into new environments where local early detection and rapid-response efforts can reduce the rate of spread, achieve local containment, or reduce impacts [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p><p>Goutweed (or Bishop&#x02019;s weed) is a creeping, ornamental herbaceous perennial from Europe that can grow up to 1 m tall.

the local extent model ensemble predictions, Joshua Tree National Park contains a predicted 204,957 ha of fountain grass suitable habitat (64% of the park; calculated using the one percentile threshold and including any location where at least half the models agreed it was suitable). There are several known occurrence points, most of which are in the western portion of the park (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229253.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Discussions with park staff revealed a new population found within the middle of the park occurred in predicted suitable habitat from the model ensemble. Portions of the remote eastern portion of the park, which has not been surveyed, contain suitable habitat as well, and managers discussed wanting to prioritize surveys in those locations after viewing the mapped predictions. Within Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, there are an estimated 18,185 ha of suitable habitat (61% of the park). Two of the known occurrence points occur within the park boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229253.g002">Fig 2</xref>).

These models provide an entry point for an iterative modeling workflow. The methodology is built on readily available occurrence information and environmental variables covering the contiguous U.S. to provide efficiencies in developing large numbers of species-specific models. Using these inputs with the methodology provides a consistent modeling approach for multiple species that can be reviewed and compared. Similar frameworks for invasive species have been suggested however they are often conceptual, have limited human input or suggest the development of multiple models across spatial scales [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Sofaer et al. [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] identified the development of credible and repeatable models as an important issue limiting the use of species distribution models, and this framework provides a credible process as illustrated in the evaluation table (<xref rid="pone.0229253.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) and outputs such as response curves for expert review that are easily repeatable (Table B and Figure A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0229253.s001">S1 File</xref>). This framework also supports iterative modeling, as input from users on environmental variables or new data can be readily incorporated to produce new model versions [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In addition, data quality is the fundamental driver of model quality which is why we gathered presence information from multiple sources and subjected them to rigorous, but generally automated, filtering [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. As model outputs are shared with local practitioners, additional presence locations may become available for use in subsequent iterations. We considered alternative assumptions about the available environment related to invader spread (weighting points farther from others more [KDE] or basing weights solely on density of sampling [target]), corresponding to different sets of background locations [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].

At the national extent, these models show the current status or scope of the problem across the nation, highlighting regions of invasion or potential invasion that may be geographically distant from one another. For example, fountain grass is known to be a problematic invader in the west; however, the national model shows that the southeast portion of the country could also be susceptible to invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229253.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Interpreting the models at the national scale assesses the species&#x02019; impact across very different ecological regions of the country and the risk of invasion could be overlooked if the model was not developed at the national scale [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These models can also be interpreted regionally to assess the potential for invasion in the context of multiple land ownerships and uses. At the regional level, we identified multiple national parks that have not detected the invasive species of concern but likely have suitable habitat based on our model predictions (Tables <xref rid="pone.0229253.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0229253.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The use of the model at this regional extent can assess the level of risk of an invader by evaluating the potential suitable habitat for a management area as it relates to the proximity to the closest known occurrence based on the data used to develop the model [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Finally, at the local extent, these models can be used to guide early detection and rapid-response (EDRR) or control efforts. Model results can be viewed within administrative boundaries and at a resolution of 90 m, providing enough detail for managers to guide surveys to local incipient populations and to target control actions towards locations that will contribute to containment or impact reduction [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p><p>We developed our models with Sofaer et al.&#x02019;s [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] model assessment rubric in mind and evaluated our models using this framework (<xref rid="pone.0229253.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Our models consistently scored in the &#x02018;acceptable practices&#x02019; category with a few metrics scoring as &#x02018;ideal&#x02019; (&#x02018;interpretation support products&#x02019; and &#x02018;reproducibility&#x02019;) and two as &#x02018;interpret with caution&#x02019; (&#x02018;model review&#x02019; for goutweed and &#x02018;iterative&#x02019; for both; the latter is by design as we were interested in defining an entry point for iterative modeling). For many models, it would be impossible to score &#x02018;ideal&#x02019; using readily available data rather than data collected based on a statistically designed study for the specific species. The &#x02018;interpret with caution&#x02019; categories could move to &#x02018;acceptable practices&#x02019; with a second iteration. As the model results are evaluated and used in the field, additional data will be provided and practitioners and experts will also have an opportunity to review and evaluate the model results. Further, our model results provide a ranking of the environmental variable contribution to the model combined with figures of the response curves (Table B and Figure A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0229253.s001">S1 File</xref>). Compiling and presenting these results not only inform the modelers what factors may be important and how the species may respond to those factors but also serve as an important resource for practitioners and species experts to evaluate the model credibility. This can provide another aspect of model validation or enable model iteration and improvement.</p><p>As the practice of modeling habitat suitability evolves and expands, challenges arise with how much of the process can be automated versus which areas need human intervention. There is a desire to develop habitat suitability models for collections of species using similar methods to support a number of initiatives [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In the development of our framework, we included places in the model process for human input. We found the estimation, prediction, pre- and post-processing of models can be automated reasonably well. We built in automation of the occurrence data processing, model input data preprocessing (via SAHM) and model product development while having human intervention at key steps such as environmental variable selection for each species and examination of model parameters to determine overfitting and ecoplausibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229253.g001">Fig 1</xref>). By using SAHM as opposed to keeping the scripting in R, we are able to take advantage of the well-developed graphical user interface for the human inputs of variable selection and examining model outputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229253.g001">Fig 1</xref>). In addition, SAHM has a more efficient and robust method for model tracking and documentation [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. We developed this approach with the understanding that human time and knowledge are valuable, whereas computing time and power are now readily available [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Humans provide judgment, adaptability, motivation, and can draw on experiences while automation can improve consistency, speed, and advanced computation [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. This combination provides the speed and consistency of automation while incorporating the species-specific tailoring of human knowledge and critical junctures in the modeling process.</p><p>A key aspect in our approach is a framework for iterative modeling in which use of the model will improve future versions (&#x02018;Expert Review&#x02019; and &#x02018;Model Application&#x02019; feed back into model development, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229253.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Iterative modeling provides an opportunity to develop a suite of necessarily imprecise models for multiple species and improve models through their use. Models can undergo a new iteration upon the collection of new occurrence data, new environmental variables or from the review of the response curves and spatial results from experts. For example, as remote sensing technology improves spatial resolution and coverage, these new environmental data can be incorporated into the environmental variable library to provide additional predictive power that has been shown to effectively map invasive spices populations in localized examples [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. As shown with gypsy moth, operational iterative modeling can improve models over time and lead to better informed management actions [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Our models represent the first iteration of these predictions. Future versions will need to be determined based on the frequency and quality of incoming data or expert review. Iterative monitoring and modeling are essential to continually improving models to inform decisions and management actions [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. For example, model-informed decision-making that includes surveys for new populations can be used to assess model performance and the information gathered can be included in iterative model updates.</p><p>There are many pitfalls, assumptions, and caveats of correlative species distribution models [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] that are evaluated in <xref rid="pone.0229253.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Despite these caveats, species distribution models can be useful in informing management activities (see examples in [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]). We addressed the primary challenges we identified as impacting distribution modeling. We incorporated multiple factors that may control species distribution at different scales, moving beyond strictly climate envelopes. This suite covers a range of categories of predictor type and included the best available resolutions for nationally consistent data. Since our scope was limited to plants, we created a suite of common distributional drivers that drive many invasive plant species&#x02019; distribution while also moving beyond readily available bioclimatic variables [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, this suite could easily be augmented to include variables that would also be applicable to other taxonomic groups. We used aggregated occurrence data and accounted for potential biases in two different ways to overcome limitations in available data. Our framework allows for the flexibility to include other background selection approaches that have been recently proposed (e.g.,[<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]) in this process if they demonstrate improvements to the modeling process. These products could be used to develop sampling schemes that could provide more information to improve models in the future [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Finally, we use model ensembles to encompass uncertainty among algorithms, and visualize response curves to assess overfitting and ecoplausibility and compare among models [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>Our methodology and results present and demonstrate an approach to develop and use national-scale invasive species habitat suitability models that support multi-scale interpretation that can support multiple uses and audiences. We provide a framework that leverages the skills of modeling experts, the species-specific knowledge from field managers and researchers, and a process for iterative modeling. We use readily available occurrence and national extent environmental variable data to develop invasive species suitability models that are grounded in acceptable practices for species distribution modeling [<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0229253.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Future development should focus on application of the framework to other invasive plant species, implementation of the iterative process, and delivery of model results to practitioners. The model results are seamless across the continental U.S. and can easily be applied to other species of interest. Once the framework has been applied to a large set of species, the set of model results can be combined to identify potential hot spots of invasion or efficiencies in management across species (e.g., single crew targeting multiple species in an area). A key step is to provide a mechanism to easily transfer the results from this methodology to managers making decisions at these different geographic extents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0229253.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Supplementary material that includes environmental variables considered for invasive habitat suitability modeling (Table A), the percent contribution of each environmental variable by model for fountain grass and goutweed (Table B), environmental response curves for fountain grass and goutweed final habitat suitability models (Figure A), and model performance metrics for fountain grass and goutweed (Table C).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0229253.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank the National Park Service Exotic Plant Management Team Units for their contributions to this work.
