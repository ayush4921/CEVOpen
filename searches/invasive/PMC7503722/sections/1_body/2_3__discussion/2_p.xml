<p>Plants express several RBOHs, which are all involved in ROS production although their cellular distribution and expression vary under different conditions [

 <xref rid="B49-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. OsRBOHB localizes in the plasma membrane and functions in the ROS burst during pathogen invasion [
 <xref rid="B50-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In the present study, 
 <italic>OsRBOHB</italic> expression increased only during the incompatible interaction, indicating that virulent pathogen inhibited 
 <italic>OsRBOHB</italic> expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-06196-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). 
 <italic>OsRBOHB</italic> was strongly expressed in incompatible rice cells, which ensures abundant ROS accumulation to defend against infection by avirulent pathogens. Our previous study demonstrated that ROS accumulated more strongly around invasive hyphae during the avirulent 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> invasion of rice cells [
 <xref rid="B20-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, little is known about the microscopic changes of OsRBOHB distribution that occur during pathogen invasion. We showed that OsRBOHB was evenly distributed throughout the plasma membrane during pathogen-free or compatible rice–
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> interactions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-06196-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). By contrast, high OsRBOHB protein levels strongly accumulated around invasive hyphae and partially localized to the plasma membrane during incompatible rice–
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> interactions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-06196-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). Later, ROS distribution matched with the localization of OsRBOHB:eGFP protein around the primary invasive hyphae. It indicated that the OsRBOHBs around the penetration site were functional and effective in inhibiting 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> hyphal growth and development by facilitating focal accumulation of high ROS.
