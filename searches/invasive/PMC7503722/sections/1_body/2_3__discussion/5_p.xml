<p>We found that ROS focally accumulated around invasive hyphae during incompatible riceâ€“
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> interactions and suppressed effector BAS4:eGFP expression (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-06196-f005">Figure 5</xref>). In a previous study, the invasive hyphae of avirulent 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> appeared thin and elongated with almost no branches until HR cell death occurred. By contrast, virulent 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> actively colonize rice cells with bulbous hyphae that have multiple branches and invade surrounding cells during successful infections [

 <xref rid="B28-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In the present study, the invasive hyphae of avirulent 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> appeared thin and filamentous (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-06196">Figure S1</xref>), consistent with the previous study. Dosage-dependent DPI treatments during incompatible interactions recovered 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> hyphal growth and BAS4:eGFP effector expression (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-06196">Figure S3A,B</xref>). These results suggest that ROS focal accumulation by OsRBOHB can inhibit 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> invasion and suppress effector BAS4 expression. Furthermore, most of the protein biosynthesis including BAS4 might be halted under strong focal ROS accumulation condition resulting in suppression of IH growth and disappearance of BAS4:eGFP in incompatible interaction. However, the occurrence of HR cell death under ROS focal accumulation means that effectors expression is not completely inhibited, but rather suppressed below the level of disease development. The avirulent 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> induced HR did not occur in rice cells treated with DPI (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-06196-f004">Figure 4</xref>), probably because pathogen effectors were expressed normally and were transferred into invading cells in the ROS-free environment.
