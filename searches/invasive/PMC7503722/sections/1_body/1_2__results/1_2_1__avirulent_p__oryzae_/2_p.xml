<p>OsRBOHB is distributed in the plasma membrane of rice cells [
 <xref rid="B35-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and involves in ROS burst by receiving NADPH from the intracellular OsNADP-malic enzyme during pathogen infection [
 <xref rid="B24-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. OsRBOHB:GFP was delivered into rice cells to examine the distribution of OsRBOHB after infection with 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic>. OsRBOHB was evenly distributed in plasma membrane of HY sheath epidermal cells after mock treatment and inoculation with virulent 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> PO6-6 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-06196-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). By contrast, the invasion of avirulent 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> INA168 in HY epidermal cells induced the specific localization of OsRBOHB:GFP around the invasive hyphae (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-06196-f001">Figure 1</xref>B), specifically localized in the front part of the invasive hyphae (primary hyphae), not in entire invasive hyphae. This change in protein localization may be a type of defense response in which OsRBOHB only accumulates focally around invasive mycelium during avirulent 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> INA168 interactions. This unique distribution pattern of OsRBOHB ensures high concentration ROS accumulation at the site of invading hyphae rather than diffusion throughout the cell.
