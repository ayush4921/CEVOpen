 <xref rid="B34-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We compared 
 <italic>OsRBOHB</italic> expression and protein localization patterns during 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> infection in compatible and incompatible interactions. 
 <italic>OsRBOHB</italic> expression in incompatible rice cv. HY sheath epidermal cells increased gradually after inoculation with avirulent 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> INA168, and reached the highest level at 18 h post inoculation (hpi) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-06196-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). Even though it started to decrease after 18 hpi, the expression level was still significantly higher than the normal condition. By contrast, inoculation of virulent 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> PO6-6 in HY sheath epidermal cells resulted in continuous lower 
 <italic>OsRBOHB</italic> expression levels than that under normal conditions (
