<p>Penetration of virulent 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> hyphae into rice tissue invaginates the plasma membrane, and the invading hyphae expand within the first occupied epidermal rice cell, thereby perturbing plant hormone signaling before invading surrounding cells [

 <xref rid="B37-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. To analyze ROS accumulation, ROS quantity and distribution were detected in rice cells during compatible and incompatible interactions with 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic>. This study used CM-H
 <sub>2</sub>DCFDA staining to determine the ROS distribution in living cells without damaging the cell structure (which is a potential problem with 3,3â€²-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining). The green fluorescence was produced by ROS reaction with CM-H
 <sub>2</sub>DCFDA in plant cells, but not the autofluorescence of plant phenolic compounds or cell-wall appositions around the invasive hyphae (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-06196">Figure S1</xref>). And it was concentrated around the primary invasive hyphae in HY sheath cells infected with avirulent 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> INA168, whereas the DAB method uniformly stained ROS throughout infected cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-06196-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). Higher levels of ROS were produced in HY cells during incompatible interactions with 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> INA168 than by compatible interactions with 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> PO6-6 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-06196-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). Invasive mycelial growth in rice cells infected with avirulent 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> was inhibited under high ROS conditions. Avirulent 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> invasive hyphae displayed growth inhibition, appearing thin and filamentous and without bulbous branches (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-06196-f002">Figure 2</xref>A and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-06196">Figure S2</xref>). By contrast, no ROS was detected by DAB staining or CM-H
 <sub>2</sub>DCFDA staining in compatible rice cells, and invasive hyphae grew actively, developed strong bulbous hyphae, and successfully colonized infected cells and neighbor cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-06196-f002">Figure 2</xref>A and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-06196">Figure S2</xref>). These results indicate that ROS focal accumulation around invasive hyphae has an essential role in rice immunity through growth inhibition of 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> invasive hyphae.
