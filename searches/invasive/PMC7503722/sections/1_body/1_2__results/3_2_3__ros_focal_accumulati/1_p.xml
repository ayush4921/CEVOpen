 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> hyphae secrete effectors that suppress plant defense responses for successful colonization in rice cells [

 <xref rid="B39-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. If ROS focal accumulation inhibits 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> hyphal growth and inhibits effector expression, it would be a much more effective defense mechanism. To investigate effector expression during 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> infection process, the effector BAS4:eGFP was constructed and transformed into 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> INA168. The BAS4:eGFP effector was normally expressed in 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> invasive hyphae in compatible interaction with NB sheath epidermal cells (

 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> INA168: BAS4:eGFP (
