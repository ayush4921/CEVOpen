<p>The effect of ROS accumulation on BAS4:eGFP effector expression was observed using CellROX staining, which produces red fluorescence when it reacts with ROS in infected living cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-06196-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). In the compatible interaction, BAS4:eGFP expression occurred normally in the invasive hyphae of 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic>, but no BAS4:eGFP fluorescence was detected in the incompatible interaction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-06196-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). Only red fluorescence from reaction with ROS was observed around the invasive hyphae of avirulent 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> INA168:BAS4:eGFP, but not green fluorescence from BAS4:eGFP, indicating that ROS accumulation around invasive hyphae suppressed BAS4:eGFP expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-06196-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). ROS quantification data confirmed that ROS production in incompatible HY cells was much higher than in compatible NB cells after inoculation with 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> INA168 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-06196-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). These combined results indicated that ROS focal accumulation around avirulent 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> invasive hyphae suppressed effector BAS4 expression.
