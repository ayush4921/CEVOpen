<p>Cytochalasin inhibits actin microfilament polymerization that is required for intracellular vesicle trafficking in plants, and Cytochalasin E (Cyt E) treatment suppresses iron-dependent ROS accumulation in rice sheaths during avirulent 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> infection [

 <xref rid="B43-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. We investigated whether Cyt A affects ROS focal accumulation and HR cell death in HY sheath cells during avirulent 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> INA168 infection. In incompatible interaction with 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> INA168, ROS focally accumulated around the invasive hyphae and strong HR cell death occurred in HY cells. By contrast, ROS focal accumulation disappeared after Cyt A treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-06196-f005">Figure 5</xref>A), and incompatible HY cells did not develop normal HR responses to avirulent 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-06196-f005">Figure 5</xref>A,D). At the same time, the growth of invasive hyphae and BAS4:eGFP effector expression in avirulent 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> INA168:BAS4:eGFP was restored (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-06196-f005">Figure 5</xref>B), and the pathogen successfully colonized rice cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-06196-f005">Figure 5</xref>D). ROS quantification data showed that ROS production in HY cells slightly decreased after Cyt A treatment, but did not significantly differ from that in mock (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-06196-f005">Figure 5</xref>C). These combined results indicated that Cyt A treatment suppressed ROS focal accumulation around invasive hyphae and restored pathogen effector BAS4 expression to establish compatibility against avirulent 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> infection.
