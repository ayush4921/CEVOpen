<p>This study examined the spatiotemporal production of ROS during incompatible interactions. We report that ROS focally accumulated around invasive 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> hyphae in rice cells during incompatible riceâ€“
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> interactions. 
 <italic>OsRBOHB</italic> expression levels strongly increased and OsRBOHB protein localized around invasive hyphae only during incompatible interactions. Distinct localization of OsRBOHB around the infection site was correlated to ROS accumulation around invasive hyphae and inhibited effector BAS4 expression during incompatible interactions. ROS focal accumulation completely disappeared in the presence of the specific RBOH inhibitor DPI. Cytochalasin A also inhibited ROS accumulation around incompatible 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> invasive hyphae. By contrast, ROS focal accumulation around invasive hyphae did not occur during compatible interactions. These combined results suggest that altered localization of OsRBOHB at the infection sites enables high concentration of ROS to accumulate around the avirulent 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> invasive hyphae during incompatible interactions, which can prevent the expression and secretion of pathogen effector BAS4 and promote rice immunity.
