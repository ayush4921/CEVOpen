<p>Plant pathogens have developed numerous direct and indirect effectors that suppress ROS production to maintain pathogenicity through long time coevolution [
 <xref rid="B24-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Several fungal pathogens secrete extracellular catalase on the mycelial surface during host invasion, which detoxifies ROS produced by host cells [

 <xref rid="B25-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Analysis of plant cell membranes during mycelial invasion proved that invasive hyphae penetrating the cell were sealed within extra-invasive hyphal membrane (EIHM) derived from host cell, and were not in direct contact with the intracellular matrix [
 <xref rid="B26-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Previous studies showed that biotrophy-associated secreted (BAS) proteins were highly expressed during compatible interactions, but suppressed during incompatible interactions. BAS1 and BAS2 proteins accumulated in biotrophic interfacial complexes (BIC), BAS3 localized in BICs and penetration sites, and BAS4 distributed evenly along the invasive hyphae [

 <xref rid="B29-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, fungal effector secretion and translocation to plant cells remains largely unknown due to lack of functional studies. And more information should be provided to explain plant defense mechanisms on suppressing pathogen virulence.
