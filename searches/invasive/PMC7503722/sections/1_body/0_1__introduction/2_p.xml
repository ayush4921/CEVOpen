<p>Plant respiratory burst oxidase homologue (RBOHs) are involved in ROS generation and innate immunity [
 <xref rid="B16-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It has been reported that at least 11 genes encoded 
 <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> respiratory burst oxidase homologue (OsRBOH) proteins in the rice genome, and 
 <italic>OsRBOH</italic> genes were differentially expressed depending on the rice tissue and environmental stresses [

 <xref rid="B19-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The localizations and enzyme activities of OsRBOH proteins affect ROS distribution during defense responses. The RBOHs inhibitor DPI significantly inhibited ROS generation in rice cells under biotic and abiotic stresses [

It has been proved that reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) complex associates/co-localizes with actin in animal cells, and the actin cytoskeleton has an important role in facilitating NOX enzyme activation at distinct cellular locations to induce focused ROS generation [
