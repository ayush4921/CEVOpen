<p>Plant pathogen effectors facilitate parasitism by suppressing pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) perception or modifying plant physiology to support pathogen growth and colonization [

 <xref rid="B2-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While, plant resistance is determined by immune receptors that recognize appropriate ligands to activate defense [
 <xref rid="B4-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], such as PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI) [
 <xref rid="B5-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These two types of plant immune responses suppress pathogen infection and ultimately protect the plant through hypersensitive response (HR)-mediated cell death [
 <xref rid="B9-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. ROS burst which can be triggered by PTI and ETI [
 <xref rid="B10-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], is related to the establishment of disease resistance [
 <xref rid="B11-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The functions of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plant defense include acting as a toxic chemical against pathogens, enhancing host physical resistance by strengthening cell walls [

 <xref rid="B13-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], mediating defense gene activation, and activating HR cell death [

 <xref rid="B15-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, further work is necessary to completely define the additional roles of ROS in plant defense mechanisms and development processes.
