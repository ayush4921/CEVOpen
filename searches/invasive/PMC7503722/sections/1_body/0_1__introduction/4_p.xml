<p>The interaction between rice and 
 <italic>Pyricularia oryzae (P. oryzae)</italic> is a useful model system to examine the pathogenicity and immune responses between fungal pathogens and host plants. Incompatible rice plants produce apoplastic ROS bursts as the immediate defense response against 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> infection [

 <xref rid="B30-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Sustained ROS production can effectively inhibit 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> infection through HR-mediated cell death [

 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> does not induce ROS accumulation at the plasma membrane or around invasive hyphae [
 <xref rid="B20-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Recent study found that an iron- and ROS-dependent ferroptotic cell death occurs during an incompatible riceâ€“
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> interaction, which shared in plants and animals is strong enough to halt or kill pathogens [
