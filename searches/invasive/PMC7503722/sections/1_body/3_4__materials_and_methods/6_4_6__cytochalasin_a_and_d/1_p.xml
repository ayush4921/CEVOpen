<p>To suppress the production and focal accumulation of ROS in 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic>-infected rice cells, Cyt A (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and DPI (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) treatments were performed as described previously with slight modification [
 <xref rid="B20-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Briefly, 41.8 µM of Cyt A or different concentrations (1, 3, 5 µM) of DPI were mixed with the freshly harvested spore suspension (5.0 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) of 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> INA168. The Cyt A- or DPI-treated spores were inoculated into rice leaf sheaths (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4) along with untreated spores (Mock). The effects of Cyt A and DPI were observed at 48 hpi using fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss equipped with Axioplan 2; Campbell, CA, USA).
