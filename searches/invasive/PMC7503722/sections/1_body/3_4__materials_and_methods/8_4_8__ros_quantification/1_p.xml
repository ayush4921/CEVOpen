<p>ROS was quantified by performing a chemiluminescence assay [
 <xref rid="B20-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Rice sheaths (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4) were inoculated with freshly harvested spore suspensions of 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic>. At 48 hpi, the inoculated rice epidermal layers were cut into small pieces (0.5 × 0.2 cm) and submerged in Milli-Q water for 5 min at 4 °C to reduce wound-induced ROS. Each epidermal sample (0.5 × 0.2 cm) was transferred into 96-well plates containing 100 mL luminol buffer [30 µL luminol (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), 1 µL horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA, USA), and 69 µL Milli-Q water], incubated for 5 min in the dark, and ROS was detected by luminometer under dark condition.
