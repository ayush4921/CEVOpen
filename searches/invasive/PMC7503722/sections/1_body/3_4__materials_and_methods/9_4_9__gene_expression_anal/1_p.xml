<p>Leaf sheaths of rice cv. HY (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4) inoculated with different 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> spore suspensions were sampled at different time points (0, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 hpi). RNA extraction was performed using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Then, 2 µg of RNA was used to synthesize first-strand cDNA in 20 µL total reaction mixture using cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 
 <italic>OsRBOHB</italic> expression was determined using 1 µg cDNA and Real-Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (Real-time qRT-PCR, Stratagene, Mx3000p, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The qRT-PCR assay was performed using TOPreal qPCR 2 × PreMIX (SYBR Green with low ROX, Enzynomics, Daejon, South Korea) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The 
 <italic>Ubiquitin</italic> (LOC_Os06g46770) transcript level was used to normalize the 
 <italic>OsRbohB</italic> transcript level. Relative gene expression level was determined by comparing with the mock sample at 0 hpi. The primers used in this study are listed in
