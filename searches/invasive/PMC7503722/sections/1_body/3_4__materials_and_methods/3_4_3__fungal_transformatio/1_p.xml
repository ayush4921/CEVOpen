<p>The pBV551 plasmid containing the BAS4:eGFP cassette was provided by the Center for Fungal Genetic Resources (Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea; 
 <uri xlink:href="http://genebank.snu.ac.kr" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://genebank.snu.ac.kr</uri>). The BAS4:eGFP:pBV551 contains the 
 <italic>hygromycin B</italic> phosphotransferase gene as a selection marker and the enhanced GFP (eGFP) gene for labeling transformants. The BAS4:eGFP cassette was transformed into 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> INA168 by performing polyethylene glycol (PEG)-mediated protoplast transformation as described previously [
 <xref rid="B30-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Briefly, 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> INA168 mycelia were cultured in broth medium (1 g sucrose, 0.6 g yeast extract, and 0.6 g casamino acid in 100 mL) for 3 d, and then all mycelia were incubated with 5 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> Lysing Enzymes (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 3–4 h using a platform shaker under room temperature. Then, 10 µg plasmid BAS4:eGFP:pBV551 was transformed into freshly harvested 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> mycelial protoplasts (1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) as described previously [
 <xref rid="B30-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Positive transformants were selected on TB3 agar medium supplemented with hygromycin B (20 g sucrose, 0.3 g yeast extract, 0.3 g casamino acid, 1 g glucose, 0.8 g agar, and 0.2 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> hygromycin B in 100 mL), and confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using BAS4:eGFP primers. The primers used in this study are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-06196">Table S1</xref>. The positive fungal transformants were confirmed by visualizing eGFP fluorescence using a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss equipped with Axioplan 2; Campbell, CA, USA) with GFP filter (488 nm excitation/505–550 nm emission).
