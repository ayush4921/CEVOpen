<p>ROS accumulation in 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic>-infected rice epidermal cells was detected using 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester (CM-H

 <xref rid="B75-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Rice leaf sheaths (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4) were inoculated with different 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> strains, and then incubated in the dark for 36 h at 25 °C. The isolated rice epidermal layer was first soaked in water for 5 min at 4 °C to reduce wound-induced ROS, followed by staining with 2 µM CM-H
 <sub>2</sub>DCFDA or 5 µM CellROX deep red reagent in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. The stained epidermis was washed three times with 1× PBS buffer for 5 min, and the cells were observed using fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss equipped with Axioplan 2; Campbell, CA, USA) with bright field and green fluorescence filter (488 nm excitation/505–550 nm emission) to detect CM-H
 <sub>2</sub>DCFDA stained cells. Cells stained with CellROX deep red reagent were observed using confocal laser microscopy (Leica, TCS SP5, Mannheim, Germany) with bright field and red fluorescence filter (644 nm excitation/665 nm emission).
