 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> (INA168, INA168:BAS4:eGFP, and PO6-6) was inoculated onto 4–5 cm rice leaf sheaths (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4) from 5–6-week old rice cv. NB and HY. The inoculated rice leaf sheaths were incubated at 25 °C in the dark for 48 h in a moistened chamber. The infection phenotype was determined in isolated chlorophyll-free thin epidermal layer using fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss equipped with Axioplan 2; Campbell, CA, USA) with bright field. The infected cells were categorized into two phenotypes: cells with invasive hyphae (IH) and cells with dead hyphae/hypersensitive response (HR). The infection assay and quantification of infected cells were performed at least three times with similar results.
