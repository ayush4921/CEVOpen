<p>The 
 <italic>OsRBOHB</italic> (LOC_Os01g25820) coding region was amplified from a rice cDNA library with gene-specific primers containing 
 <italic>Eco</italic>R1 and 
 <italic>Xba</italic>1 adapter sites. The primers used in this study are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-06196">Supplemental Table S1</xref>. The PCR product was ligated to pBlueScript II SK (pBSK) and transferred into the destination vector pCAMBIA1304 tagged with GFP. The final clone was confirmed by digestion and nucleotide sequencing (Macrogen, Seoul, Korea).
