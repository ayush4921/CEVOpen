<p>Subcellular localization of OsRBOHB in the rice epidermal layer was analyzed using gene gun method as described previously [

 <xref rid="B30-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Briefly, 10 µg OsRBOHB:pCAMBIA1304 plasmid was bombarded into rice sheath epidermal cells placed in Murashige and Skoog medium (2.15 g Murashige and Skoog, 15 g sucrose, and 4 g Gellan gum in 1 l Milli-Q water) using a biolistic particle delivery system (PDS-1000/He™ System, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), followed by incubation at 25 °C for 36 h in the dark. Images were captured using confocal laser microscopy (Leica, TCS SP5, Mannheim, Germany) with bright field and GFP filter (488 nm excitation/505–550 nm emission).
