<p>To detect OsRBOHB localization after pathogen infection, 10 µg OsRBOHB:pCAMBIA1304 plasmid was bombarded into rice sheath epidermal cells as described above, followed by incubation in the dark at 25 °C for 12 h. Freshly harvested 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> INA168/PO6-6 spore suspensions were inoculated on the rice epidermal layer surface, and then incubated for 24 h in the dark at 25 °C. Images were captured using confocal laser microscopy (Leica, TCS SP5, Mannheim, Germany) with GFP filter (Ex/Em: 488 nm/505–550 nm in wave length).
