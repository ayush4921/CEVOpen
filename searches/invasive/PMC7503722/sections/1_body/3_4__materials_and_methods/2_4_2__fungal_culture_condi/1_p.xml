<p>Two strains of the rice blast fungus 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> (INA168 and PO6-6) were obtained from the Center for Fungal Genetic Resources (Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea; 
 <uri xlink:href="http://genebank.snu.ac.kr" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://genebank.snu.ac.kr</uri>). 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> INA168 is avirulent and 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> PO6-6 is virulent to rice cv. HY, whereas rice cv. NB is susceptible to 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> INA168. All fungal strains were stored at −20 °C and cultured on rice bran agar medium [
 <xref rid="B30-ijms-21-06196" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. To produce aerial mycelia and harvest fungal spores, 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> INA168 was grown under continuous light conditions (80 µmol photons m
 <sup>−2</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup>) at 25 °C for 12–14 d, whereas 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> PO6-6 was grown under dark conditions at 25 °C for 12–14 d. Aerial mycelia were collected and sporulation was induced by incubating under continuous light conditions (80 µmol photons m
 <sup>−2</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup>) for 3–4 d. Sterilized water with 0.025% (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to plates to collect the new produced spores, and the spore suspension was adjusted to appropriate concentrations for different experiments.
