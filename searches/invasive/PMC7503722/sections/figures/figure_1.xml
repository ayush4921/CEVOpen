  <p>OsRBOHB- focally accumulated around invasive hyphae during incompatible rice–
   <italic>P. oryzae</italic> interaction. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Transcriptional analysis of 
   <italic>OsRBOHB</italic> in rice leaf sheaths after inoculation with 
   <italic>P. oryzae</italic> incompatible strain INA168 and compatible strain PO6-6. The 
   <italic>OsRBOHB</italic> expression level was detected at different time points using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) after normalizing with respect to the housekeeping gene 
   <italic>Ubiquitin</italic>. The results were presented as means ± SD of relative expression levels from three independent experiments. Letters above the bars indicate significant differences in relative expression at different time points (one-way ANOVA, 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). (
   <bold>B</bold>) Localization of GFP-tagged OsRBOHB in epidermal cells of rice cv. HY after inoculation with 
   <italic>P. oryzae</italic> incompatible INA168 and compatible PO6-6. OsRBOHB:GFP fluorescence is indicated by arrows in rice cells. Scale bars = 10 µm. All images were captured using confocal laser microscopy with bright field or green fluorescence filter (488 nm excitation/505–550 nm emission). BF, bright field; IH, invasive hyphae; PM, plasma membrane.
