 <caption> ROS accumulation in compatible and incompatible rice– P. oryzae interactions. ( A) ROS distribution in HY cells during compatible and incompatible P. oryzae interactions. DAB and CM-H 2DCFDA staining were performed to detect ROS distribution at 48 hpi and 36 hpi. ( B) ROS quantification in HY sheath epidermal cells during compatible and incompatible rice– P. oryzae interactions. ROS was quantified by chemiluminescence assay. Values represent means ± SD of total relative luminescent units (RLU). All images were captured using fluorescence microscopy with bright field or green fluorescence filter (488 nm excitation/505–550 nm emission). BF, bright field; GF, green fluorescence; IH, invasive hyphae. Scale bars = 10 µm. Asterisks indicate significant differences between compatible and incompatible interactions (Student’s t-test, ** p &lt; 0.01, n = 3). </caption>
