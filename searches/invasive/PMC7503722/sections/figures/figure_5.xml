  <p>Cytochalasin A treatment suppressed ROS focal accumulation and restored BAS4 effector expression during incompatible rice–
   <italic>P. oryzae</italic> interactions. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Cyt A treatment suppressed ROS accumulation in rice cv. HY cells inoculated with 
   <italic>P. oryzae</italic> INA168. ROS production and focal accumulation in mock and Cyt A-treated HY leaf sheaths cells were detected by staining with DAB and CM-H
   <sub>2</sub>DCFDA. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Successful expression of BAS4 effector in incompatible INA168:BAS4:eGFP invasive hyphae in Cyt A-treated leaf sheaths of rice cv. HY. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Quantification of ROS production in mock and Cyt A-treated leaf sheath cells of rice cv. HY after inoculation with incompatible 
   <italic>P. oryzae</italic> INA168. ROS was quantified by chemiluminescence assay. Values represent means ± SD of total relative luminescent units (RLU). (
   <bold>D</bold>) Quantification of infection patterns in Cyt A-treated leaf sheath cells of rice cv. HY at 48 hpi with incompatible 
   <italic>P. oryzae</italic> INA168. The percentages of two infection patterns are shown as mean values ± SD, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3 leaf sheaths from different plants. All images were captured using fluorescence microscopy with bright field or green fluorescence filter (488 nm excitation/505–550 nm emission). Scale bars = 10 µm. Asterisks indicate significant differences in infection patterns between mock and Cyt A treatment (Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test, ** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). IH, invasive hyphae; HR, hypersensitive response; GF, green fluorescence; BF, bright field. ns, no significance.
