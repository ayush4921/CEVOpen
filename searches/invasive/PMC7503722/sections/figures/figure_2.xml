  <p>ROS accumulation in compatible and incompatible rice–

   <bold>A</bold>) ROS distribution in HY cells during compatible and incompatible 
   <italic>P. oryzae</italic> interactions. DAB and CM-H
   <sub>2</sub>DCFDA staining were performed to detect ROS distribution at 48 hpi and 36 hpi. (
   <bold>B</bold>) ROS quantification in HY sheath epidermal cells during compatible and incompatible rice–
   <italic>P. oryzae</italic> interactions. ROS was quantified by chemiluminescence assay. Values represent means ± SD of total relative luminescent units (RLU). All images were captured using fluorescence microscopy with bright field or green fluorescence filter (488 nm excitation/505–550 nm emission). BF, bright field; GF, green fluorescence; IH, invasive hyphae. Scale bars = 10 µm. Asterisks indicate significant differences between compatible and incompatible interactions (Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test, ** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3).
