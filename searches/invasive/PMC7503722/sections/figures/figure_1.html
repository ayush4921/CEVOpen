 <caption> OsRBOHB- focally accumulated around invasive hyphae during incompatible rice– P. oryzae interaction. ( A) Transcriptional analysis of OsRBOHB in rice leaf sheaths after inoculation with P. oryzae incompatible strain INA168 and compatible strain PO6-6. The OsRBOHB expression level was detected at different time points using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) after normalizing with respect to the housekeeping gene Ubiquitin. The results were presented as means ± SD of relative expression levels from three independent experiments. Letters above the bars indicate significant differences in relative expression at different time points (one-way ANOVA, p &lt; 0.05, n = 3). ( B) Localization of GFP-tagged OsRBOHB in epidermal cells of rice cv. HY after inoculation with P. oryzae incompatible INA168 and compatible PO6-6. OsRBOHB:GFP fluorescence is indicated by arrows in rice cells. Scale bars = 10 µm. All images were captured using confocal laser microscopy with bright field or green fluorescence filter (488 nm excitation/505–550 nm emission). BF, bright field; IH, invasive hyphae; PM, plasma membrane. </caption>
