  <p>ROS accumulation inhibited the expression of BAS4 effector in 
   <italic>P. oryzae</italic> INA168:BAS4:eGFP invasive hyphae in the incompatible interaction with rice cv. HY. (
   <bold>A</bold>) BAS4 expression and ROS accumulation in leaf sheaths of rice cv. NB and HY during 
   <italic>P. oryzae</italic> INA168:BAS4:eGFP infection. CellROX staining was performed to detect ROS accumulation. Arrow indicates ROS accumulation and BAS4 secretion. All images were captured using confocal laser microscopy with bright field, green fluorescence filter (488 nm excitation/505–550 nm emission), or red fluorescence filter (644 nm excitation/665 nm emission). Scale bars = 10 µm. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Quantification of ROS in leaf sheaths of rice cv. NB and HY during 
   <italic>P. oryzae</italic> INA168 infection. ROS was quantified by chemiluminescence assay. Values represent means ± SD of total relative luminescent units (RLU). Asterisks indicate significant differences among different rice sheaths (Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test, ** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). IH, invasive hyphae.
