 <caption> Cytochalasin A treatment suppressed ROS focal accumulation and restored BAS4 effector expression during incompatible rice– P. oryzae interactions. ( A) Cyt A treatment suppressed ROS accumulation in rice cv. HY cells inoculated with P. oryzae INA168. ROS production and focal accumulation in mock and Cyt A-treated HY leaf sheaths cells were detected by staining with DAB and CM-H 2DCFDA. ( B) Successful expression of BAS4 effector in incompatible INA168:BAS4:eGFP invasive hyphae in Cyt A-treated leaf sheaths of rice cv. HY. ( C) Quantification of ROS production in mock and Cyt A-treated leaf sheath cells of rice cv. HY after inoculation with incompatible P. oryzae INA168. ROS was quantified by chemiluminescence assay. Values represent means ± SD of total relative luminescent units (RLU). ( D) Quantification of infection patterns in Cyt A-treated leaf sheath cells of rice cv. HY at 48 hpi with incompatible P. oryzae INA168. The percentages of two infection patterns are shown as mean values ± SD, n = 3 leaf sheaths from different plants. All images were captured using fluorescence microscopy with bright field or green fluorescence filter (488 nm excitation/505–550 nm emission). Scale bars = 10 µm. Asterisks indicate significant differences in infection patterns between mock and Cyt A treatment (Student’s t-test, ** p &lt; 0.01, n = 3). IH, invasive hyphae; HR, hypersensitive response; GF, green fluorescence; BF, bright field. ns, no significance. </caption>
