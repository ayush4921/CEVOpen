  <p>Inhibition of OsRBOHB by DPI treatment suppressed ROS accumulation and stimulated effector BAS4 expression during incompatible rice–
   <italic>P. oryzae</italic> interactions. (
   <bold>A</bold>) DPI treatment suppressed ROS accumulation in rice cv. HY cells inoculated with 
   <italic>P. oryzae</italic> INA168. DAB and CM-H
   <sub>2</sub>DCFDA staining were performed to detect ROS accumulation in mock and DPI-treated rice cv. HY leaf sheaths. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Effector BAS4 expression of INA168:BAS4:eGFP invasion to DPI-treated leaf sheaths of rice cv. HY. (
   <bold>C</bold>) OsRBOHB expression in DPI-treated leaf sheaths of rice cv. HY inoculated with incompatible 
   <italic>P. oryzae</italic> INA168. OsRBOHB expression at different time points was detected by qRT-PCR after normalizing with respect to the housekeeping gene 
   <italic>Ubiquitin</italic>. Results are presented as means ± SD of the relative quantity from three independent repeats. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Quantification of ROS production in mock and DPI-treated leaf sheath cells of rice cv. HY after inoculation with incompatible 
   <italic>P. oryzae</italic> INA168. ROS production was measured by chemiluminescence assay. Values represent means ± SD of total relative luminescent units (RLU). (
   <bold>E</bold>) Quantification of infection patterns in DPI-treated leaf sheath cells of rice cv. HY at 48 hpi with incompatible 
   <italic>P. oryzae</italic> INA168. The percentages of two infection patterns are shown as mean values ± SD, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3 leaf sheaths from different plants. All images were captured using fluorescence microscopy with bright field or green fluorescence filter (488 nm excitation/505–550 nm emission). Scale bars = 10 µm. Asterisks indicate significant differences (Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test, * 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). IH, invasive hyphae; HR, hypersensitive response; GF, green fluorescence; BF, bright field.
