  <p>Model of ROS focal accumulation–mediated suppression on hyphal invasion and effector expression and secretion in rice–
   <italic>P. oryzae</italic> incompatible interactions. In compatible rice–
   <italic>P. oryzae</italic> interactions, invasive hyphae secrete effectors into the rice cytoplasm to interfere with PRR, MAPK cascades, and OsNADP-ME and OsRBOHB activities. Suppressed OsNADP-ME does not supply electron (e
   <sup>−</sup>) to OsRBOHB, which function in ROS production. However, OsRBOHB is strongly expressed, and many OsRBOHB localize around the invasive hyphae and produce considerable ROS (brown color) during avirulent 
   <italic>P. oryzae</italic> infection. This ROS focal accumulation effectively inhibits invasive hyphal growth and some effector expression and secretion. Effector secretion is blocked in incompatible interactions, but the rarely leaked effectors are recognized by NLR and induce strong HR cell death to eliminate pathogens. PRR, pattern recognition receptors; NLR, nucleotide binding leucine-rich repeat; EIHM, extra invasive hyphal membrane; IH, invasive hyphae.
