 <caption> Inhibition of OsRBOHB by DPI treatment suppressed ROS accumulation and stimulated effector BAS4 expression during incompatible rice– P. oryzae interactions. ( A) DPI treatment suppressed ROS accumulation in rice cv. HY cells inoculated with P. oryzae INA168. DAB and CM-H 2DCFDA staining were performed to detect ROS accumulation in mock and DPI-treated rice cv. HY leaf sheaths. ( B) Effector BAS4 expression of INA168:BAS4:eGFP invasion to DPI-treated leaf sheaths of rice cv. HY. ( C) OsRBOHB expression in DPI-treated leaf sheaths of rice cv. HY inoculated with incompatible P. oryzae INA168. OsRBOHB expression at different time points was detected by qRT-PCR after normalizing with respect to the housekeeping gene Ubiquitin. Results are presented as means ± SD of the relative quantity from three independent repeats. ( D) Quantification of ROS production in mock and DPI-treated leaf sheath cells of rice cv. HY after inoculation with incompatible P. oryzae INA168. ROS production was measured by chemiluminescence assay. Values represent means ± SD of total relative luminescent units (RLU). ( E) Quantification of infection patterns in DPI-treated leaf sheath cells of rice cv. HY at 48 hpi with incompatible P. oryzae INA168. The percentages of two infection patterns are shown as mean values ± SD, n = 3 leaf sheaths from different plants. All images were captured using fluorescence microscopy with bright field or green fluorescence filter (488 nm excitation/505–550 nm emission). Scale bars = 10 µm. Asterisks indicate significant differences (Student’s t-test, * p &lt; 0.01, n = 3). IH, invasive hyphae; HR, hypersensitive response; GF, green fluorescence; BF, bright field. </caption>
