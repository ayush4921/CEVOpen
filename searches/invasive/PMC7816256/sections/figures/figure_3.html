 <caption> Species richness, evenness, Shannon diversity, and inverse Simpson (Simpson −1) diversity for (a) mycorrhizal plant species and (b) non‐mycorrhizal plant species. Points represent plot means for garlic mustard ambient (red circles) and garlic mustard weeded (purple triangles) treatments (2006–2016). Garlic mustard data were excluded from calculation of diversity metrics. Error bars are ±SE. Vertical dashed lines separate pre‐garlic mustard weeded (2006) from post‐garlic mustard weeded time points. The interaction and main effects of garlic mustard treatment and time were nonsignificant for species richness for both mycorrhizal and non‐mycorrhizal plant species. The main effect of garlic mustard treatment was significantly different for evenness, Shannon and inverse Simpson diversity for mycorrhizal plant species, but not the non‐mycorrhizal plant species. Asterisks indicate significant pairwise comparisons at P = 0.05. </caption>
