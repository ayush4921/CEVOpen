<p>In 2006, we began an experimental treatment in five 14 × 14 m replicate plots that were surrounded by 2.5 m tall wire fencing (erected in 2002) to prevent deer access. Each plot was divided into 36, 2 × 2 m subplots. After sampling in 2006, the 18 subplots on the left half of each plot were weeded of all garlic mustard plants and the right half of each plot was not manipulated and remained at ambient levels of garlic mustard invasion. All garlic mustard individuals, including roots, were hand pulled from the weeded side of each plot, bagged, and disposed of off‐site. In every subsequent year, weeding occurred in the spring when garlic mustard germinates and all weeded material was removed from the site. To preclude garlic mustard seed dispersal into the weeded half of each plot, we installed temporary barriers annually just prior to garlic mustard seed dispersal that we removed when seed dispersal was complete. Persistent weeding was an effective method for removing the invader. Garlic mustard relative abundance in ambient plots averaged 15.2% and ranged from 0.5% to 71.6%. After weeding in 2006, garlic mustard abundance averaged 0.08% in the weeded plots due to infrequent late emerging seedlings (Fig.
