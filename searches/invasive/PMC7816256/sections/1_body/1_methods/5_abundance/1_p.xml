<p>We tested for changes in abundance within each functional group (i.e., mycorrhizal status) between garlic mustard ambient and weeded treatments using a generalized linear mixed effects model including the garlic mustard treatment, year, and their interaction as fixed effects. We fit separate models for each functional group, with the summed percent cover of all mycorrhizal species or of all non‐mycorrhizal species, as the response variable, respectively. To control for non‐independence due to repeated sampling of plots over time, we included plot as a random effect. Summed percent cover for each functional group never exceeded 100% so we modeled proportional cover using a beta distribution.</p>
