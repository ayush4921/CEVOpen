<p>We tested for the effects of garlic mustard on community composition for the mycorrhizal and the non‐mycorrhizal plant communities separately because we expected only mycorrhizal plant species to directly respond to garlic mustard removal. We predicted that weeding would affect mycorrhizal plant communities, with increasing dissimilarity between garlic mustard ambient and weeded treatments over time, whereas we did not expect differences between treatments for non‐mycorrhizal plant communities. PERMANOVA is based on the ratio of differences in dissimilarity between vs. within groups (Anderson 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), which we used to compare dissimilarity in composition between ambient and garlic mustard weeded treatments and to test for different trends over time within those treatments. For each plant functional group, we used a PERMANOVA with an interaction between garlic mustard treatment and year of sampling to explain Bray‐Curtis dissimilarities between plant communities in the garlic mustard ambient and garlic mustard weeded treatments. The permutations were constrained within garlic mustard treatment nested within plot nested within year.
