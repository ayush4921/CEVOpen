<p>We assigned a mycorrhizal status (mycorrhizal or non‐mycorrhizal) to each recorded plant species based on available published and unpublished data (Appendix 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>: Table S1 and citations therein). Species that form associations with AM fungi were assigned to the “mycorrhizal” functional group and species that do not form mycorrhizal associations were assigned to the “non‐mycorrhizal” functional group. None of the understory herbaceous species in our study formed mycorrhizal associations with non‐AM fungi (i.e., ectomycorrhizal, ericoid). We excluded species from our analyses with unknown mycorrhizal status. The relative abundance of species with an unknown mycorrhizal status averaged 1.6% of the total abundance. Since we manipulated garlic mustard abundance by weeding one‐half of each plot, garlic mustard was also excluded from all analyses. In total, we were able to evaluate garlic mustard’s effects on 28 plant taxa (19 mycorrhizal, 9 non‐mycorrhizal) across our experimental plots.
