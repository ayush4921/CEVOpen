 <sub>w</sub> in our study is the abundance of the focal species in the garlic mustard weeded treatment, and 
 <italic>B</italic>
 <sub>a</sub> is abundance in the ambient treatment within the same plot. Therefore, any negative RII values (i.e., 
 <italic>B</italic>
 <sub>w</sub>&gt; 
 <italic>B</italic>
 <sub>a</sub>) indicate a negative effect of garlic mustard on abundance, while positive RII values indicate a positive effect. To assess differences in RII, we fit a general linear mixed effects model including the garlic mustard treatment, year, and their interaction as fixed effects and plant species and plot as random effects. We predicted that mycorrhizal plant species would have more negative RII values, as well as a more negative temporal trend in RII than non‐mycorrhizal plant species. RII is only a meaningful metric when abundance is greater than zero in both the presence and absence of the biological interaction, so we only calculated RII when the focal species was present in both treatments for a plot and year (16 mycorrhizal species and 6 non‐mycorrhizal species).
