<p>Weeding garlic mustard from the plots resulted in an overall 19.7% increase in abundance of mycorrhizal plant species relative to those in the ambient treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). In contrast, there was no change in abundance of non‐mycorrhizal species between garlic mustard treatments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). The overall abundance of both mycorrhizal and non‐mycorrhizal species changed over time, but these changes were independent of garlic mustard weeding. There was no significant interaction between garlic mustard treatment and year for abundance of mycorrhizal or non‐mycorrhizal species.
