<p>Within functional group (mycorrhizal status), there was variation in strength and direction of each plant species RII response (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Ten mycorrhizal plant species increased in abundance in garlic mustard weeded vs. ambient treatments resulting in a negative RII, whereas four mycorrhizal species had a positive RII. One non‐mycorrhizal plant species had a higher abundance in garlic mustard weeded vs. ambient plots whereas two non‐mycorrhizal species had a positive RII. There was no effect of year or mycorrhizal status on the effect of garlic mustard (RII).
