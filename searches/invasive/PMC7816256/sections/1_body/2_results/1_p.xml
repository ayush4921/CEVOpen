<p>All analyses were performed with data from years 2006 to 2016. There were no significant differences in composition, diversity or abundance of the mycorrhizal or non‐mycorrhizal plant communities prior to establishment of the garlic mustard ambient and weeded treatments in 2006. These results suggest that the garlic mustard weeded treatment drove any subsequent changes in the mycorrhizal and non‐mycorrhizal plant communities. Since we manipulated the presence of garlic mustard as part of the experimental design, data on garlic mustard abundance were excluded from all analyses. We report the test statistics for the main effects between the garlic mustard treatment and year in Appendix
