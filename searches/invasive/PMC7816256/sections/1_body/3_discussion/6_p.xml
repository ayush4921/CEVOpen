<p>Over the course of this study, we found that the main effect of time on the abundance of both plant communities was significant, but the interactions between the garlic mustard treatment and year were not. The non‐mycorrhizal plant abundance decreased over time in both garlic mustard treatments. Therefore, this decline in non‐mycorrhizal plant abundance cannot be attributable only to the increase in mycorrhizal plant abundance in the garlic mustard weeded treatment. We see similar declines in non‐mycorrhizal plant abundance in other plots at our site that are not protected from deer herbivory by fences (
 <italic>unpublished data</italic>), indicating that exclusion of deer is also not driving the declines in non‐mycorrhizal plant abundance. These results suggest that there are other sources of environmental variability (e.g., annual fluctuations in precipitation patterns) that likely influenced the abundance of both plant community types over time. Despite this, there is a strong signature of the effects of garlic mustard weeding on mycorrhizal plant abundance.
