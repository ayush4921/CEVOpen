<p>Our findings support the utility of our coarse classification into mycorrhizal and non‐mycorrhizal functional groups for anticipating responses to invasions but also highlight limitations in the degree of predictability within ecological communities. In particular, within the mycorrhizal group there was considerable variation in response to garlic mustard (RII) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), such that a simple binary assignment of mycorrhizal status would be insufficient to reliably predict changes in species‐level abundance. Plant species’ dependency on mycorrhizal partners (i.e., biomass response to mycorrhizal colonization) generally falls on a spectrum from highly positive plant biomass responses to mycorrhizal colonization to somewhat negative (Tawaraya 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0066" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>), and variation in dependence of mycorrhizal plants on their fungal partners is known to influence the response of a particular species to mutualism disruption (Stinson et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>, McCary et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). We do not know where our naturally occurring plant species fall along the spectrum of dependency on their mycorrhizal partners, and it is possible that differences among trajectories of the experimental plots in response to garlic mustard weeding (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) arise from variation in the dependency of the mycorrhizal species naturally occurring in those plots. Exploring the factors that may have driven the different trajectories of the unique plant communities in each plot is an important next step in understanding the intricacies of community responses to garlic mustard invasion.
