<p>The shifts in the composition, diversity, and abundance of the mycorrhizal, but not the non‐mycorrhizal, functional group in response to garlic mustard weeding are indicative of mutualism disruption. Other mechanisms of impact, such as direct competition or direct phytotoxicity, would not disproportionately affect species that form mycorrhizal associations. Garlic mustard is a poor direct competitor in its invasive range (Meekins and McCarthy 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>, Bossdorf et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>), and disrupts mycorrhizal mutualisms to indirectly compete against other plants (Brouwer et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>, Hale et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Removal of a competitive dominant plant species from a community is expected to result in an increase in abundance of other community members (MacDougall and Turkington 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>), but unlike mutualism disruption, exploitative competition would not explicitly predict different responses for mycorrhizal and non‐mycorrhizal plants to the removal of a competitor. Since mycorrhizal and non‐mycorrhizal plants differ in their methods of resource acquisition (via roots alone or via fungal partners), they may respond differently to limiting resources under exploitative competition. However, soil resources do not differ between garlic mustard ambient and weeded treatments at our site (Bialic‐Murphy, L. et al. 
 <italic>unpublished manuscript</italic>) and are, therefore, unlikely to cause the trends we observed here. Observed patterns of the plant community response to garlic mustard in our field site are consistent with those predicted by the mechanistic process of mutualism disruption.
