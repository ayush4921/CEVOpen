<p>Here, we exploit the power of this well‐established mechanism of invasion impact to test for a link between mutualism disruption of mycorrhizal plant individuals and community‐level response of the forest understory to garlic mustard invasion. A large portion of the diversity in most Eastern deciduous forests exists in the understory, and these species are also diverse in their mycorrhizal associations (Gilliam

 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), making the forest understory community a highly relevant study system. We present analyses of data collected from a 11‐yr garlic mustard weeding experiment in replicated plots to assess whether garlic mustard differentially impacts native mycorrhizal vs. non‐mycorrhizal herbaceous understory plant species. We ask two questions: (1) Does the release and recovery from garlic mustard invasion (i.e., garlic mustard weeded treatment) differentially affect the community composition and diversity of mycorrhizal and non‐mycorrhizal herbaceous understory plant communities? (2) Are changes in community composition and diversity explained by shifts in abundance of mycorrhizal and non‐mycorrhizal plant species? Based on the mutualism disruption hypothesis, we expect a greater change in the community composition, diversity, and abundance of mycorrhizal plants (i.e., the functional groups most sensitive to garlic mustard’s allelochemicals) than non‐mycorrhizal plants, culminating in a distinct signature of mutualism disruption at the community level.
