<p>Many studies have analyzed spatiotemporal patterns of community change to assess the impacts of an invasive species, but knowledge of the mechanism of impact is indispensable for generalizing individual or species‐level effects to those expected at the community level. Studies of community‐level patterns show that invasions can lead to biotic homogenization across locations (Sax et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>) but rarely reduce local species richness within one location (Powell et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). In addition, invasive species alter community evenness by disproportionately displacing dominant native species (Powell et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>, Pearse et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Yet such patterns do not generally predict which species within the resident community will be most vulnerable to the invader, and thereby reliably link invader impacts at the individual, population, and community levels. In contrast, by understanding mechanisms of impact, we may be able to predict responses across levels of biological organization. For example, by understanding how herbivorous insects identify their host plants, we can anticipate the species‐specific impacts of invasive plants or insects on other trophic levels in the native food web (Pearse and Altermatt

 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Moreover, evolutionary divergence time between native range host tree and invaded range host trees is a strong predictor of high impacts of introduced insects on forests (Mech et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). For trophic interactions (such as herbivory, above), the mechanism of impact is a function of diet, and can be relatively straightforward and consistent across space and time.
