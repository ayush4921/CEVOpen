<p>Biological invasions threaten biodiversity, with broad impacts on the economy, environment, health, and culture. Global meta‐analyses demonstrate that invasive species can have a range of negative impacts that include lower abundance and fitness of native species and altered microbial activity and nutrient availability in invaded sites (Vilà et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0069" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>, Pyšek et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Despite these observed negative consequences, we are still largely unable to predict the potential outcomes of an introduced species prior to its establishment and spread (Ricciardi et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>, Sofaer et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Since the impacts of invasion depend on the interaction of traits of individual invasive species (Gurevitch and Padilla 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>) and traits of the invaded community (Hejda et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>), it is unlikely that a single mechanism will fully explain the impacts of invasion. However, understanding causal mechanisms by which certain types of invasive species exert impacts on species in the resident community can lead to more accurate predictions of where and when negative effects will occur in the invaded range (Levine et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>).
