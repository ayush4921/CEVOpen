<p>Citizen science can generate vast quantities of data and allow projects to take place that would otherwise be logistically unfeasible or cost-prohibitive to conduct. One limiting factor in these studies is how to effectively train participants in an efficient and inexpensive manner. While in-person training is effective, this option may not be realistic or cost effective for large projects that seek data over a vast spatial scale. Encouragingly, we find that remotely administered training via a smartphone app can be effectively employed to train citizen scientists, with video-based training being generally equivalent to in-person training. While further study with larger samples and more species is needed and while further study within different types of project is encouraged, our study suggests that citizen science projects need not be limited by an inability to effectively train participants remotely. Smartphone-based video training can help.</p>
