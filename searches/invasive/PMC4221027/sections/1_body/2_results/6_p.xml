<p>The GLM for the intermediate plant ID experience group found that although those who received video training (cohort 2) had a slightly higher median correct ID rate than those who received text/image training (cohort 3), the difference was not statistically significant (B = 0.12; SE  = 0.41; p = 0.76). Those who received in-person training (cohort 1) however did do significantly better than those receiving text/image training (cohort 3; B = 1.22; SE  = 0.48; p = 0.01) (
