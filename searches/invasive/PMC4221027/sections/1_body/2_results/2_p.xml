<p>Looking at percent correct by individual participants, the ANOVA across all training types reveals that training method does play a significant role in influencing ability to correctly identify invasive plants (F = 3.07; p = 0.05; df = 2). Yet, encouragingly, with all three training types that were studied, volunteers did reasonably well at correct identification (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111433-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Even those who just received text/image training had a mean correct plant identification score of 79%. Those receiving the additional video training had a mean correct ID score of 92%. And those receiving the additional in person training had a mean of 89%. (Note the difference in training type means between

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111433-g002">Figure 2</xref>. The 
 <xref rid="pone-0111433-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> mean is calculated by pooling submissions from all users and then dividing the number of correct submissions by the total number of submissions. Whereas the
