<p>To decouple this interaction, we ran GLMs for each level of plant ID experience with percent correctly identified as the dependent variable and training type as the independent variable. For the plant ID beginner group we found those who received video training (cohort 2) did better than those who received text/image training and the difference was highly significant (B = 2.72; SE  = 0.79; p = 0.0006). Those who received in-person training also did significantly better than those who received text/image training, achieving a perfect 100% correct ID rate (
