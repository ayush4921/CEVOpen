<p>The between group ANOVAs revealed a significant difference between training types. Cohort 2 who received video training did significantly better at plant ID than those in cohort 3 who were taught with just text and images on the app (F = 4.97; p = 0.03; df = 1). Interestingly, although in-person training had a mean correct ID score of 89% compared to 79% for text and image, the ANOVA did not find a statistically significant difference between these training types (F = 2.26; p = 0.14; df = 1). We suspect this is due to high variance from our low sample size of only 14 participants in the in-person cohort 1 group. Finally, we found video training (cohort 2) and in-person training (cohort 1) to be comparable, with no significantly different between these two training groups (F = 0.39; p = 0.54; df = 1).</p>
