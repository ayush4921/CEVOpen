<p>The percent correct by species shows that for all training types there were reasonably high levels of correct submissions (
 <xref rid="pone-0111433-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Multiflora Rose, for example, had almost 100% correct submissions in all three training groups. At the other extreme, exotic honeysuckle seemed to be fairly difficult to identify, regardless of training type, although video (60%) and in-person training (57%) had higher levels of correct submissions than text/image (46%). Looking across all species, in-person (cohort 1) and app-based video training (cohort 2) had a higher percent of correct submissions (92%) compared to the text/image trained users (cohort 3; 81%).
