<p>We next analyzed the data at the individual participant-level. For each participant we divided the number of correct submissions by the total number of submissions, which yielded a percent correct score. We then used one-way analysis of variance (ANOVAs) to look for differences across all training types and also between training types

Because the participant's percent correct scores was sensitive to low numbers of submissions we only used data from participants that submitted 5 or more observations when conducting these ANOVAs. This yielded a total of 56 participants: 14 in the in-person training cohort, 17 in the video training cohort, and 25 in the text and image training cohort.
