<p>We received 534 total submissions from 78 participants: 19 in Cohort 1 (in-person trained), 24 in Cohort 2 (app and video training), and 33 in Cohort 3 (text and image trained group). Although these volunteers were randomly assigned to groups of equal size, the final groups were unbalanced due to participants dropping out of the study. It is likely that the in-person group had the smallest number of participants because of the additional time and effort required to show up for in-person training. One participant was dropped from further analysis because they submitted data from northern Vermont, which was outside our study area of Massachusetts. A second participant was dropped because they only submitted data for non-targeted species for the experiment. One record was dropped from one participant because a picture was not included. We ended up with 529 usable submissions from 76 participants.</p>
