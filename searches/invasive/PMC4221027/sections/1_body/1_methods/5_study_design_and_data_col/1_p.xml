<p>Of the many invasive species found throughout Massachusetts, we limited our experimental study to five common species that represents invasive plant species both relatively easy and difficult to identify. Our assessment of a species difficulty was based on conversations with field biologists at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, examples in the literature for some species 
 <xref rid="pone.0111433-Newman1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, and a survey of University of Massachusetts students in a plant identification course. The easy to identify species were: Japanese knotweed (
 <italic>Fallopia japonica</italic>), autumn olive (
 <italic>Eleagnus umbellata</italic>), and multiflora rose (
 <italic>Rosa multiflora</italic>). The more difficult species were: glossy buckthorn (
 <italic>Alnus frangula</italic>) and exotic honeysuckles (
 <italic>Lonicera spp</italic>). Honeysuckles are actually a group of species in the same genera, but are referred to as a single species here for simplicity.
