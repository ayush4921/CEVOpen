<p>The general inspiration for our study design came from our desire to mimic the experience of actual Outsmart users as closely as possible. After receiving training, we asked participants to use the app from June 1, 2013 through September 30, 2013 and report any suspected occurrences of the five assigned species. We deemed this timeframe to be appropriate as it encouraged as many submissions as possible while limiting potential bias due to seasonal change in plant appearance. Just like a regular Outsmart user, participants in the experiment were allowed to report any sightings, whether they specifically went out looking for the invasive species or if they just happened to notice them while out hiking, walking, or doing other outdoor activities. User submissions were verified as correct or incorrect by Outsmart researchers utilizing the EDDMapS interface.</p>
