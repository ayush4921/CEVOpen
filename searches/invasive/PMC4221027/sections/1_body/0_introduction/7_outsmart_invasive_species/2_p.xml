<p>Invasive species monitoring has been identified as a key realm where citizen science can be employed particularly effectively 
 <xref rid="pone.0111433-Dickinson1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Invasive species can wreak ecological and economic destruction and once established may be impractical or impossible to eradicate 
 <xref rid="pone.0111433-Lodge1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Thus, as researchers have identified “Monitoring programs aimed at detecting low-density ‘founder’ populations can play a critical role in slowing or even stopping the spread of harmful invasive species by identifying recently established populations that can be targeted for control and/or eradication” (

 <xref rid="pone.0111433-Lodge1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>). Yet, like other citizen science programs, one hurdle that the Outsmart project faced was how to train participants distributed across New England. To test the effectiveness of remote training, we developed in-person training sessions, training videos, and text/images and conducted a study asking participants to identify five invasive plant species in Massachusetts over the course of the late summer and early fall 2013.
