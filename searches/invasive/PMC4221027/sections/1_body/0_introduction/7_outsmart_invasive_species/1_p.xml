<p>We conducted our experimental study in the context of the Outsmart Invasive Species Project (Outsmart). Outsmart is a collaboration between the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (MA DCR) and the Center for Invasive Species and Ecosystem Health at the University of Georgia. The project aims to strengthen ongoing invasive species monitoring efforts by enlisting help from citizens across New England (Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine), with a particular focus on Massachusetts. Volunteers are asked to identify and report data on invasive plants and insects in their own time and submit data via a free account through the Early Detection and Distribution Mapping System (EDDMapS) website (
