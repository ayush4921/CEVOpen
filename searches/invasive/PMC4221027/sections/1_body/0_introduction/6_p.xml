<p>To address this gap, we analyze three training models. In one scenario we call “Cohort 1: In-person training”, participants are provided in-person training along with app-based videos and app-based text/images. In the second scenario, what we call “Cohort 2: Video-training”, participants are given no in-person training, but receive app-based video and app-based text/image training. In the third scenario, what we call the “Cohort 3: Text/Image only training”, participants only receive app-based text/image training (no video or in-person training). We hypothesized that Cohort 1 (in-person training) would be the most successful at invasive plant identification, followed by Cohort 2 (video-training), and finally Cohort 3 (text/image).</p>
