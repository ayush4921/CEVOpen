<p>Finally, the advanced plant ID experience group had results that we expected. Regardless of training type they all had median plant ID scores of 100% correct (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111433-g003">Figure 3</xref>). This is logical considering people that already possessed advanced plant ID experience weren′t influenced by training, since they likely already knew how to identify the targeted species. One interesting aspect of this group however is the large variance in the in-person training cohort, where some people that self-identified as “advanced” actually did quite poorly at plant ID. We are calling this phenomena the “overly confident” or “arrogance” factor, meaning it appears some participants incorrectly thought they already knew how to identify targeted plants and failed to pay attention during in-person training, which led to lower correct identifications.
