<p>Across all species, we find that all training types were fairly effective with even submissions from the text/image training group being correct 81% of the time (
 <xref rid="pone-0111433-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Our hypothesis generally held true across species that those with app-based video training would do better than text/image training and in-person training would do the best. Encouragingly though, for the feasibility of broadly providing training to many people, submissions from the video-trained cohort actually outperformed the in-person training cohort in 3 of the 5 plant species. These findings need to be considered carefully though as the interactive effect of previous plant ID experience and training type is not taken into account in these descriptive statistics.
