<p>The percent correct by species shows that in general our understanding of the species' difficulty were reasonably accurate (
 <xref rid="pone-0111433-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). An exception may be Glossy Buckthorn and Autumn Olive. Glossy Buckthorn was classified as difficult, and this seems correct for those who received text/image training, but for those who received video on the app or in-person training Autumn Olive actually had lower percent correct scores. This may be because Russian Olive is quite common and similar in appearance to Autumn Olive, which led to more false reports for this species.
