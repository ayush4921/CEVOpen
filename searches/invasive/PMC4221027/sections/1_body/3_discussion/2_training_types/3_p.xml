<p>One caveat for the text/image group is that we did not have a way to restrict their access to the app-embedded training videos. Instead we explicitly instructed them to only use text/images and trusted them to comply. We also did not have a way to prevent participants in any of the groups from using outside resources such as guidebooks or online materials. However, as the results largely confirmed our expectations on training type and plant ID ability, it would appear that participants followed our instructions and did not cheat.</p>
