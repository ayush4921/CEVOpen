 <p>We thank Mr. Ted Elliman from the New England Wildflower Society for his reviews and suggestions both on the Outsmart app invasive species descriptions and also in reviewing the video scripts. Of course, any errors in those are our mistakes, alone. We also are grateful to Megan Kierstead, Sean Libby, Bridget Macdonald, Colleen Puzas, and Julia Sullivan for various contributions to the Outsmart project and to the experiment specifically. We thank Paul Catanzaro for his support of the Outsmart project website used for some experimental communication. We would also like to thank the two anonymous reviewers who provided helpful feedback and sharpened the final form of this paper.</p>
