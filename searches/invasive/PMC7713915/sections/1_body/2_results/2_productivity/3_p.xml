<p>The competitive interactions influencing the productivity of the species (RII) were impacted by the type of competition (intra‐ or interspecific) and by species (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>3, 614</sub> = 22.8, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001), but the arrival time of the species did not have an impact on competition. Under interspecific competition, all three native grasses were more competitive than 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> (BT), but under intraspecific competition, 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> (BT) was more competitive than all three native grasses (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36908-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; Tukey's HSD,

 <italic>Bromus tectorum</italic> (BT) was more competitive when grown with conspecifics compared to growing with native grasses (Tukey HSD, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). 
 <italic>Festuca campestris</italic> (FC) and 
 <italic>P. secunda</italic> (PA) were more competitive when grown under interspecific competition, and 
 <italic>P. spicata</italic> (PS) demonstrated similar competitive intensity in both intra‐ and interspecific conditions (Tukey HSD, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).
