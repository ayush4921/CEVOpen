<p>We found that the planting order altered aboveground productivity (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>27,129.2</sub> = 13.7; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001). As predicted, the treatments where BT was the first species to arrive had the greatest productivity (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, Tukey's HSD; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36908-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Productivity was reduced slightly or was similar to treatments when BT was the first or second species to arrive and generally decreased when BT was the third or fourth species planted (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, Tukey's HSD). The treatments with the lowest aboveground productivity were 
 <italic>Festuca campestris</italic> (FC) grown with conspecifics (FC → FC → FC → FC), which was similar to 
 <italic>Poa secunda</italic> (PA → PA → PA → PA) grown with conspecifics and the treatment with the planting order of 
 <italic>Poa secunda</italic> (PA), FC, 
 <italic>Pseudoroegeneria spicata</italic> (PS), then BT (PA → FC → PS → BT; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, Tukey's HSD).
