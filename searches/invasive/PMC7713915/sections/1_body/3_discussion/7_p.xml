<p>Therefore, it will be particularly important in restoration studies and land management to either facilitate the establishment of native species first, restrict early establishment of 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic>, or both. Further, this demonstrates a need for further exploration of the role of priority effects in species invasion and community assembly, particularly under increased globalization and changes in climate, resulting from climate change (Hess et al.,

As previously mentioned, grasslands are being degraded rapidly, and to effectively reverse or slow this reduction, we must have a better understanding of how community's assembly. The order in which species arrive, priority effects, may be one reason for alternative stable states, such as those dominated by 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic>, that are resistant to restoration.
