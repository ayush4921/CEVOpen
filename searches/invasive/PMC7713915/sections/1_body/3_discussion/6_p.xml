<p>This experiment explored how the impacts of both priority effects and invasion of 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> in relation to native species establishment and success during early successional phases of plant communities. Thus, if a site is at risk or already invaded by 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic>, restoration methods should take this into account. Our study appears to support the idea that the phenology of 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> may be a contributing factor to its invasion throughout North America, as 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> tends to grow early in the season compared with native species. Shifting precipitation patterns resulting from global climate change will influence the success of 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> and other non‐native winter annuals (Prevéy &amp; Seastedt, 
 <xref rid="ece36908-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). As temperatures increase, precipitation in late winter and early spring will continue to shift from snow to rain (Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36908-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>) and increases in rain early in the growing season could benefit early‐growing winter annuals, such as 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic>, to the detriment of native species (Prevéy &amp; Seastedt, 
 <xref rid="ece36908-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Our study confirms that early arrival of 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> can have major implications for community dynamics and productivity. The risk of invasion by this species may increase under future climate scenarios, suggesting that future studies are need to understand the arrival order of species will be influences by altered abiotic conditions.
