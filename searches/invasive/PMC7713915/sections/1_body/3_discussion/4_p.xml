<p>Dominance was impacted by the order of species arrival in this study, and 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> dominance was positively correlated with productivity and early arrival within the community. Treatments where 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> was the founder species had the highest productivity and dominance, as the other species contributed little to no aboveground biomass. Dominance was reduced significantly when 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> arrived last, as plant composition became more even. In the case of severely disturbed sites, where succession and priority effects will impact plant assembly and succession, the presence of 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> early in community assembly will likely result in its dominance. These differences in plant composition can have large effects on ecosystem processes if traits of one or a few species dominate (Hooper &amp; Vitousek, 
 <xref rid="ece36908-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>). Monocultures of 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> can disrupt ecosystem function through losses to biodiversity and plant traits specific to this species (Dukes &amp; Mooney,

 <xref rid="ece36908-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>). Specifically, 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> has been found to alter nutrient cycling (Blank,
