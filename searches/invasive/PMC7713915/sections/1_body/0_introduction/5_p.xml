<p>As a result of the limited experimental studies exploring priority effects on community assembly and plant invasions and to obtain greater control over the experiment, we conducted a greenhouse study that explores how the arrival order of an invasive grass, 
 <italic>Bromus tectorum</italic> (cheatgrass), affects productivity and community composition when grown with native, perennial grasses from western North America. 
 <italic>Bromus tectorum</italic> is found throughout Canada and the United States and is considered of high concern, particularly in northwestern North America, as it can completely replace native vegetation (Clinton et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36908-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Mack, 
 <xref rid="ece36908-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">1981</xref>; Upadhyaya et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36908-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">1986</xref>). Additionally, 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> is an agricultural and rangeland pest (Morrow &amp; Stahlman, 
 <xref rid="ece36908-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">1983</xref>) and increases wildfire risks, as dry 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> is highly flammable (Clinton et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36908-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Mack, 
 <xref rid="ece36908-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">1981</xref>; Upadhyaya et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36908-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">1986</xref>). 
 <italic>Bromus tectorum's</italic> phenology is timed to precipitation events (Mack, 
 <xref rid="ece36908-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">1984</xref>; Perkins &amp; Hatfield, 
 <xref rid="ece36908-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), and while the species generally germinates in the fall or winter, its germination may be staggered from August to May and may occur in a series of pulses within a few days after a precipitation event (Carpenter &amp; Murray, 
 <xref rid="ece36908-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>; Kaczmarski, 
 <xref rid="ece36908-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>; Mack, 
 <xref rid="ece36908-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">1984</xref>). This ability to germinate early and at various times during the growing season as well as 
 <italic>B. tectorum's</italic> ability to reach maturity earlier than native species could allow its dominance within communities (Clinton et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36908-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Kaczmarski, 
 <xref rid="ece36908-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>; Monsen, 
 <xref rid="ece36908-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">1992</xref>; Zouhar, 
 <xref rid="ece36908-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). 
 <italic>Bromus tectorum</italic> can have a high competitive advantage over native species, which is likely a result of its growth early in the spring and rapid growth response to seasonal water availability (Perkins &amp; Hatfield, 
 <xref rid="ece36908-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), but it is unclear how these priority effects will affect community dynamics.
