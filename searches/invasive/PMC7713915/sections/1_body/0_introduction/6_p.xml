<p>Here, we explored how priority effects alter plant community composition by examining the effects that the timing of arrival of 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> had on productivity and dominance when planted with three North American native, perennial grasses. Our objectives were to assess the impact of the arrival order of 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> on aboveground productivity when grown with native grasses, to explore how priority effects impacted community structure, specifically, evenness, and dominance, when native grasses are grown with an exotic grass, 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic>, and to explore a possible relationship between productivity and dominance. We hypothesized that 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> would impose priority effects, as a result of 
 <italic>B. tectorum's</italic> ability to germinate and grow rapidly following a precipitation event (i.e., watering), specifically reduced growth in the other species and increased dominance of 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> when grown earlier than native grasses. Since the native grasses tend to have slower growth rates, we expected the likelihood that native grasses would impose priority effects would increase the later that B. tectorum arrives by limiting resources, such as light, space, water, and nutrients.
