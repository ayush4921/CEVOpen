<p>By the end of 6 weeks, the time of the fourth planting interval each pot contained four individuals of each species and only the order of arrival varied among the pots; intraspecific competition control pots had four individuals of the same species, and no competition control pots had only one individual. After 10 weeks, shoots from all individuals were separated from the roots and cleaned of sand. Shoots, hereby, aboveground biomass, were oven dried at 65°C for 48 hr and weighed to 5 decimal places to assess the effects of arrival order on productivity, evenness, and dominance. Richness (S) was considered the number of species in the pots after 10 weeks. To better understand the relative abundance of each species, evenness was calculated using Pielou's evenness (J), where J = H′/log(S) (Oksanen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36908-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). H′ is the Shannon–Weaver diversity index and was calculated using the equation, Σp
 <sub>i</sub>ln(p
 <sub>i</sub>), where p
 <sub>i</sub> is the proportion of species. We also calculated the relative intensity index (RII) for each species at each time interval to better understand how plant interactions influenced productivity (Armas et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36908-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). RII represents the competitive effect of intra‐ and interspecific interactions compared with when the species is grown alone and is calculated using the formula: RII = (B
 <sub>w</sub> – B
 <sub>0</sub>)/(B
 <sub>w</sub> + B
 <sub>0</sub>), where B
 <sub>w</sub> is the biomass of a species growing with either type of competition and B
 <sub>0</sub> is the biomass of a species that is grown without competition. A negative effect indicates the species had a competitive effect and a positive effect indicates the species had a facilitative effect on the other individuals or species (Armas et al.,
