<p>Seedlings of each species were introduced to a pot at an interval of one species per planting interval without repeating a species until four individuals were in the pot, resulting in 24 possible combinations of arrival orders. Four individuals of the same species were also planted at the same planting intervals to serve as a control, that is, intraspecific competition control. An additional control was also included where an individual plant of each species was planted alone at each of the four planting intervals, that is, no competition control. All treatments were replicated six times into blocks. Seedlings were checked 3 days after transplant, and mortalities were replaced with individuals, which had been planted individually in a separate pot at the time of each planting. Seedlings that died after 3 days were counted as mortalities.</p>
