<p>The experiment was completed at the Research Greenhouse at Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada. Greenhouse conditions were controlled electronically (Argus control system) to maintain daytime conditions at 22°C and 60% relative humidity and nighttime conditions at 15°C and 85% relative humidity. A 14:10 hr day:night cycle was established using supplemental lighting supplied by three 1,000 W halogen overhead lamps. Seeds of each species were geminated in Petri dishes on a damp layer of sand and were transplanted into pots at four planting intervals (every 2 weeks). Each species had a radicle length of at least 15 mm and a single leaf before seedlings were transferred into 4‐inch plastic pots lined with landscape fabric to prevent sand from leaking; each pot was filled with approximately 1 L of clean builder's sand (King Play Sand©). Pots were regularly bottom‐watered with rain water to maintain 5 mm of water at the base and received 100 ml of Rorison's solution every seven days (Hendry et al.,
