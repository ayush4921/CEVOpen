 <p>We found evidence for priority effects, as productivity was positively related to dominance of 
  <italic>Bromus tectorum</italic> and was greater the earlier 
  <italic>B. tectorum</italic> arrived. This suggests that priority effects could be important for plant communities as the early arrival of an invasive species drastically impacted the productivity and biodiversity of our system at the early establishment stages of plant community development.
