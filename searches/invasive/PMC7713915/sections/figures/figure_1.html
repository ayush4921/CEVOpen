 <caption> Aboveground productivity (total shoot biomass) of the 28 planting order treatments according to interspecific competition in order of productivity and the arrival time of Bromus tectorum and intraspecific competition. Each bar represents the mean of the total shoot biomass with standard error. Letters represent statistically similar groups (Tukey's HSD, alpha = 0.05). The four species planted, BT, Festuca campestris (FC), Pseudoroegeneria spicata (PS), and Poa secunda (PA), are color coded as gray, black, red, and blue, respectively. The proportion of each species contribution to aboveground productivity is stacked within each bar according to arrival order </caption>
