 <caption> Relative interaction index (RII) of species in relation to the level of competition (intra‐ and interspecific). The four species planted, Bromus tectorum (BT), Festuca campestris (FC), Pseudoroegeneria spicata (PS), and Poa secunda (PA), are color coded as gray, black, red, and blue, respectively. Boxes represent the interquartile ranges (25th percentile and 75th percentile) and the line within each box indicates the median. The whiskers represent the spread of the data that falls. Points represent outliers from this spread or values 1.5 times greater or less than the inner quartile range. Letters indicate the significant difference between species within the same type of competition (intra‐ or interspecific competition) </caption>
