 <caption> Linear relationships between the shoot biomass (g) and dominance (1‐D), where 0 indicates high dominance and low diversity and 1 indicated high diversity. Individual points represent each pot, which are color coded according to the first species planted or founder species (BT =  Bromus tectorum, FC =  Festuca campestris, PS =  Pseudoroegeneria spicata, and PA =  Poa secunda). The colors represent the first species planted, where BT = gray, FC = black, PA = blue, and PS = red. The shapes correspond to the order in which BT was planted: 1st = filled circle, 2nd = open circle, 3rd = filled triangle, and 4th = open triangle </caption>
