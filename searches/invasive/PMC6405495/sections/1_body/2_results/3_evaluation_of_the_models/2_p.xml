<p>Among the tested models, the RF performed the best, followed by the ensemble model, GBM and SVM (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34919-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The last two performed comparably. While the GBM achieved slightly higher accuracies and kappa statistics than the SVM, but the SVM obtained better sensitivity and specificity scores. While the GBM‐BRT achieved high accuracy compared to the GLM but its kappa, sensitivity, and specificity scores are low. However, the GLM's specificity score was higher than the ones obtained by the GBM‐BRT model. DNN did not perform well. Its sensitivity and specificity scores were very unbalanced and its sensitivity score was very low. All models performed better in terms of specificity than sensitivity. This indicates that uninvaded areas (true absence rate) were better identified and classified than invaded areas (true presence rate).
