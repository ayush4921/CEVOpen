<p>Variable reduction contributed to model stability, which is evident in the GBM‐BRT and GLM models. Similar studies in the GBM showed model stability after variable reduction (Getis &amp; Ord

Removal of the topographic variables such as Rugged, Landform, Relief, and Slope from most of the tested models indicates that these variables contributed little to the models’ performances. Also, except through Elevation, topography does not seem to add significant information regarding the current distribution and cover of

 <xref rid="ece34919-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). The ROC curve in the GLM nears quickly the 100% true positives rate but the ROC curve in the DNN remains flat achieving a comparably high amount of false‐positive rate compared to its true‐positive rate. Different reasons could have led to a poor performance, for example, batch size may be small to the DNN. But then there are things like to check for hidden dimension layers, analyze the gradient checks. Further tuning might have been necessary to improve the DNN (change a different optimizer, change regularization, check and adjust weights at initialization, etc). However, this requires further investigation.
