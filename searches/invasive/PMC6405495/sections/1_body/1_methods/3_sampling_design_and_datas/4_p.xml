<p>The remotely sensed datasets were checked for geometric correspondence to all other datasets. Further, these datasets were atmospherically corrected using the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) algorithm (Chavez,

 <xref rid="ece34919-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). The Red, the near‐infrared (NIR) and the first shortwave‐infrared (SWIR1) bands of Landsat 8 were selected as explanatory variables. Furthermore, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was calculated from Red and NIR bands and used as another input. All selected bands, as well as the NDVI, have proven to be particularly suitable to capture photosynthetic active vegetation, and soil and vegetation moisture content (Barsi, Lee, Kvaran, Markham, &amp; Pedelty, 
 <xref rid="ece34919-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Additionally, daytime (LSTd) and nighttime (LSTn) land surface temperatures from MODIS sensor were included. In order to have longer‐term LSTd and LSTn average data, a 5‐year average of these products was generated between 2012 and 2017. The spatial resolution of these datasets is 1 km. Although this seems rather low compared to the other datasets, these day‐ and nighttime temperature datasets have shown to be useful in species distribution modeling and, particularly in Africa where weather stations are scarce. These datasets have shown to be more accurate than other global climate datasets (Ashby, Moreno‐Madriñán, Yiannoutsos, &amp; Stanforth,
