<p>The DNN has become very popular recently but is still sparsely used by the geoscience community (Zhang, Zhang, &amp; Du, 
 <xref rid="ece34919-bib-0101" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). The DNN is fully connected neural networks composed of multiple hidden layers together with non‐linear transformations and a variety of tailored architectures (Guo et al.,
