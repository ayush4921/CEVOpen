<p>We provide new information on the plasticity of seeds of 
 <italic>I. capensis</italic>. There are only few papers on the phenotypic variability of species of 
 <italic>Impatiens</italic>. Data on the morphology of seeds can prove useful for determining the impact of various environmental factors on morphological traits and show whether a given feature is stable or susceptible to environmental change.
