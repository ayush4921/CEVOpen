<p>The majority of balsam species grow in hardly accessible mountain ranges and have delicate flowers with complex morphology (

 <xref rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr">Rahelivololona et al., 2018</xref>). Herbarium specimens of balsams are difficult to prepare due to the succulent nature of the stems. Specimens need special preparations such as floral dissections (
 <xref rid="ref-75" ref-type="bibr">Shui et al., 2011</xref>) and extensive field notes, otherwise they are of limited value. Flower colors fade quickly and the position of the individual flower parts is often impossible to determine from traditionally prepared specimens. One of the taxonomically important features within the genus 
 <italic>Impatiens</italic> is related to the morphology of seeds. First information on the diversity of the seed coat of 
 <italic>Impatiens</italic> was reported by 
 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">Hooker &amp; Thomson (1859)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ref-95" ref-type="bibr">Warburg &amp; Reiche (1895)</xref>. Other works were concerned mostly with the shape and size of seeds rather than details of their surface ornamentation (
