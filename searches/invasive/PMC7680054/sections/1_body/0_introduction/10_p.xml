<p>The aim of our work has been to characterize the micromorphological traits and ultrastructure of 
 <italic>I.Â capensis</italic> seeds from various habitats and growing conditions and their morphological variability. Anthropogenic changes in habitats were expected as important factors affecting seed micromorphology and ultrastructure.
