<p>Seed morphological features of 
 <italic>Impatiens</italic> have not only been used for solving various taxonomic problems within the genus but also prove to be useful for determining the impact of various environmental factors on the phenotypic variability of balsam species (

The understanding of environmentally induced variation in an individual plant phenotype is crucial for predicting population responses to environmental changes. This issue is particularly important regarding invasive species which occupy a wide range of habitats in the invaded range (
