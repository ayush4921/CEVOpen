<p>One of the species with morphologically undescribed seeds is

 <xref rid="ref-51" ref-type="bibr">Meusel et al., 1978</xref>), which is currently spreading across Europe. Today 
 <italic>I. capensis</italic> is considered as naturalized in several European countries (
 <xref rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr">Matthews et al., 2015</xref>), including Poland, where the species is locally established and invasive due to its rapid spread in the secondary range and high competitiveness in relation to native species, even perennials (
 <xref rid="ref-86" ref-type="bibr">Tokarska-Guzik et al., 2012</xref>). In Poland, it was found for the first time in 1987 (
 <xref rid="ref-60" ref-type="bibr">Pawlaczyk &amp; Adamowski, 1991</xref>), and it is currently spreading in the Western Pomerania region (
 <xref rid="ref-61" ref-type="bibr">Popiela et al., 2015</xref>; M Myśliwy, pers. obs., 2017). The species occurs in the area of the Szczecin Lagoon and enters alder forests, willow shrubs, rushes and riparian tall herb fringe communities (

 <xref rid="ref-57" ref-type="bibr">Myśliwy, Ciaciura &amp; Hryniewicz, 2009</xref>; M Myśliwy, pers. obs., 2014). It also appears in moist anthropogenic habitats, e.g., along roadside ditches (M Myśliwy, pers. obs., 2017).
