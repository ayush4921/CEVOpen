<p>We here provide new data about the seed morphology and seed coat sculpture of 
 <italic>I. capensis,</italic> as well as new information about the area of its distribution in Poland. Our studies have shown maximum seed length (5.74 mm) and width (3.21 mm) beyond the values reported elsewhere. 
 <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Bojňanský &amp; Fargašová (2007)</xref> found seeds of 
 <italic>I. capensis</italic> to be 5-5.6 mm long and 2.7–3.1 mm wide. Our ultrastructural studies have shown two types of cells on between the ribs and on the ribs, that have previously not been described (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Fig. 5</xref>). The occurrence of several types of epidermal cells on the seeds of members of 
 <italic>Impatiens</italic> was previously noted, for instance, three types of epidermal cells have been reported in 
 <italic>Impatiens aconitoides</italic> by 
 <xref rid="ref-75" ref-type="bibr">Shui et al. (2011)</xref>. We were not able to confirm in any of our studied populations the presence of roundish spots on the surface of seeds (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-6">Fig. 6</xref>) as reported by 
 <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Bojňanský &amp; Fargašová (2007)</xref>, which may be due to the different geographical origin of the examined seeds: our seeds of 
 <italic>I. capensis</italic> are from wild-growing populations from various habitats, while those studied by 
 <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Bojňanský &amp; Fargašová (2007)</xref> were obtained from cultivation and of unknown origin.
