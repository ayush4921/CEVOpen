<p>Another important factor shaping a diverse array of plant traits, including morphological features, is climate (

Although this investigated plant has only a few localities inhabiting only a relatively small area in Poland, rapid expansion across environmental gradients has been reported for several plants introduced to a new area and species can evolve quite quickly driven by environmental factors (
