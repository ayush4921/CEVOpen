<p>Orange balsam is known for colonizing a wide range of habitats (

 <xref rid="ref-93" ref-type="bibr">Waller, 1980</xref>). Moreover, 
 <xref rid="ref-77" ref-type="bibr">Simpson, Leck &amp; Parker (1985)</xref> have shown that 
 <italic>I. capensis</italic> vegetative and reproductive growth parameters reflect habitat differences. Light availability (
 <xref rid="ref-77" ref-type="bibr">Simpson, Leck &amp; Parker, 1985</xref>) as well as soil moisture and pH (
 <xref rid="ref-93" ref-type="bibr">Waller, 1980</xref>) have been reported to affect its growth patterns. Our studies indicate that five environmental variables were statistically significant and were able to serve to discern the studied populations in terms of seed size and weight: anthropogenic disturbances (which may serve as a proxy for habitat fertility), carbonates (CaCO
 <sub>3</sub>), loose sand presence, potassium (K), and soil moisture (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4</xref>). Populations G (Police) and E (Święta), occurring in the most disturbed anthropogenic habitats (artificial canal and roadside), have the heaviest seeds as a result of growth under favorable environmental conditions (neutral or slightly acidic soil with a relatively high C/N ratio). In turn, population B (Lubin) with the smallest and lightest seeds was associated with high soil pH, and the highest content of soil carbonates and calcium. Interestingly, 
 <xref rid="ref-94" ref-type="bibr">Waller (1982)</xref> reported that the higher nodes of 
 <italic>I. capensis</italic> individuals tended to produce heavier seeds. In 
 <xref rid="ref-94" ref-type="bibr">Waller’s (1982)</xref> opinion, the position effect probably leads to a greater mean seed size for higher plants. 
 <xref rid="ref-96" ref-type="bibr">Werner &amp; Platt (1976)</xref> stated that populations growing at higher plant densities often produce larger seeds. Our results are consistent with both studies, as the largest and heaviest seeds were obtained from populations G (Police) and E (Święta), formed by the highest plants, growing in large numbers and densities.
