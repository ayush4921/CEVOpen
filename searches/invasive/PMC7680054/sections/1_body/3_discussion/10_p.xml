<p>An evolutionary explanation for plant invasiveness implies that seed and fruit traits are crucial for invasive plants since they are related to dispersal strategies and mechanisms to cope with environmental stress. Some research reports have indicated that native and invasive populations employ different strategies for growth and reproduction (

 <xref rid="ref-54" ref-type="bibr">Molina-Montenegro et al. (2018)</xref> suggest that some seed traits of invasive plant species with rapid adaptive capacity can evolve leading to maximizing their establishment in new environments and such features can be heritable.
