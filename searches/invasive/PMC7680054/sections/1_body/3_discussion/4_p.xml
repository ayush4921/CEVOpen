<p>The analysis of SEM micrographs of 
 <italic>I. noli-tangere</italic> seeds closely related to 
 <italic>I. capensis</italic> (
 <xref rid="ref-101" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2015</xref>) has shown that seed coats of this species vary significantly depending on the geographical origin of the seeds (
 <xref rid="ref-90" ref-type="bibr">Utami &amp; Shimizu, 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2007a</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2008</xref>). On the other hand, the comparison of the seed micromorphology of 
 <italic>I. capensis</italic> has not shown similarity to seed coat ornamentation of the aforementioned 
 <italic>I. noli-tangere</italic> (with narrow and ellipsoid seeds, fine reticulate subtype, testa cells with reticulate thickened outer walls; 
 <xref rid="ref-79" ref-type="bibr">Song, Yuan &amp; Kupfer, 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-90" ref-type="bibr">Utami &amp; Shimizu, 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2008</xref>). Despite the fact that both species are closely related and may be confused (
 <xref rid="ref-107" ref-type="bibr">Zika, 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-101" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2015</xref>), their seeds clearly differ morphologically. The new data presented here may be useful in the identification of these species. In turn, there is no information about the seed morphology of 
 <italic>I. pallida</italic>, which is sympatric and synchronic species to 
 <italic>I. capensis</italic> (
 <xref rid="ref-69" ref-type="bibr">Rust, 1977</xref>), which makes this subject even more difficult. Elucidating the overall variation in seed coat micromorphology and to implement this feature to taxonomy of 
 <italic>I. capensis</italic> will require more samplings, also within the native range of orange jewelweed as well as other closely related species and this eventually should become the basis for further comparisons and studies. Seed ultrastructure appears to be a constant feature within a taxonomic unit (
 <xref rid="ref-81" ref-type="bibr">Stace, 1992</xref>) and, as morphological studies show, seed shape and size are highly diverse at the genus and species levels (
 <xref rid="ref-100" ref-type="bibr">Yu, Chen &amp; Qin, 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-75" ref-type="bibr">Shui et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-88" ref-type="bibr">Ullah et al., 2019a</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-89" ref-type="bibr">Ullah et al., 2019b</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">Hadidchi, Attar &amp; Ullah, 2020</xref>). Both statements have been proven for 
 <italic>I. capensis</italic> in Poland.
