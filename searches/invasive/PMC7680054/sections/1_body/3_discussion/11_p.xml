<p>Due to the scarcity of data we could not point out the presence of morphological differentiation between native and invasive populations of 
 <italic>I. capensis</italic>, and we have not been able to determine whether the seed traits are evolving. However, 
 <italic>I. capensis</italic>, classified as an invasive species in Poland, can be suspected, while adapting and occupying new territories and competing with native species, to develop specific adaptations, contributing to its success and spread in the new environments.
