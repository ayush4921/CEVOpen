<p>Environmental heterogeneity is indicated as a major factor driving morphological changes (
 <xref rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr">Nakazato, Bogonovich &amp; Moyle, 2008</xref>). Seeds are sensitive to changes in biotic and abiotic conditions (
 <xref rid="ref-52" ref-type="bibr">Moles et al., 2005</xref>). According to 
 <xref rid="ref-76" ref-type="bibr">Silvertown (1989)</xref>, the correlation between seed size and the place where plant is growing is an adaptative feature. Bigger seeds occur in habitats with stable environmental conditions, where seedlings may grow slowly. Small seeds are generally produced by plants with a short life cycle, growing mainly in disturbed habitats.
