<p>The studied seeds of 
 <italic>I. capensis</italic> were round in shape, with a lusterless, rough, and dark-brown surface, without roundish and paler spots (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Fig. 5</xref>). The seeds had four strong, clear ribs, the apex and bottom narrowed. Each rib was built of rows of 4–5 cells and had a darker color than the surface between them (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Fig. 5H</xref>). The seed coat is composed of two types of epidermal cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Figs. 5E</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">5H</xref>) creating a net-like pattern. The cells of the seed surface between the ribs were: elongated with straight anticlinal walls (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Fig. 5E</xref>), raised cell boundaries between the cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Fig. 5G</xref>), slightly concave outer periclinal walls (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Figs. 5F</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">5G</xref>) and a micropapillate secondary sculpture on the edges of anticyclic walls (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Fig. 5F</xref>). Near the ribs, there were rows of 4–7 isodiametric cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Figs. 5I</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">5K</xref>) with straight anticlinal walls (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Figs. 5L</xref>), with raised cell boundaries (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Fig. 5M</xref>) and concave outer periclinal walls. Seeds from all studied populations did not differ in their ultrastructure (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">5D</xref>).
