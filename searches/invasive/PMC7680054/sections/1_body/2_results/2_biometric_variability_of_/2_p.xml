<p>The location of population H (Trzebieradz) in the ordination space (the upper part of the RDA diagram) was associated with the highest C/N ratio, the highest soil moisture and shading, as well as with the lowest soil pH and the lowest soil content of CaCO
 <sub>3</sub>, Ca, P, and K (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="table-6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). At the same time, the H population was dominated by short specimens (
 <xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), with one of the lightest seeds and average values of biometric traits (
 <xref rid="table-2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In contrast, populations characterized by the longest, widest, and heaviest seeds, from E (Święta) and G (Police), located in the right-hand side of the RDA diagram, were also related to a relatively high C/N ratio, but unlike the previous population, they were associated with a low level of soil moisture as well as the highest anthropogenic disturbances (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4</xref>), and consisted of the tallest specimens (
 <xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Population D (Czarnocin) occupied the bottom part of the diagram and was distinct in its organic soil, with the highest content of organic matter (LOI), as well as P, K, Mg, and Na content in the soil, while having the lowest C/N ratio (
 <xref rid="table-6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). The lowest values of the seed biometric traits were found for population B (Lubin), located in the left-hand part of the RDA diagram (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="table-2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), and associated with high soil pH and the highest content of soil carbonates and calcium, as well as a low level of soil moisture (
 <xref rid="table-6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). The other populations (A: Podgrodzie; C: Unin; F: Szczecin-Zdroje) were also on the left side of the diagram, but closer to the center (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4</xref>). Neither their seed biometric traits nor habitat conditions were distinct (
