<p>All environmental variables included in the RDA accounted for 35.6% of the total variation. The results of stepwise forward selection of variables indicated that five variables: anthropogenic disturbances (Anthrop), carbonates (CaCO
 <sub>3</sub>), loose sand presence (LoSa), potassium (K), and soil moisture content (Moist) were statistically significant and varied between the studied populations of 
 <italic>I. capensis</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4</xref>). Along the gradient represented by Axis I, the highest correlation between the sample position and environmental variables (the so-called interset correlation) was typical of anthropogenic disturbances and CaCO
 <sub>3</sub>, followed by the degree of shading and soil Ca, while the C/N ratio was most closely correlated with Axis II, followed by soil content of P, Na, K, and organic soil.
