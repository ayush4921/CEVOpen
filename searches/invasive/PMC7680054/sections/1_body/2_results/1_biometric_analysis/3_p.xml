 <xref rid="table-3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The most variable features were the seed area (CV = 21.76%) and width (CV = 15.35%). The variation of seed traits ranged insignificantly from 6.19% (H population) to 10.28% (B) for SL; from 7.30% (D) to 20.57% (B) for SW; from 6.22% (H) to 11.42% (B) for SC; and from 13.88% (D) to 26.06% (B) for SA, respectively.
