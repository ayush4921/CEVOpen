<p>The similarity analysis using Euclidean’s distances showed two main clusters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3</xref>). The first cluster included six populations of 
 <italic>I. capensis</italic> (A–D, F, H), all derived from natural habitats, while the other cluster groups two populations (E, G) from anthropogenic habitats, where the examined plants were the highest (
 <xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). According to the dendrogram (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3</xref>), populations C and F are the closest to each other; both were associated with river valleys (Dziwna and Oder rivers, respectively) and close to the river bed, hence under the influence of flooding. The D and A populations were growing in tall herb communities on the banks of the Szczecin Lagoon. The most distinct populations in the first cluster (H and B) were also found on the banks of the Szczecin Lagoon, but they had the lowest average height and differed in habitat conditions from the other populations of this cluster (
