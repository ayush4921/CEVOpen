<p>In order to characterize habitat conditions at each locality, five soil core samples (0–20 cm depth) were collected and then mixed together into one composite sample. Soil samples were dried at room temperature, and passed through a sieve to remove fractions larger than one mm. The following physicochemical soil parameters were determined (

 <xref rid="ref-56" ref-type="bibr">Myśliwy (2019)</xref>: organic matter content defined as the loss on ignition (LOI)–soil samples annealed at 550 °C (%); grain composition (the content of sand, silt, clay)–Bouyoucos’s sedimentation method, modified by Casagrande and Prószyński; granulometric categories according to the 
 <xref rid="ref-62" ref-type="bibr">Polish Society of Soil Science (2009)</xref> classification; soil reaction (pH)–the potentiometric method, in 1-M solution of KCl; soil calcium carbonate (CaCO

 <sub>org</sub>) content (%), and total nitrogen (N
 <sub>tot</sub>) content (%) were determined by an elemental analyzer CHNS/O FlashSmart (Thermo Scientific), and the C/N ratio; the content of available forms of soil nutrients (mg/100 g soil): calcium (Ca) and sodium (Na) were determined spectrophotometrically (Ca–AAS and Na–EAS) on ICE3000; potassium (K) and phosphorus (P)–measured according to the Egner-Riehm method; magnesium (Mg)–measured by Schachtschabel’s method; soil moisture content, hand-felt assessed directly in the field using a 4-point scale recommended by the
