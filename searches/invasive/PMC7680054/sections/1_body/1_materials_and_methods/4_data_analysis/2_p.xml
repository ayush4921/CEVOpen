<p>The cluster analysis based on the nearest neighbor method was performed using the matrix on the population’s mean values. As the dataset required a linear response model (
 <xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">Jongman et al., 1995</xref>), the Redundancy Analysis (RDA) was used to relate the variability of morphological traits of seeds to environmental variables. The variables C
 <sub>org</sub> and N
 <sub>tot</sub> were excluded from the RDA as they were strongly correlated with organic matter content (LOI). The Monte Carlo permutation test with the forward selection of environmental variables was applied to determine the importance and statistical significance of variables in explaining the variability in seeds. The software packages Canoco v.4.5 (
