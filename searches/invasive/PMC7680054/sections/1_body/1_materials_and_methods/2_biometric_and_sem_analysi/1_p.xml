<p>From 24 to 30 mature seeds were used from each population for biometric analysis. We measured four quantified seed traits: seed length (SL), seed width (SW), seed circumference (SC), and seed area (SA). The seeds were measured as previously described in 
 <xref rid="ref-64" ref-type="bibr">Rewicz et al. (2017)</xref>. In order to describe the seed mass, we used 15 seeds from each population. The seeds were weighed with an Ohaus PA 21. We determined
