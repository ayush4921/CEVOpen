<p>We used eight seeds from each population for SEM. The seeds were air-dried and sputter-coated with a 4-nm-thick layer of gold (Leica EM ACE200). The SEM work was performed on a Phenom Pro X Scanning Electron Microscope at the Department of Invertebrate Zoology and Hydrobiology, University of Lodz, Poland. The 3D models of the seed surface were generated using the dedicated software 
 <italic>3D Roughness Reconstruction</italic> for Phenom. SEM micrographs were analyzed as previously described in
