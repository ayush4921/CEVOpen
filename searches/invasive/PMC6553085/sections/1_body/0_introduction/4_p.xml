<p>Many alien invasive plants have the capacity for clonal growth (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2006</xref>). However, the understanding of the responses of invasive clonal plants to soil nutrient heterogeneity remains limited. Thus, to investigate how soil nutrient heterogeneity affects the growth performance and intraspecific competition of invasive clonal plants, we conducted an experiment with the stoloniferous, invasive clonal plant 
 <italic>Myriophyllum aquaticum</italic>. We hypothesized that soil nutrient heterogeneity will significantly increase the growth performance and influence the intraspecific competition intensity of 
 <italic>M. aquaticum</italic>.
