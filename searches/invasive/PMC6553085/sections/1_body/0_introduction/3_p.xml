<p>Soil nutrient heterogeneity can affect the competitive relationship between plants (

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Mommer et al., 2012</xref>). The relationship between the degree of nutrient heterogeneity and the intensity of competition changes dynamically (

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Van et al., 2011</xref>). For example, soil nutrient heterogeneity can increase the intensity of competition (

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Day et al., 2003b</xref>) because the nutrient-absorbing organs of neighboring plants would be concentrated in a smaller area of high quality in heterogeneous environments. However, 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al. (2012)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al. (2018)</xref> found that soil nutrient heterogeneity does not increase competition when plants are genetically identical. Another theory is that a significant effect of soil heterogeneity on intraspecific or interspecific competition may be caused by the differences between plants in their ability to concentrate their nutrient-absorbing organs where resource levels are high (
