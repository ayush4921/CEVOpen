<p>In this experiment, six experimental treatment groups were analyzed, with six samples in each treatment group. The total biomass, aboveground biomass and belowground biomass were transformed using the log
 <sub>10</sub>(x) function. Thus, all experimental data met the assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance prior to analysis. Two-way ANOVAs were used to test the effects of plant density and soil treatments on the growth traits and intensity of intraspecific competition of 
 <italic>M. aquaticum</italic>. Duncanâ€™s test was used to examine the differences in trait values among the treatments. All data analyses were conducted using SPSS 22.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, United States).
