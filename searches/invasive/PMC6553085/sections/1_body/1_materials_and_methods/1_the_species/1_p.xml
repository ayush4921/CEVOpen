 <italic>Myriophyllum aquaticum</italic> (Vell.) Verdc., a perennial aquatic clonal plant is widely distributed in tropical and temperate regions such as South America (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Sutton, 1985</xref>). This species can grow in a broad range of habitats, from semi-moist to semi-submersed conditions (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Hussner et al., 2010</xref>) and forms dense floating mats by producing creeping stolons over the water surface (

 <italic>M. aquaticum</italic> produces flowers and fruits from April to September (

 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Wersal and Madsen, 2011</xref>). The 
 <italic>M. aquaticum</italic> plants used in this experiment were collected from natural plant populations at the National Field Station of Freshwater Ecosystem of Liangzi Lake (N 30°05′–30°18′, E 114°21′–114°39′) in Hubei Province, China. All of the collected plant materials were planted in containers (100 cm long × 50 cm wide × 50 cm deep). The containers were filled with clay (TN: 2.77 ± 0.54 mg.g
 <sup>-1</sup>, TP: 0.79 ± 0.19 mg.g
 <sup>-1</sup>) and to maintain a moist habitat, 1-cm-deep lake water (TN: 0.6 ± 0.2 mg. L
 <sup>-1</sup>; TP: 0.04 ± 0.01 mg. L
 <sup>-1</sup>) was maintained above the substrate surface throughout the pre-cultivated period. The plant materials were pre-cultivated in the greenhouse for approximately 2 months before the experiment was set up. On June 20, 2017, we selected 220 morphologically identical plants without shoots. Sixteen plants were randomly selected and dried to determine their initial biomass. The 204 remaining plants (height: approximately 25 cm; initial biomass: mean ± SE, 5.66 ± 0.58 g) were selected for the experiment.
