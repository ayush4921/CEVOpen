<p>During the experiment, the experimental units were randomly repositioned every week to avoid the potential effects of environmental heterogeneity (such as light) and 1-cm-deep lake water (TN: 0.6 ± 0.2 mg. L
 <sup>-1</sup>; TP: 0.04 ± 0.01 mg. L
 <sup>-1</sup>) was maintained above the substrate surface. The diurnal variation in temperature, humidity and illumination was recorded each day by a hygrothermograph and an illuminometer in the greenhouse. The mean values of temperature, humidity, and illumination in the greenhouse were 27.58 ± 0.62°C, 64.52 ± 1.22% and 2892.06 ± 321.93 μmol. m
