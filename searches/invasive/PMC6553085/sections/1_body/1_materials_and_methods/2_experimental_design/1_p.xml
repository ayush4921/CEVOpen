<p>The experiments used a two-factorial design of plant density treatments and soil treatments. Plants were subjected to three density treatments (one, four, or twelve plants per container) and two soil treatments (homogeneous or heterogeneous; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Each experimental container was 60 cm in height × 60 cm in diameter. There were six container replicates for each of the six treatments and thus 36 containers in total. The heterogeneous soil treatment was composed of two contrasting patches of equal volumes of clay (total nitrogen content: 2.98 ± 0.64 mg.g
 <sup>-1</sup>, total phosphorus content: 0.83 ± 0.21 mg.g
 <sup>-1</sup>, organic material content: 45.11 ± 2.67 mg.g
 <sup>-1</sup>, mean ± SE) and pure sand. For the homogeneous soil treatment, each container was a mixture of the same total amounts of clay and sand as in the heterogeneous treatments. The total amount of soil nutrients was the same in all treatments.
