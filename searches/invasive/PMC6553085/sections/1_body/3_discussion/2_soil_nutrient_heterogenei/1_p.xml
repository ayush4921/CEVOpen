<p>Spatial heterogeneity in soil nutrient availability can influence interspecific or intraspecific competition (

This may lead to fierce competition between plant species in heterogeneous conditions because the foraging organs of neighboring plants would be concentrated in a smaller patch of the soil. A previous study showed that soil nutrient heterogeneity, acting through its effect on competition, is likely to be an important influence on community structure and composition (
