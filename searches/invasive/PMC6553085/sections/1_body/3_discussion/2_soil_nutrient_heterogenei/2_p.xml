<p>However, in this study, we found that soil nutrient heterogeneity could not alter the intraspecific competition of 
 <italic>M. aquaticum</italic>. This was not due to an absence of competition, as plants grew less at high than at low density treatments both when soil nutrients were homogeneous and when they were heterogeneous. The reasons for these results may be as follows: First, clonal plants can share resources among individual subunits by physiological integration (
