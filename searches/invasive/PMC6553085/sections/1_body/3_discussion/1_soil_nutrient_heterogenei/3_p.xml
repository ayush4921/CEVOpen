<p>Except for a higher number of shoots, slight effects and even lower biomass of 
 <italic>M. aquaticum</italic> were found in heterogeneous nutrient treatments. This result is not completely in agreement with the prediction of our hypothesis but is consistent with previous studies, for example, nutrient heterogeneity does not affect the growth of a species of the same genera, 
 <italic>Myriophyllum spicatum</italic> (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2016</xref>). 
 <italic>Vallisneria natans</italic> and 
 <italic>Prosopis glandulosa</italic> did not show any significant changes in growth performance under spatially heterogeneous conditions (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Maestre and Reynolds, 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2007</xref>). On the other hand, 
 <italic>M. aquaticum</italic> survival and spread depends solely on vegetative reproduction via fragmentation (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Sutton, 1985</xref>). The higher number of shoots may aid in the spread of this species. Thus, soil nutrient heterogeneity can have a positive effect on invasive success in 
 <italic>M. aquaticum</italic>, especially through occupying space and spreading.
