<p>However, our study found that 
 <italic>M. aquaticum</italic> produced significantly more and longer shoots in the heterogeneous soil than in the homogenous soil treatment. Morphological plasticity enables the adaptation of clonal plants to heterogeneous environments, which probably benefits clonal plants through the optimization of plant performance (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Kroon and Hutchings, 1995</xref>). Clonal integration may help 
 <italic>M. aquaticum</italic> adapt to the heterogeneous distribution of resources. For example, clonal integration can boost the growth of 
 <italic>M. aquaticum</italic> when subjected to heterogeneity in resource supply in changing environments (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">You et al., 2013</xref>). Clonal plants can share photosynthates, mineral nutrients, or water among individual subunits through clonal integration, which increases the survival of clonal plants when they experience heterogeneous distribution of resources (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, we predict that the positive response of clonal plants to environmental heterogeneity may be correlated with clonal integration and morphological plasticity.
