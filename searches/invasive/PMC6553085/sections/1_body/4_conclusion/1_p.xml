<p>We conclude that spatial heterogeneity in soil nutrient availability is likely to be a primary promoter of invasive success in 
 <italic>M. aquaticum</italic>. In the case of 
 <italic>M. aquaticum</italic>, the positive effects of soil nutrient heterogeneity are shown mainly in the morphological characteristics of individual clonal shoots and cannot change the competitive relationship of clonal plants such as 
 <italic>M. aquaticum</italic>. Therefore, spatial heterogeneity in soil nutrient availability may have a positive effect on the invasive spread of 
 <italic>M. aquaticum</italic>. In the future, a more intimate knowledge of how diversified environmental heterogeneity due to various ecological factors at different scales affects the invasive performance of alien species is needed. This will enable a better understanding of the dynamic changes in invasive species composition and richness in aquatic ecosystems.
