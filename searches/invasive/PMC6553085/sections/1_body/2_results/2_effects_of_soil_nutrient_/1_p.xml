<p>With the increase in plant density, the intraspecific competition intensity increased gradually. For example, the log response ratio of biomass (LnRR) significantly increased, by approximately 51.73% âˆ¼ 87.38%, both when soil nutrients were homogeneous and when they were heterogeneous (

 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These results show that the intraspecific competition of 
 <italic>M. aquaticum</italic> gradually intensified with increasing plant density. Although the intraspecific competition intensity of the high-density treatment was very high, soil nutrient heterogeneity did not aggravate intraspecific competition in 
 <italic>M. aquaticum</italic> (
