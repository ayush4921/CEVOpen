<p>The soil substrate type had a significant effect on the total biomass, aboveground biomass and number of shoots (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, it had no significant effects on belowground biomass, shoot length or plant height (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C,E,F</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For example, in the twelve-plant density treatment, soil nutrient heterogeneity significantly reduced total biomass by 38.94% and aboveground biomass by 35.46% but significantly increased the 1.46-fold number of shoots compared to plants grown in homogeneous soil (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A,B,D</xref>). Density treatments had a significant influence on the growth performance of 
 <italic>M. aquaticum</italic>, and the growth traits of the low-density treatment were significantly greater than those of the high-density treatment (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">F</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For example, soil nutrient heterogeneity significantly increased shoot number by 70.37% in single-plant treatments and shoot length by 87.17% in four-plant treatments compared to plants grown in homogeneous soil.
