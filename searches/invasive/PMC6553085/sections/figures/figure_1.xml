  <p>Schematic representation of the experimental design. Soil heterogeneity treatment design: light gray and lightly stippled areas represent high (clay) and low (sand) soil nutrient patches, respectively. Soil homogeneity treatment design: the area in dark gray was filled with an even mixture of the same volume of clay and sand. The total amounts of soil nutrients were thus the same in both treatments. Black dots represent where 
   <italic>M. aquaticum</italic> was planted in three density-level treatments: one, four, or twelve plants per pot.
