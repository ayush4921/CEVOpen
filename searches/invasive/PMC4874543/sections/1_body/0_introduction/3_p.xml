 <italic>Centaurea stoebe</italic> (syn.

 <italic>maculosa</italic> Lam., Asteraceae), is a widespread, short-lived forb native to Europe that was introduced into North America as a seed contaminant some 150 years ago [
 <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In Europe (EU), it exists as two cytotypes, diploids (2n = 2x = 18) and allo-tetraploids (2n = 4x = 36), which occurs in predominantly single-cytotype populations [

 <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, so far, only tetraploids have been recorded from its introduced North American (NA) range, despite the higher frequency of diploid populations at home, a largely sympatric and similar geographic distribution of diploid and tetraploid populations in Europe [
