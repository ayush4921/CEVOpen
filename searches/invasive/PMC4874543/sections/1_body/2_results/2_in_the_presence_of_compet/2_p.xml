<p>Overall, the biomass of the three geo-cytotypes of

 <italic>stoebe</italic> did not differ, nor did they differ when competing with EU or NA neighbouring community biomass (F
 <sub>2, 48</sub> = 1.91, P = 0.16 and F
 <sub>1, 48</sub> = 1.07, P = 0.31 for geo-cytotypes and NC origins, respectively;

 <italic>stoebe</italic> differed both among geo-cytotypes as well as between neighbouring community origins (Resid. Deviance = 10.2, F = 3.53, P = 0.04 and Resid. Deviance = 7.51, F = 8.88, P = 0.005 for geo-cytotypes and NC origins, respectively;

 <italic>stoebe</italic> flowered when competing with neighbouring community than the two EU cytotypes (Tukey Contrasts, P = 0.03 &amp; P = 0.04, for EU2x and EU4x respectively), while EU2x and EU4x 
 <italic>C</italic>.

 <italic>C</italic>.
