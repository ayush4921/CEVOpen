<p>Restoration to the original state is only possible if land use practice did not result in the crossing of an abiotic threshold with altered abiotic conditions in a way that they no longer support historic native plant communities or in the crossing of a biotic threshold, that is native species have gone extinct

 </sup>. In this case directional change towards novel plant communities should be considered that provide important ecosystem services and maintain conditions favourable to native communities
