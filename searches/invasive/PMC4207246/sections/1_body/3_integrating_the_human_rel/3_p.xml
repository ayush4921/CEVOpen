<p>If human release is identified as one of the most influential mechanism for invasive species abundance, this information could be transferred to management as leverage to prevent, eradicate, contain or mitigate biological invasions

If the Human Release Hypothesis gains support, this would suggest that sporadic disturbances through road construction of forest clearing may call for on-going human management in order to prevent invasive populations becoming so abundant that eradication efforts are futile.
