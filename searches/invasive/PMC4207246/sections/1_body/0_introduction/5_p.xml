<p>We first discuss how the Human Release Hypothesis fits into the context of other key hypotheses in invasion ecology. We then illustrate the hypothesis via a case study on a global invader, the sweetbriar rose ( 
 <italic>Rosa rubiginosa</italic> L.). Finally, we assess how the Human Release Hypothesis may be integrated into biological invasion research, and we hypothesize which locations worldwide may be particularly prone to supporting high abundances of invasive species.
