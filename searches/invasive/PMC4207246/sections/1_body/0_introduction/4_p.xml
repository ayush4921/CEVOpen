<p>Unlike the Disturbance Hypothesis and the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis, which explain patterns of establishment of invasive species

 </sup>, the Human Release Hypothesis specifically addresses the effect of land use on the abundance of alien species that are already established in particular areas outside their native ranges. Furthermore, in areas where Human Release takes place, single disturbance events may occur, but alien species can grow large populations because of a lack of active and continuous landscape maintenance. Finally, we propose that the Human Release Hypothesis can also explain why some species that are highly abundant in their invasive range have relatively low abundance in their native range. Such differences in abundance between native and invasive ranges could at least partly be explained by different patterns in land use in the two sets of ranges.
