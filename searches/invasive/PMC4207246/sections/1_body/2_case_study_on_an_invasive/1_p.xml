<p>To illustrate the plausibility of the Human Release Hypothesis, we present findings at two scales on the invasion success of 
 <italic>Rosa rubiginosa</italic>, a shrub native to Eurasia and invasive in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, North and South America (see 
 <xref ref-type="other" rid="B1">Dataset 1</xref> and Supplementary Figure S1). We show that existing hypotheses could not fully explain the invasion patterns observed for this species, and we argue that the Human Release Hypothesis could help to fill this explanation gap. First, we synthesize previous cross-continental case studies that compared plant performance between invasive populations in Central and Southern Argentina with native populations in Spain and Germany (for more details see Zimmermann 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012)

 </sup>. Second, we compare climatic conditions as well as land use and human population density between invasive and native 
 <italic>R. rubiginosa</italic> populations at a global scale. In combination, our findings suggest the Human Release Hypothesis may be a useful complementary hypothesis to other existing hypotheses in invasion biology ( 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).
