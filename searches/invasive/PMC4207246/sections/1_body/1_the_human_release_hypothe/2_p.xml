 </sup> summarized 29 leading hypotheses predicting invasion success and integrated them into the PAB-framework ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). This framework considers the size and frequency of introductions (i.e. propagule pressure, P), ecosystem invasibility based on abiotic characteristics of the new environment (A), and biotic characteristics of an invasive species and its recipient community (B). By testing the validity and importance of each factor, the main driver of a successful invasion can be identified. The Human Release Hypothesis applies after a successful invasion has already been accomplished, because it focuses on the abundance of successful invaders.
