  <title>Incorporating our hypothesis into the PAB framework.</title>
  <p>The establishment and abundance of invasive plant species are explained by different mechanisms, which have been summarized by Catford

   </sup> in the PAB framework (see text for details). However, the biological characteristics of a given invading species and of its new environment only partly explain the abundance of established invasive populations. We argue that additional insights can be gained via the Human Release Hypotheses, which can complement the existing PAB framework.
