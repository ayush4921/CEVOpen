   <italic>Rosa rubiginosa</italic> benefits from human release.
  </title>
  <p>( 
   <bold>a</bold>) Genetic diversity in 
   <italic>Rosa rubiginosa</italic> is higher in its native Spanish and German populations than in the introduced populations in Argentina, suggesting the species did not benefit from multiple introductions (for details see Zimmermann 
   <italic>et al.</italic> 2010) 
   <sup>
    <xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
   </sup>. ( 
   <bold>b</bold>) The species does not benefit from a climatic pre-adaptation to the new range. The world map shows the species' climatic niche based on the species’ native distribution (blue) and the invasive distribution (pink). Overlap of climatic niches (purple) is minimal. ( 
   <bold>c</bold>) 
   <italic>Rosa rubiginosa</italic> appears to benefit from “human release” in its new range. The barplot shows the global proportions of different anthropogenic biomes 
   <sup>
    <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
   </sup> according to the location of invasive and native sweetbriar rose populations. The native range has a larger proportion of residential areas and a higher human population density (log people/km 
   <sup>2</sup>). Only 0.56% of the invasive range is wildlands, and only 0.03% of the native range.
