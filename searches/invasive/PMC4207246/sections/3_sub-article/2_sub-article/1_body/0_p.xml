<p>Thank you for your thorough and helpful review. We have incorporated all the minor comments concerning typos and wording. For our response to the mayor comments please see below:

   <p>We included a more detailed explanation of landscape maintenance. The key difference between "disturbance" and "maintenance" is the time scale. Disturbance can be a single event but maintenance is defined as "work that is done to KEEP something in good conditions".</p>
   <p>See 
    <underline>Introduction</underline>: "We define intermediate levels of human activity as activity patterns defined by sporadic disturbance events that are followed by long periods lacking active management, such as fallowing or abandonment. In contrast, regions with high levels of human activity frequently experience active management, such as weeding, hedge trimming or mowing of field margins." 
   </p>
   <p>See section 
    <underline>The Human Release Hypothesis in the context of other invasion hypotheses</underline>: "Thus, we hypothesize that the abundance of invasive species should be highest in between these two extremes – namely in extensively used landscapes characterized by frequent fallowing, low levels of weed control, high heterogeneity, and many disturbed edges of small farmland patches 
    <sup>32</sup>. Such landscapes are where “human release” should contribute to optimal conditions for invasive species to establish large populations."

   <p>Yes, it does explain the abundance in both ranges. We clarified this now further in the 
    <underline>Introduction</underline>: "Finally, we propose that the Human Release Hypothesis can also explain why some species that are highly abundant in their invasive range have relatively low abundance in their native range."

   <p>We re-wrote this paragraph and hope it is now comprehensible:</p>
   <p>"To date, extensive data on the abundance of invasive alien species is widely lacking. Existing approaches to predict invasion patterns in response to anthropogenic global change have focused primarily on the development of novel ecosystems 
    <sup>11</sup> and alien species richness 
    <sup>12</sup>. Based on this, it is now widely acknowledged that systems containing high numbers of alien species tend to be those created and sustained by humans."

   <p>Future context. We now included a paragraph on how our hypothesis applies to different life strategies, and we encourage to investigate how comparisons between species from Asia and their invasive range could fit to our hypothesis. </p>
   <p>See section 
    <underline>The Human Release Hypothesis in the context of other invasion hypotheses</underline>: "Disturbance events also provide windows of opportunity for invasive species 
    <sup>26</sup> and are often the result of human activity. Many invasive plant species are adapted to exploit temporarily favourable conditions through their short life cycles, rapid growth, high reproductive allocation, persistent soil seed banks and rapid germination (the Ideal Weed Hypothesis) 
    <sup>27</sup>. All these traits are also of advantage in systems where frequent weeding or mowing is practiced. Therefore, species pursuing this competitive ruderal strategy could profit twofold from Human Release."
   </p>
   <p>See last section: "We generated our hypothesis based on findings in Europe, however many invasive plant species on the American continent originate from Asia 
    <sup>42,43</sup>, thus it would be interesting to test our hypothesis based on land use patterns from these regions. "
