<p>This manuscript presents a simple and interesting hypothesis about how human activities could drive the increase in abundance of invasive species. It is based on two important observations; 1. Invasive species have in general higher abundances in their new environment than in the native ranges, and 2. The patterns of invasive species differ between invaded regions. The authors realized that human land management activities explain the difference in abundance of species, between both the invader and native range and between different invader regions. Specifically they put a new role for “human activities” into the second stage of plant invasion (

I think that it is an interesting hypothesis, which provides a new vision and background for future research on invasion ecology and conservation management. Finally, I have some suggestions that may help to a better understanding of this article and future development.
