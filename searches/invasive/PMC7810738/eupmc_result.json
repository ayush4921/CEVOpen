    "Nonhost resistance of Arabidopsis thaliana against the hemibiotrophic fungus Colletotrichum tropicale requires PEN2-dependent preinvasive resistance and CYP71A12 and CYP71A13-dependent postinvasive resistance, which both rely on tryptophan (Trp) metabolism. We here revealed that CYP71A12, CYP71A13 and PAD3 are critical for Arabidopsis' postinvasive basal resistance toward the necrotrophic Alternaria brassicicola. Consistent with this, gene expression and metabolite analyses suggested that the invasion by A. brassicicola triggered the CYP71A12-dependent production of indole-3-carboxylic acid derivatives and the PAD3 and CYP71A13-dependent production of camalexin. We next addressed the activation of the CYP71A12 and PAD3-dependent postinvasive resistance. We found that bak1-5 mutation significantly reduced postinvasive resistance against A. brassicicola, indicating that pattern recognition contributes to activation of this second defense-layer. However, the bak1-5 mutation had no detectable effects on the Trp-metabolism triggered by the fungal penetration. Together with this, further comparative gene expression analyses suggested that pathogen invasion in Arabidopsis activates (1) CYP71A12 and PAD3-related antifungal metabolism that is not hampered by bak1-5, and (2) a bak1-5 sensitive immune pathway that activates the expression of antimicrobial proteins."
