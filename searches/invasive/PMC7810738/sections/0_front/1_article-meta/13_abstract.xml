 <p id="Par1">Nonhost resistance of 
  <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> against the hemibiotrophic fungus 
  <italic>Colletotrichum tropicale</italic> requires PEN2-dependent preinvasive resistance and CYP71A12 and CYP71A13-dependent postinvasive resistance, which both rely on tryptophan (Trp) metabolism. We here revealed that CYP71A12, CYP71A13 and PAD3 are critical for 
  <italic>Arabidopsisâ€™</italic> postinvasive basal resistance toward the necrotrophic 
  <italic>Alternaria brassicicola</italic>. Consistent with this, gene expression and metabolite analyses suggested that the invasion by 
  <italic>A. brassicicola</italic> triggered the CYP71A12-dependent production of indole-3-carboxylic acid derivatives and the PAD3 and CYP71A13-dependent production of camalexin. We next addressed the activation of the CYP71A12 and PAD3-dependent postinvasive resistance. We found that 
  <italic>bak1</italic>-
  <italic>5</italic> mutation significantly reduced postinvasive resistance against 
  <italic>A</italic>. 
  <italic>brassicicola</italic>, indicating that pattern recognition contributes to activation of this second defense-layer. However, the 
  <italic>bak1</italic>-
  <italic>5</italic> mutation had no detectable effects on the Trp-metabolism triggered by the fungal penetration. Together with this, further comparative gene expression analyses suggested that pathogen invasion in 
  <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> activates (1) CYP71A12 and PAD3-related antifungal metabolism that is not hampered by 
  <italic>bak1</italic>-
  <italic>5</italic>, and (2) a 
  <italic>bak1</italic>-
  <italic>5</italic> sensitive immune pathway that activates the expression of antimicrobial proteins.
