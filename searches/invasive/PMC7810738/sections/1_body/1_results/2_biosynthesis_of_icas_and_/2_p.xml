<p id="Par12">We found that the expression of 
 <italic>CYP71A12</italic> and 
 <italic>PAD3</italic> started to be induced at 12 hpi in 
 <italic>pen2</italic>, and the corresponding expression levels were stronger elevated at later time points (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). By contrast, we did not detect any induction at 4 hpi (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). In parallel, we also investigated the temporal infection behavior of 
 <italic>Ab</italic> in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. We found that conidia of 
 <italic>Ab</italic> had already germinated at 4 hpi, however, we did not detect any host invasion at this time (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). The fungus started to invade the 
 <italic>pen2</italic> plants at 12 hpi and the invasion ratio became elevated at later time points (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B,D). These findings indicate a link between 
 <italic>CYP71A12</italic> and 
 <italic>PAD3</italic> induction and the initiation of host invasion in the 
 <italic>Ab</italic>-
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> interactions, strongly suggesting that the expressions of 
 <italic>CYP71A12</italic> and 
 <italic>PAD3</italic> are triggered by 
 <italic>Ab</italic> invasion. Furthermore, we also revealed that simultaneous loss of both 
 <italic>CYP71A12</italic> and 
 <italic>CYP71A13</italic> produced no detectable effects on the preinvasive resistance against 
 <italic>Ab</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C,D). These findings suggest that 
 <italic>CYP71A12</italic> and 
 <italic>CYP71A13</italic> are involved in the postinvasive resistance against 
 <italic>Ab</italic>. We also found that the invasion ratio of 
 <italic>Ab</italic> in 
 <italic>pen2</italic> was not significantly different from that in WT (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C), in contrast to the case of 
 <italic>Ctro</italic>
