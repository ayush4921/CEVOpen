 </sup> reported that (1) the expression of 
 <italic>CYP71A12</italic> and 
 <italic>PAD3</italic> is strongly induced in the 
 <italic>pen2</italic> mutant defective in preinvasive resistance, but not in WT, upon the inoculation of the non-adapted pathogen 
 <italic>Ctro</italic> and (2) 
 <italic>CYP71A12</italic> and 
 <italic>PAD3</italic> are involved in postinvasive resistance against 
 <italic>Ctro</italic>. To assess whether 
 <italic>CYP71A12</italic> and 
 <italic>PAD3</italic> are expressed during postinvasive resistance against 
 <italic>Ab</italic>, we investigated the expression pattern of these genes at several time points after 
 <italic>Ab</italic> inoculation (at 4, 12, 24, and 48 h postinoculation, hpi). Although lesion development by 
 <italic>Ab</italic> in 
 <italic>pen2</italic> was comparable to that in WT (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), we used the 
 <italic>pen2</italic> mutant for the analysis to exclude a potential contribution of PEN2 to preinvasive resistance to 
 <italic>Ab.</italic>
