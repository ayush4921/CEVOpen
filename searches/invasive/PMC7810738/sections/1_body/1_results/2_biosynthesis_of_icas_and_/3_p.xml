<p id="Par13">We then assessed whether our observations made at the gene expression level could be supported with metabolite profiles. We found that the pathogen-induced accumulation of two ICAs, glucoside of 6-hydroxy-indole-3-carboxylic acid (6OGlcICA) and glucose ester of indole-3-carboxylic acid (ICAGlc), was detected at 24 hpi, but not at 4 hpi with

 <italic>pen2</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>), which matched strongly with the gene expression data (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). Similar results were also obtained during the analysis of camalexin accumulation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). Therefore, we conclude that the synthesis of ICAs and camalexin is triggered by 
 <italic>Ab</italic> invasion.
