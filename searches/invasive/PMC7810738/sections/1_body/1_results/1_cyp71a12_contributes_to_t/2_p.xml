<p id="Par10">We also found that the 
 <italic>pen2 pad3</italic> mutants have increased susceptibility to the 
 <italic>Ab</italic> Ryo-1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), indicating the importance of PAD3-dependent camalexin synthesis, consistent with previous reports

 </sup>. Also, an additional mutation in 
 <italic>CYP71A13</italic> further increased lesion development in 
 <italic>pen2 cyp71A12</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Opposite with 
 <italic>PAD3</italic> and 
 <italic>CYP71A12/A13</italic>, 
 <italic>cyp82C2</italic> mutation did not cause significant changes in 
 <italic>Ab</italic> development suggesting that 
 <italic>CYP82C2</italic> together with 4-OH-ICN do not contribute to the immunity toward this pathogen (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We were unable to perform proper quantitative analysis of lesion development in the 
 <italic>cyp79B2 cyp79B3</italic> mutant at 4 dpi because the lesions had already merged. However, quantitative analysis at 3 dpi revealed that the 
 <italic>cyp79B2 cyp79B3</italic> mutant was the most susceptible to 
 <italic>Ab</italic> among all tested genotypes (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). As 
 <italic>PEN2</italic> appeared to be unlikely essential for the immunity against 
 <italic>Ab</italic>, we also investigated the effects of the mutations of 
 <italic>PAD3</italic>, 
 <italic>CYP71A12</italic>, 
 <italic>CYP71A13</italic> and 
 <italic>CYP82C2</italic> on the immunity to 
 <italic>Ab</italic> in the WT background in addition to the 
 <italic>pen2</italic> background by using 
 <italic>pad3</italic>, 
 <italic>cyp82C2</italic>, 
 <italic>cyp71A12</italic>, 
 <italic>cyp71A12 cyp71A13</italic> mutants. The obtained result was similar to the finding on the mutations in the 
 <italic>pen2</italic> background (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>).
