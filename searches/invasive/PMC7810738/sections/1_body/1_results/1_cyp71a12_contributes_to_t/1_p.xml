 <italic>Ab</italic> is a necrotrophic fungal pathogen that infects several Brassicaceae spp., including cabbage and canola but is restricted within limited lesions when inoculated on leaves of

 </sup>. To investigate the roles of CYP71A12 in the postinvasive immunity of 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> against 
 <italic>Ab</italic>, we used the Ryo-1 strain of 
 <italic>Ab</italic> for the inoculation assay (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). During our former study on postinvasive resistance against 
 <italic>Ctro</italic> we investigated Trp metabolism-related mutants including 
 <italic>cyp71A12</italic> in the 
 <italic>pen2</italic> background, because 
 <italic>Ctro</italic> was not able to invade these mutants in the absence of the 
 <italic>pen2</italic> mutation (15). In this study, to focus on postinvasive resistance against 
 <italic>Ab,</italic> we used these 
 <italic>pen2</italic> background mutants for the 
 <italic>Ab</italic> inoculation assay to exclude a potential effect of PEN2 on preinvasive resistance against this pathogen. Our evaluation of lesion development at 4 days postinoculation (dpi) revealed that the 
 <italic>pen2 cyp71A12</italic> mutant showed enhanced susceptibility to 
 <italic>Ab,</italic> as compared with the 
 <italic>pen2</italic> plants, indicating contribution of CYP71A12 to the immunity towards 
 <italic>Ab</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We also found that lesion development in the 
 <italic>pen2</italic> mutant was not significantly different from that in the wild-type (WT) Col-0 leaves (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), suggesting that opposite with the impact on several filamentous pathogens

 </sup>, PEN2 has likely no detectable contribution to the 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> immunity against 
 <italic>Ab</italic> at least in the Col-0 accession.
