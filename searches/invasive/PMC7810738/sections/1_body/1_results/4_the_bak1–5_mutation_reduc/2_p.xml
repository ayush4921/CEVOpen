<p id="Par19">Because the main results on gene expression and metabolite accumulation were derived from the 
 <italic>pen2</italic>-background mutants in this study, we used the 
 <italic>pen2 bak1–4</italic> mutant
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup> and the newly generated 
 <italic>pen2 bak1–5</italic> mutant. We first performed 
 <italic>Ab</italic> inoculation assay on these plant lines and found that both 
 <italic>pen2 bak1–4</italic> and 
 <italic>pen2 bak1–5</italic> plants have reduced immunity to 
 <italic>Ab</italic>, although the 
 <italic>pen2 bak1–5</italic> plants were more susceptible than the 
 <italic>pen2 bak1–4</italic> plants (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A,C). Similar results were observed for single 
 <italic>bak1–4</italic> and 
 <italic>bak1–5</italic> as compared with WT plants (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>). We then evaluated whether the 
 <italic>bak1–5</italic> mutation would reduce preinvasive resistance to 
 <italic>Ab</italic>. To assess this, we compared the invasion behavior of 
 <italic>Ab</italic> in the 
 <italic>pen2</italic> mutant with that in the 
 <italic>pen2 bak1–5</italic> mutant. The invasion ratio in the 
 <italic>pen2 bak1–5</italic> mutant was similar to that in the 
 <italic>pen2</italic> mutant, suggesting that the 
 <italic>bak1–5</italic> mutation does not have detectable impact on preinvasive resistance to 
 <italic>Ab</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). These results indicate that the 
 <italic>bak1–5</italic> mutation reduces postinvasive resistance to 
 <italic>Ab</italic>, i.e., PRR systems likely function in the recognition of 
 <italic>Ab</italic> invasion.
