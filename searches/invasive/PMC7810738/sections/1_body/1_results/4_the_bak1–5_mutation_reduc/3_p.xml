<p id="Par20">Because we found that the 
 <italic>bak1–5</italic> mutation reduced postinvasive resistance to 
 <italic>Ab</italic>, we next investigated whether 
 <italic>bak1–5</italic> would have negative effects on the 
 <italic>Ab</italic> invasion-triggered activation of camalexin and ICAs biosynthesis. We checked the gene expression of 
 <italic>PAD3</italic> and 
 <italic>CYP71A12</italic> in the 
 <italic>pen2</italic> and 
 <italic>pen2 bak1–5</italic> mutants after 
 <italic>Ab</italic> inoculation. Surprisingly, the 
 <italic>bak1–5</italic> mutation did not cancel the induced expression of 
 <italic>PAD3</italic> and 
 <italic>CYP71A12</italic> in 
 <italic>pen2</italic> (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A, 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). Furthermore, we found that the accumulation of camalexin and ICAs upon 
 <italic>Ab</italic> invasion was not reduced in the 
 <italic>pen2 bak1–5</italic> mutant compared with the 
 <italic>pen2</italic> mutant (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S8</xref>). The accumulation level of ICAs was even higher in 
 <italic>pen2 bak1–5</italic> than 
 <italic>pen2</italic> at 48 hpi, which might be due to enhanced infection in 
 <italic>pen2 bak1–5</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S8</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that the 
 <italic>bak1–5</italic> mutation does not reduce the 
 <italic>Ab</italic>-triggered activation of camalexin and ICAs biosynthesis, although this mutation reduces postinvasive resistance to 
 <italic>Ab</italic>.
