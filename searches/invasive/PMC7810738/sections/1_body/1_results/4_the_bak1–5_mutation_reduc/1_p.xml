<p id="Par18">Next, we asked how 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> recognizes the invasion by 
 <italic>Ab</italic> to activate the biosynthesis of ICAs and camalexin. The candidate mechanism critical for this process is the PRRs-dependent PAMP recognition machinery
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup>. When 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> recognizes PAMPs, at least some of the cognate PRRs, including FLS2 and EFR receptor-like kinases (RLKs), form complexes with coreceptors such as BAK1
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, we decided to assess the possible involvement of BAK1 in the invasion-triggered accumulation of ICAs and camalexin. For this purpose, we used two mutant alleles of 
 <italic>BAK1</italic>, 
 <italic>bak1–4</italic> and 
 <italic>bak1–5</italic>; of these, 
 <italic>bak1–4</italic> is a 
 <italic>BAK1</italic> null allele
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup>, and 
 <italic>bak1–5</italic> is a semi-dominant allele with a specific phenotype related to PAMP responsiveness
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>. Importantly, it was reported that 
 <italic>bak1-5</italic> is more severely impaired in elf18 and flg22 responses than the null mutant 
 <italic>bak1-4</italic>
