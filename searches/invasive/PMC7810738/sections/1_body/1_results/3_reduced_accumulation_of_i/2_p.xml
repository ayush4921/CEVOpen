<p id="Par15">Obtained results revealed that the simultaneous loss of 
 <italic>CYP79B2</italic> and 
 <italic>CYP79B3</italic> completely abolished the 
 <italic>Ab</italic>-triggered accumulation of ICAs and camalexin, whereas the loss of 
 <italic>PAD3</italic> canceled camalexin accumulation, but had no effects on the accumulation of ICAs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). In the 
 <italic>pen2 cyp71A12</italic> mutant, the 
 <italic>Ab</italic>-triggered accumulation of ICAs was reduced significantly compared with the 
 <italic>pen2</italic> mutant, opposite with camalexin accumulation that was rather increased compared with 
 <italic>pen2</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). These results further strengthen the idea that the accumulation of ICAs triggered by the 
 <italic>Ab</italic> invasion is critical for the postinvasive resistance of 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> against this necrotrophic fungal pathogen. In the 
 <italic>pen2 cyp71A12 cyp71A13</italic> mutant, the ICA levels that accumulated upon 
 <italic>Ab</italic> invasion were similar to those observed in the 
 <italic>pen2 cyp71A12</italic> mutant, but camalexin accumulation in the triple mutant was completely diminished, in contrast to 
 <italic>pen2 cyp71A12</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>), further supporting the importance of CYP71A13 for the pathogen-induced accumulation of camalexin, but not ICAs.
