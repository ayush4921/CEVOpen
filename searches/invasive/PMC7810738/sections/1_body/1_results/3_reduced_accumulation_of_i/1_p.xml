<p id="Par14">We have reported recently that the accumulation of ICAs triggered by inoculation with 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>cucumerina</italic> is reduced in the 
 <italic>cyp71A12</italic>, but not in the 
 <italic>cyp71A13</italic> mutant

 </sup>. By contrast, the 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>cucumerina</italic>-triggered accumulation of camalexin was reduced in the 
 <italic>cyp71A13</italic>, but not in the single 
 <italic>cyp71A12</italic> mutant
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, we assumed that the CYP71A12-dependent production of ICAs contributes to 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> postinvasive immunity to 
 <italic>Ab</italic> independently of CYP71A13-dependent camalexin production. As mentioned above, we also found that the 
 <italic>cyp79B2 cyp79B3</italic> mutant exhibited more severe defects in postinvasive resistance against 
 <italic>Ab</italic> than the 
 <italic>pen2 cyp71A12 cyp71A13</italic> mutant (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>), although the reason was not clear. To get further insights on these aspects, we investigated the Trp-related metabolite profiles of the aforementioned mutants: 
 <italic>pen2</italic>, 
 <italic>pen2 pad3</italic>, 
 <italic>pen2 cyp71A12</italic>, 
 <italic>pen2 cyp71A12 cyp71A13</italic>, and 
 <italic>cyp79B2 cyp79B3</italic>.
