<p id="Par16">It is noteworthy that the leaves of 
 <italic>pen2 cyp71A12 cyp71A13</italic> mutant still accumulated clearly detectable amounts of ICAs at both 24 hpi and 48 hpi of 
 <italic>Ab</italic>, whereas camalexin in this triple mutant was under the detection limit at the same time points (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). As mentioned above, the 
 <italic>cyp79B2 cyp79B3</italic> mutant exhibited a more severe phenotype to 
 <italic>Ab</italic> inoculation compared with the 
 <italic>pen2 cyp71A12 cyp71A13</italic> mutant (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A,B; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The 
 <italic>cyp79B2 cyp79B3</italic> mutant is entirely defective in the production of not only camalexin, but also ICAs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). Also, both 
 <italic>cyp79B2 cyp79B3</italic> and 
 <italic>pen2 cyp71A12 cyp71A13</italic> mutants are commonly defective in biosynthesis of the PEN2-dependent IG-hydrolysis products (leading to unidentified antifungal compounds), these data suggested that the different levels of susceptibility to 
 <italic>Ab</italic> between 
 <italic>pen2 cyp71A12 cyp71A13</italic> and 
 <italic>cyp79B2 cyp79B3</italic> is likely caused by the differential accumulation of ICAs in these two mutants.
