 </sup>. The 
 <italic>pen2 cyp71A12 cyp71A13</italic> mutant lacks the PEN2-dependent IG-hydrolysis products, but retains the ability to produce IGs, which can be activated by another enzyme. It has been reported that IG biosynthesis in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> is controlled by the transcription factors MYB34, MYB51, and MYB122, whereas these factors are dispensable for the pathogen triggered biosynthesis of camalexin and ICAs

 </sup>. Thus, to assess the possibility that the different susceptibility to 
 <italic>Ab</italic> between 
 <italic>pen2 cyp71A12 cyp71A13</italic> and 
 <italic>cyp79B2 cyp79B3</italic> mutants might be linked to IG biosynthesis, we compared phenotypes of 
 <italic>pen2 cyp71A12 cyp71A13</italic> and 
 <italic>cyp71A12 cyp71A13 myb34 myb51 myb122</italic> lines following 
 <italic>Ab</italic> inoculation. We first performed the metabolite analyses on the 
 <italic>cyp71A12 cyp71A13 myb34 myb51 myb122</italic> mutant leaves at 24 hpi of 
 <italic>Ab</italic> (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>)
 <italic>.</italic> The obtained results showed that this mutant was defective in IG biosynthesis upon 
 <italic>Ab</italic> infection. Subsequently, we tested susceptibility of this mutant towards 
 <italic>Ab</italic> in an inoculation assay. We found that lesion development in the 
 <italic>cyp71A12 cyp71A13 myb34 myb51 myb122</italic> mutant leaves was similar to that in the 
 <italic>pen2 cyp71A12 cyp71A13</italic> mutant (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). These results indicate that PEN2-independent IG hydrolysis is likely not involved in the postinvasive resistance against 
 <italic>Ab</italic>. Thus, the different susceptibility between the 
 <italic>pen2 cyp71A12 cyp71A13</italic> mutant and the 
 <italic>cyp79B2 cyp79B3</italic> mutant is not linked to IG-deficiency. Together with the involvement of CYP71A12-dependent ICAs synthesis in the postinvasive resistance of 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> against 
 <italic>Ab</italic>, we consider that the remaining ICAs in 
 <italic>pen2 cyp71A12 cyp71A13</italic> are still effective against 
 <italic>Ab.</italic> Consistent with this idea, the 
 <italic>pen2 cyp71A12</italic> mutant was more susceptible to 
 <italic>Ab</italic> than the 
 <italic>pen2</italic> mutant (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).
