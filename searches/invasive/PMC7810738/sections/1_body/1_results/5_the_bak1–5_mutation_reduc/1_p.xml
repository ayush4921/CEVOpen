<p id="Par21">We further investigated the 
 <italic>bak1–5</italic> sensitive pathways for postinvasive resistance against 
 <italic>Ab</italic>. We performed comparative expression profiling experiments in 
 <italic>pen2</italic> and 
 <italic>pen2 bak1–5</italic> plants following 
 <italic>Ab</italic> invasion using microarray analysis. 
 <italic>Ab</italic> was inoculated to each plant, and RNA isolated from inoculated leaves at 24 hpi was subjected to microarray analysis. We focused on differentially expressed genes associated with the immune response based on Gene Ontology (GO) data (GO term 0006955: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.informatics.jax.org</ext-link>). As a result, we found that 14 genes had greater than a 2.5-fold change in expression. Interestingly, 11 were down-regulated, and three were up-regulated (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>), implying that, compared with the 
 <italic>pen2</italic> plants, the 
 <italic>pen2 bak1–5</italic> plants exhibited a trend for reduced immune responses upon 
 <italic>Ab</italic> invasion. Among the 11 down-regulated genes, four were shown previously to be involved in the 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> immune system using functional analyses such as the analysis of corresponding knockout mutants, including 
 <italic>AED1</italic> (
 <italic>APOPLASTIC, EDS1-DEPENDENT 1</italic>)

 <italic>glip1</italic> plants were reported to be more susceptible to 
 <italic>Ab</italic> than the WT plant

 </sup>. Subsequently, we performed reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT–qPCR) analyses to investigate the expression levels of these four genes (
 <italic>AED1</italic>, 
 <italic>BGL2</italic>/
 <italic>PR2</italic>, 
 <italic>GLIP1</italic>, and 
 <italic>RLP23</italic>) at 4, 12, 24, and 48 hpi in 
 <italic>pen2</italic> and 
 <italic>pen2 bak1–5</italic> plants inoculated with 
 <italic>Ab</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). As a control, we also investigated gene expression in the mock-treated plants. We confirmed that these four genes exhibited lower expression in the 
 <italic>pen2 bak1–5</italic> than in the 
 <italic>pen2</italic> mutant at 24 hpi, consistent with the array data. Furthermore, the RT–qPCR analysis revealed that the expression of 
 <italic>AED1</italic>, 
 <italic>BGL2</italic>/
 <italic>PR2</italic>, 
 <italic>GLIP1</italic>, and 
 <italic>RLP23</italic> was lower at 4 hpi than at 12, 24, and 48 hpi (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Together with our finding that 
 <italic>Ab</italic> did not invade at 4 hpi, but started to invade at 12 hpi (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B), our results indicate that these genes are induced upon 
 <italic>Ab</italic> invasion to function in postinvasive resistance. Such induced expression was continuously suppressed in the 
 <italic>pen2 bak1–5</italic> plants (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), further suggesting that this invasion-triggered expression depends on putative PRRs with function impaired in the 
 <italic>bak1–5</italic> mutant. It is also noteworthy that the invasion-triggered expressions of 
 <italic>AED1</italic>, 
 <italic>BGL2</italic>/
 <italic>PR2</italic>, 
 <italic>GLIP1</italic>, and 
 <italic>RLP23</italic> were time-dependent, i.e., induced expression started to be down-regulated at 12 hpi (
 <italic>RLP23</italic>) or 24 hpi (
 <italic>AED1</italic>, 
 <italic>BGL2</italic>/
 <italic>PR2</italic>, 
 <italic>GLIP1</italic>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), which is in contrast to the invasion-triggered expressions of 
 <italic>PAD3</italic> and 
 <italic>CYP71A12</italic>, which exhibited sustained elevations for up to 48 hpi (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A, 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A).
