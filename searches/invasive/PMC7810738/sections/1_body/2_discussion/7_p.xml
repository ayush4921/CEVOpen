<p id="Par28">We also investigated how 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> recognizes the invasion of fungal pathogens and then mounts its postinvasive resistance. We found that the two 
 <italic>bak1</italic> mutations, especially the 
 <italic>bak1–5</italic> mutation, reduce postinvasive resistance against 
 <italic>Ab</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The finding that the negative effects of 
 <italic>bak1-5</italic> on the postinvasive resistance towards 
 <italic>Ab</italic> was higher than that of 
 <italic>bak1-4</italic> is likely consistent with the previous works
