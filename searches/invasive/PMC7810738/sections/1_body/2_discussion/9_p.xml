<p id="Par30">Notably, it has been reported that the 
 <italic>glip1</italic> mutant plants exhibit enhanced susceptibility to 
 <italic>Ab</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup>. The recombinant GLIP1 protein exhibits antimicrobial activity that disrupts the 
 <italic>Ab</italic> spores and hyphae
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup> and triggers systemic acquired resistance against bacterial pathogens (e.g., 
 <italic>Erwinia carotovora</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic>) as well as 
 <italic>Ab</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, the enhanced susceptibility of 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> to 
 <italic>Ab</italic> in the presence of 
 <italic>bak1â€“5</italic> might be partially caused by the reduced expression of 
 <italic>GLIP1</italic>.
