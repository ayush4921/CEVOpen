<p id="Par23">Here we found that the absence of functional CYP71A12 enhanced lesion development during colonization of 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves with the necrotrophic pathogen 
 <italic>Ab</italic>, indicating that this enzyme is required for the immune response of 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> against this fungus. 
 <italic>CYP71A12</italic> was not induced at 4 hpi with 
 <italic>Ab</italic> when the pathogen had not yet invaded, but it started to be induced upon 
 <italic>Ab</italic> invasion (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). We also found that 
 <italic>CYP71A12</italic> was dispensable for preinvasive resistance against 
 <italic>Ab</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C). Collectively, these results demonstrate that 
 <italic>CYP71A12</italic> is required for postinvasive resistance against 
 <italic>Ab</italic> as well as 
 <italic>Ctro</italic>. Metabolic analyses showed that the enhanced accumulation of ICAs triggered by 
 <italic>Ab</italic> invasion was reduced in the absence of functional CYP71A12. Thus, this enzyme is involved in the accumulation of ICAs following 
 <italic>Ab</italic> invasion (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). Therefore, we consider that the CYP71A12-dependent synthesis of ICA and/or its derivatives upon 
 <italic>Ab</italic> invasion is critical for postinvasive resistance to this fungus.
