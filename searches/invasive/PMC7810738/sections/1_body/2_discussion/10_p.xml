<p id="Par31">It remains unclear how 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plant recognizes pathogen invasion and then activates Trp-related metabolite accumulation as key immune responses in postinvasive resistance. Because 
 <italic>PAD3</italic> and 
 <italic>CYP71A12</italic> were commonly induced by the invasion of diverse fungal pathogens such as 
 <italic>Ab</italic> and 
 <italic>Ctro</italic>, we suggest that 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> probably recognizes the cell damage that is commonly caused by pathogen invasion and then activates Trp-related metabolism. Further studies are needed to explore a recognition mechanism of pathogen invasion that activates these secondary metabolic pathways for antifungal defense.
