 <italic>Ab</italic> (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C,D). Furthermore, PEN1 is known to be required for preinvasive resistance against nonadapted powdery mildews
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>
 </sup>, but dispensable for the 
 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> fungi and nonadapted 
 <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup>. It is also noteworthy that PEN2 is involved in preinvasive resistance against 
 <italic>A. alternata</italic>, in contrast with 
 <italic>Ab</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, the molecular components that underlie preinvasive resistance vary between fungal pathogens, probably because pathogens have evolved various strategies for plant entry. By contrast, once these pathogens enter 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, they commonly develop invasive structures inside the plants; thus, the hosts might deploy an universal defense systems to terminate further fungal growth.
