 <italic>Ab</italic> invasion revealed that camalexin accumulation in the 
 <italic>pen2 cyp71A12 cyp71A13</italic> plants was almost the same as that in the 
 <italic>cyp79B2 cyp79B3</italic> plants (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). Importantly, the 
 <italic>pen2 cyp71A1 cyp71A13</italic> plants reduced their accumulation of ICAs, but still produced them to some degree, whereas the 
 <italic>cyp79B2 cyp79B3</italic> plants were entirely defective in this regard (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). Consistent with this finding, several independent metabolic branches are supposed to contribute to endogenous ICAs levels, including contribution of Arabidopsis aldehyde oxidase 1 and CYP71B6
