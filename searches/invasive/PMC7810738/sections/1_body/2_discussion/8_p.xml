<p id="Par29">Surprisingly, we found that the 
 <italic>bak1–5</italic> mutation did not hamper the invasion-triggered expressions of 
 <italic>PAD3</italic> and 
 <italic>CYP71A12</italic> and the subsequent accumulation of ICAs and camalexin (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Thus, we postulate existence of another defense mechanism that is affected by the 
 <italic>bak1–5</italic> mutation and required for postinvasive resistance against 
 <italic>Ab</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Our further analyses revealed that this pathogen activates the expression of distinct defense-related genes, including 
 <italic>AED1</italic>, 
 <italic>BGL2/PR2</italic>, 
 <italic>GLIP1</italic>, and 
 <italic>RLP23</italic> (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Notably, expressions of these genes were induced following 
 <italic>Ab</italic> invasion, and these were canceled in 
 <italic>bak1–5</italic> mutants (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Therefore, we suggest that 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> deploys a PRR system to sense the invasion of 
 <italic>Ab</italic> and subsequently activate antifungal defense pathways that are uncoupled from the Trp-metabolism (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).
