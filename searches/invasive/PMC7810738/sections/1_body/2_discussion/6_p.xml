<p id="Par27">We also compared the phenotype of 
 <italic>pen2 cyp71A12 cyp71A13</italic> mutants with that of 
 <italic>myb34 myb51 myb122 cyp71A12 cyp71A13</italic> following 
 <italic>Ab</italic> invasion and found no detectable differences in either mutants in terms of postinvasive resistance against 
 <italic>Ab</italic>, indicating that the difference between 
 <italic>pen2 cyp71A12 cyp71A13</italic> and 
 <italic>cyp79B2 cyp79B3</italic> mutants is not caused by PEN2-unrelated IG metabolism products (Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggest that the lower susceptibility in the former mutants is caused by residual ICAs, i.e., ICAs contribute to postinvasive resistance in a dose-dependent manner. This supports the idea that ICAs or their derivatives work as antifungal compounds as opposed to functioning as signaling molecules for plant immune responses. However, we cannot exclude a possibility that accumulation of so far not-reported IAOx-derivatives whose biosynthesis is not dependent on CYP71A12 and CYP71A13 contribute to the difference observed in susceptibility of 
 <italic>pen2 cyp71A12 cyp71A13</italic> and 
 <italic>cyp79B2 cyp79B3</italic> plants.
