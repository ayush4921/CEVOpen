<p id="Par6">Immune responses in plants, including biosynthesis of specialized metabolites, can be triggered by pattern recognition-receptor (PRRs). BAK1 (BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE 1) is known to act as a coreceptor with multiple PRRs, including FLS2 and EFR, via ligand-induced heteromerization

 </sup>. BAK1 was initially identified as a positive regulator of the brassinosteroid response (BR)

 <italic>bak1</italic> null mutants such as 
 <italic>bak1-4</italic> mutant have a defect not only in FLS2 and EFR-dependent immune responses, but are also hyposensitive to BR. In contrast to the null alleles, the 
 <italic>bak1–5</italic> allele is impaired in pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity, but not in BR signaling

 <italic>bak1-5</italic> is more severely impaired in defense responses than the null mutant
