<p id="Par7">Here, we investigated whether CYP71A12-dependent synthesis of ICAs might be involved in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> immunity, especially postinvasive resistance, to 
 <italic>Ab</italic> that infects Brassicaceae plants. As a result, we found that the invasion by 
 <italic>Ab</italic> triggers the CYP71A12-dependent accumulation of ICAs as well as camalexin. Furthermore, evaluation of lesion development and microscopic observation of the pathogen invasion suggested the involvement of CYP71A12, together with PAD3, in postinvasive resistance to 
 <italic>Ab</italic>.
