<p id="Par8">We also asked how 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> recognizes 
 <italic>Ab</italic> invasion to activate the CYP71A12 and PAD3-dependent postinvasive resistance. To this end we investigated function of BAK1 in immunity and ICAs formation and found that the two 
 <italic>bak1</italic> mutations, especially 
 <italic>bak1–5</italic>, reduce postinvasive resistance to 
 <italic>Ab</italic>, revealing the involvement of a PRR system in the recognition of 
 <italic>Ab</italic> invasion for the activation of defense. Unexpectedly, we found that the 
 <italic>bak1–5</italic> mutation has no negative impact on the invasion-triggered activation of biosynthesis of camalexin or ICAs derived from Trp.
