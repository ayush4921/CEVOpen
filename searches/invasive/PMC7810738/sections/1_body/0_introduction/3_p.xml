<p id="Par4">In addition to serving as a precursor of IGs and camalexin, IAOx can be also converted to indole-3-carboxylic acid and its derivatives (ICAs). We have shown recently that CYP71A12 but not CYP71A13 has an important contribution to the accumulation of ICAs in leaves upon both 
 <italic>Ctro</italic> and 
 <italic>P</italic>.

 <italic>Ctro,</italic> whereas CYP71A12 and PAD3 are dispensable for the preinvasive resistance: 
 <italic>Ctro</italic> cannot invade the 
 <italic>pad3</italic> single mutant or the
