 <italic>Ab</italic>, 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> conidia/mL of conidial suspension was spray-inoculated on 4–5-week-old plants. For drop-inoculation, 5 μL of conidial suspensions of 
 <italic>Ab</italic> (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> conidia/mL) were placed onto each leaf. The inoculated plants were kept at 25 °C with a cycle of 16 h light and 8 h dark and maintained at 100% relative humidity. For analysis of lesion development following the inoculation of 
 <italic>Ab</italic>, four drops of 5 μL conidial suspension of each pathogen were drop-inoculated on each leaf, and 24–50 lesions were evaluated in each experiment. The developed lesions were quantified using ImageJ image analysis software (

To measure lesion areas, yellowish areas were included as lesions. Trypan blue staining was conducted according to the method previously described

 </sup>. For the trypan blue assay, at least 50 lesions were investigated in each experiment. The 
 <italic>Ab</italic> invasion ratio (%) was calculated by using the following formula: 
 <italic>Ab</italic> invasion ratio (%) = (number of germinating conidia that developed invasive hyphae / number of germinating conidia) × 100.
