 <italic>Ab</italic> conidial suspensions (5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> conidia/mL) were spray-inoculated onto 4–5-week-old plants of the 
 <italic>pen2</italic> and 
 <italic>pen2 bak1–5</italic> mutants. For each sample, five leaves were collected at 24 hpi and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. In total, eight samples (four biological replicates each of the mock and 
 <italic>Ab</italic>-treated samples) were used for RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted using Plant RNA Isolation Mini kits (Agilent Technologies., Santa Clara, CA, USA). Aliquots of 200 ng of total RNA were used to prepare Cy3-labeled cRNA using Agilent Low Input Quick Amp labeling kits. The labeled samples were hybridized onto an Agilent 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> microarray (ver. 4.0; 4 × 44 K format). After hybridization and washing, the arrays were scanned using an Agilent microarray scanner (G2565BA). The images were analyzed using Agilent Feature Extraction software (ver. 10.7.3.1), and further analysis was performed using Agilent GeneSpring GX12.1 software. Signal normalization was based on the expression ratio of 
 <italic>pen2 bak1–5</italic> to 
 <italic>pen2</italic>. Differentially upregulated genes were defined as having a greater than 2.5-fold increase in expression, and differentially downregulated genes were defined as having at least a 0.4-fold decrease in expression. Microarray data have been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database GSE 124921.
