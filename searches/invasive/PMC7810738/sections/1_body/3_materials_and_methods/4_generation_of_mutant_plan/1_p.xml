<p id="Par35">The generation of 
 <italic>pen2 bak1–5</italic> line used in this study was generated by crossing the 
 <italic>pen2–1</italic> mutant with 
 <italic>bak1–5</italic> plants. The genotype was checked with the corresponding specific primers for the derived cleaved-amplified polymorphic sequence (dCAPS) markers using dCAPS Finder 2.0 (
