   <italic>PAD3</italic> and 
   <italic>CYP71A12</italic> are involved in the immunity of 
   <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> against the necrotrophic pathogen 
   <italic>Alternaria brassicicola</italic> (
   <italic>Ab</italic>). (
   <bold>A</bold>) Lesion development caused by 
   <italic>Ab</italic> on 
   <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutant plants with defects in Trp metabolism pathways. Conidial suspensions (1 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> conidia/mL) of 
   <italic>Ab</italic> were drop-inoculated onto mature leaves of 4–5-week-old plants. The photograph was taken at 4 days postinoculation (dpi). (
   <bold>B</bold>) Quantification of lesion development. Conidial suspensions of 
   <italic>Ab</italic> were drop-inoculated onto tested plants. At 4 dpi, lesion areas were measured and the relative values to Col-0 (WT plants) were calculated. Means and standard deviations (SDs) were calculated from three independent experiments. The statistical significance of differences between means was determined by Tukey’s honestly significant difference (HSD) test. Means not sharing the same letter are significantly different (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). N.D., not determined.
