 <caption> Summarized model for Arabidopsis postinvasive resistance against Ab. The CYP71A12-dependent production of ICAs is required for postinvasive resistance against A. brassicicola. The CYP71A13- and PAD3-dependent production of camalexin is also required for postinvasive resistance against Ab. The bak1 mutations (especially bak1-5) reduced the postinvasive resistance, however, invasion-triggered activation of these Trp-related pathways is not canceled by bak1-5. The bak1-5 sensitive pathway control the expression of antifungal protein genes (e.g. GLIP1). </caption>
