  <p>The 
   <italic>Ab</italic> invasion-triggered expression levels of 
   <italic>AED1</italic>, 
   <italic>BGL2/PR2</italic>, 
   <italic>GLIP1</italic>, and 
   <italic>RLP23</italic> were reduced by the 
   <italic>bak1–5</italic> mutation. Conidial suspensions (5 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> conidia/mL) of 
   <italic>Ab</italic> were spray-inoculated onto 4–5-week-old 
   <italic>pen2</italic> and 
   <italic>pen2 bak1–5</italic> plants, and then kept at 100% humidity. The samples were collected at 4, 12, 24, and 48 hpi. Each gene transcript was quantified by RT–qPCR using the gene-specific primers listed in Supplementary Table 
   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>. Values were normalized to the expression level of 
   <italic>UBC21</italic>. The means and SDs were calculated from three independent experiments. The statistical analysis was conducted by a two-tailed 
   <italic>t</italic> test. The expression levels of each gene between 
   <italic>pen2</italic> and 
   <italic>pen2 bak1–5</italic> were compared at the same time points and treatment (*
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; **
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01).
