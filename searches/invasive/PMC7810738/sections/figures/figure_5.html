 <caption> The bak1–5 mutation did not reduce the Ab-invasion triggered accumulation of 6-hydroxy-ICA and camalexin. ( A) The Ab-invasion triggered activation of CYP71A12 and PAD3 expression in the pen2 bak1–5 mutant. Conidial suspensions (5 × 10 5 conidia/mL) of Ab were spray-inoculated onto 4–5-week-old plants. The samples were collected at 4, 12, 24, and 48 hpi. Each gene transcript was quantified by RT–qPCR using the gene-specific primers listed in Supplementary Table S2. Values were normalized to the expression level of UBC21. The statistical comparison between Ab-treated pen2 and Ab-treated pen2 bak1-5 at same time point samples was conducted using two-tailed Student’s t tests and did not show significant differences. ( B) The Ab invasion-triggered accumulations of 6-hydroxy-ICA (6OGlcICA) and camalexin were not canceled by the bak1–5 mutation. Conidial suspensions (5 × 10 5 conidia/mL) of Ab were spray-inoculated onto the tested mutant lines. The means of metabolites (nmol/g FW) and SDs from four biological independent samples are shown in the graph. The statistical comparison between pen2 and pen2 bak1-5 at same timepoint was conducted using two-tailed Student’s t tests (** P &lt; 0.01). </caption>
