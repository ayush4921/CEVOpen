  <p>Summarized model for 
   <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> postinvasive resistance against 
   <italic>Ab</italic>. The CYP71A12-dependent production of ICAs is required for postinvasive resistance against 
   <italic>A. brassicicola</italic>. The CYP71A13- and PAD3-dependent production of camalexin is also required for postinvasive resistance against 
   <italic>Ab</italic>. The 
   <italic>bak1</italic> mutations (especially 
   <italic>bak1-5</italic>) reduced the postinvasive resistance, however, invasion-triggered activation of these Trp-related pathways is not canceled by 
   <italic>bak1-5</italic>. The 
   <italic>bak1-5</italic> sensitive pathway control the expression of antifungal protein genes (e.g. 
   <italic>GLIP1</italic>).
