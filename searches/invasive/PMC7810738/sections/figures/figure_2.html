 <caption> The invasion of Ab activates the expression of PAD3 and CYP71A12. ( A) Expression of PAD3 and CYP71A12 following Ab inoculation. Conidial suspensions (5 × 10 5 conidia/mL) of Ab were spray-inoculated onto 4–5-week-old pen2 plants and kept at 100% humidity. The samples were collected at 4, 12, 24, and 48 hpi. Each gene transcript was quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using the gene-specific primers listed in Supplementary Table S2. Values were normalized to the expression level of UBC21. The means and SDs were calculated from three independent experiments. Statistical comparisons between mock and Ab treated samples were conducted using two-tailed Student’s t tests (** P &lt; 0.01). ( B) Quantitative analysis of the Ab invasion ratio among pen2 plants. Conidial suspensions (1 × 10 5 conidia/mL) of Ab were drop-inoculated onto pen2 plants and kept at 100% humidity. The inoculated leaves were collected at 4, 12, 24, and 48 hpi, and then subjected to a trypan blue viability staining assay. The presence or absence of invasive hyphae from at least 50 germinating conidia were counted in each experiment. The means and SDs were calculated from three independent experiments. Statistical comparisons of the Ab invasion ratios at 12, 24, and 48 hpi against that at 4 hpi were conducted using two-tailed Student’s t tests (** P &lt; 0.01). ( C) PEN2, CYP71A12, and CYP71A13 are dispensable for preinvasive resistance against Ab. Aliquots of 5 μL of Ab conidial suspension were drop-inoculated onto leaves of 4–5-week-old plants. At 12 hpi, the inoculated leaves were collected and stained with trypan blue, and then invasive hyphae were observed by light microscopy. At least 50 germinating conidia were counted in each experiment. The means and SDs were calculated from three independent experiments. Statistical analysis using two-tailed Student’s t tests showed no significant differences among the genotypes. ( D) Light microscopy observations. At 12 hpi, a part of the germinating conidia developed invasive hyphae (arrows) inside the inoculated plants. The top images are focused on conidium and the bottom images are focused on invasive hypha. c conidium, g germ tube. Bars = 50 µm. </caption>
