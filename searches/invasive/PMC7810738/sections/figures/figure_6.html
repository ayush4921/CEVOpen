 <caption> The Ab invasion-triggered expression levels of AED1, BGL2/PR2, GLIP1, and RLP23 were reduced by the bak1–5 mutation. Conidial suspensions (5 × 10 5 conidia/mL) of Ab were spray-inoculated onto 4–5-week-old pen2 and pen2 bak1–5 plants, and then kept at 100% humidity. The samples were collected at 4, 12, 24, and 48 hpi. Each gene transcript was quantified by RT–qPCR using the gene-specific primers listed in Supplementary Table S2. Values were normalized to the expression level of UBC21. The means and SDs were calculated from three independent experiments. The statistical analysis was conducted by a two-tailed t test. The expression levels of each gene between pen2 and pen2 bak1–5 were compared at the same time points and treatment (* P &lt; 0.05; ** P &lt; 0.01). </caption>
