  <p>The 
   <italic>bak1–5</italic> mutation did not reduce the 
   <italic>Ab</italic>-invasion triggered accumulation of 6-hydroxy-ICA and camalexin. (
   <bold>A</bold>) The 
   <italic>Ab</italic>-invasion triggered activation of 
   <italic>CYP71A12</italic> and 
   <italic>PAD3</italic> expression in the 
   <italic>pen2 bak1–5</italic> mutant. Conidial suspensions (5 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> conidia/mL) of 
   <italic>Ab</italic> were spray-inoculated onto 4–5-week-old plants. The samples were collected at 4, 12, 24, and 48 hpi. Each gene transcript was quantified by RT–qPCR using the gene-specific primers listed in Supplementary Table 
   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>. Values were normalized to the expression level of 
   <italic>UBC21</italic>. The statistical comparison between 
   <italic>Ab</italic>-treated 
   <italic>pen2</italic> and 
   <italic>Ab</italic>-treated 
   <italic>pen2 bak1-5</italic> at same time point samples was conducted using two-tailed Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic> tests and did not show significant differences. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The 
   <italic>Ab</italic> invasion-triggered accumulations of 6-hydroxy-ICA (6OGlcICA) and camalexin were not canceled by the 
   <italic>bak1–5</italic> mutation. Conidial suspensions (5 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> conidia/mL) of 
   <italic>Ab</italic> were spray-inoculated onto the tested mutant lines. The means of metabolites (nmol/g FW) and SDs from four biological independent samples are shown in the graph. The statistical comparison between 
   <italic>pen2</italic> and 
   <italic>pen2 bak1-5</italic> at same timepoint was conducted using two-tailed Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic> tests (**
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01).
