  <p>Invasion by 
   <italic>Ab</italic> induced CYP71A12-dependent biosynthesis of 6-hydroxy-ICA and PAD3-dependent biosynthesis of camalexin. (
   <bold>A</bold>) The accumulation of 6-hydroxy-ICA (6OGlcICA) and camalexin in 
   <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants inoculated with 
   <italic>Ab</italic>. Conidial suspensions (5 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> conidia/mL) of 
   <italic>Ab</italic> were spray-inoculated onto Col-0 (WT) and 
   <italic>pen2</italic> plants. As a control, water was sprayed as a mock treatment. The means of metabolites (nmol/g fresh weight, FW) and SDs from four biological independent samples are shown in the graph. The statistical significance of differences between means was determined by Tukey’s HSD test. Means not sharing the same letter are significantly different (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). (

   <italic>CYP71A12</italic> is required for the 
   <italic>Ab</italic>-triggered accumulation of 6OGlcICA, whereas 
   <italic>PAD3</italic> and 
   <italic>CYP71A13</italic> are required for the accumulation of camalexin. Conidial suspensions (5 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> conidia/mL) of 
   <italic>Ab</italic> were spray-inoculated onto tested mutant lines. The statistical significance of differences between means in each time point was determined by Tukey’s HSD test. Means not sharing the same letter are significantly different (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05).
