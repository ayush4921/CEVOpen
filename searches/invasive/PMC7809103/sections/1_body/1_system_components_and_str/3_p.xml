 <italic>Busseola fusca</italic> and 
 <italic>S. calamistis</italic> females deposit the eggs between the leaf sheath and the stem of plant as a protection strategy against the environment and the natural enemies, whereas 
 <italic>C. partellus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> females deposit eggs directly on leaf surfaces

 </sup>. Upon emergence, the young larvae are dispersed by ballooning while older larvae disperse by crawling, resulting in a redistribution of the insect infestations within and between plants in maize fields

 <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> larvae feed only on leaves during their whole development, especially the central leaves in the plant whorl

 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> larvae can be found feeding on the tassels and subsequently on the ear, silk, cob and even in stemborer's holes

 </sup>. Therefore, 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> and stemborer larvae may interact by sharing the same niche at young developmental stages and even when the stemborer larvae migrate from the leaves to stems.
