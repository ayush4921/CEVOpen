   <p id="Par23">During the non-cropping season, only 10% of the pest found in maize fields survived on alternative host plants and will give rise to a new pest population in maize field during the subsequent cropping season.</p>

   <p id="Par24">A 3-month maize variety (Duma 43, Kenya Seed Company, Nairobi, Kenya) was considered to be used and grown from April to June and from October to December, periods corresponding to the yearly cropping seasons in Kenya.</p>

   <p id="Par25">Insect pests were recorded for the first time in the maize field 1 month after planting date.</p>
