<p id="Par37">The diagram of causalities represents the basic structure of the system of a given pest species with its associated parasitoids, where arrows show the cause–effect relations. A positive sign indicates direct proportionality of cause and effect, and the negative sign indicates a relation of inverse proportionality. The system is characterized by two negative feedbacks (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Loops B1 and B2) and one positive feedbacks (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A, Loop R1) leading to three main relationships:

  <list-item>
   <p id="Par38">as the resource (maize plants) increases, the growth of the pest increases to occupy the available resource resulting in the pest population increase;</p>

   <p id="Par39">as host availability increases, the probability that the parasitoid encounters its host increases, resulting in higher parasitism, increased host mortality rate and decreased pest population;</p>
