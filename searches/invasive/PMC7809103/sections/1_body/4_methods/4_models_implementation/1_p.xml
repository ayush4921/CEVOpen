<p id="Par36">The methodology here is rooted in system thinking approach with its archetypes [causal loop diagram (CLD), reinforcing (R) and balancing (B)] by a mental and holistic conceptual framework used to map how the variables, issues and processes are influencing each other in the complex competitions and interactions among and between insect species and the impacts. Although these archetypes are qualitative in nature, they help to disclose and elucidate the fundamental feedback configurations that occur in maize fields when insect pests are competing for resource and associated parasitoids are hunting for hosts. The CLD obtained were converted into a dynamic modelling using stocks, flows, auxiliary links and clouds; which in turn were translated into coupled differential equations for simulations.</p>
