<p id="Par18">The comparison of sole pest species systems with multi-pest species systems of the models showed that the population of each species declined in multi-pest species systems and more the number of pest species involved in the system increased more the population of each species declined. In contrary, the total number of pest populations in the systems increased with the number of pest species involved in the system. Therefore, the reduction of stemborer populations in maize fields with the arrival of 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> was even overtaken up by that latter. Those results indicate the overall pest abundance increasing in maize fields with the invasion of fall armyworm in maize stemborer systems with more infestations and damages, leading to the increasing of the smallholder incomes losses in maize production. However, the fact that no competition between parasitoid species was considered might have effect on the system dynamics model.
