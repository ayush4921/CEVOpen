<p id="Par15">Within stemborer species in multi-species systems (either in two or three species systems), 
 <italic>C. partellus</italic> exhibited dominance whenever involved in a system. Several previous studies have reported the dominance of 
 <italic>C. partellus</italic> over 
 <italic>B. fusca</italic> and 
 <italic>S. calamistis</italic> when they co-exist

 <italic>C. partellus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. fuca</italic>, the model showed that 
 <italic>C. partellus</italic> has displaced 
 <italic>B. fusca</italic> population with time. Those competitive interactions may justify the spatial distribution of these stemborer species in Kenya. Previous studies have reported that 
 <italic>B. fusca</italic> and 
 <italic>S. calamistis</italic> co-exist in the highlands with dominance of 
 <italic>B. fusca</italic> species, while 
 <italic>C. partellus</italic> and
