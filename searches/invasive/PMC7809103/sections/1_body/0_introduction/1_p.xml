 </sup>. The productivity of maize is affected by a wide array of biotic and abiotic stresses that reduce the quantity and quality of its yields. Insect pest pressure is among the major threats that constrain maize crop from reaching its maximum potential yields. A complex of lepidopteran stemborers and the recent invasive fall armyworm 
 <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> (J.E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) are the primary pests of maize crop in many parts of the world, including Kenya, causing yield losses ranged from 30 to 70%
