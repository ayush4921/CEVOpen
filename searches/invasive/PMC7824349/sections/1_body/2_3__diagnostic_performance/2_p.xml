<p>The diagnostic performance of BDG assays has been assessed in approximately 200 publications, including multiple meta-analyses [
 <xref rid="B7-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Although the heterogeneity of many studies is relatively high, diagnostic performance characteristics are reasonably reproducible. Typically, BDG negative predictive value is very high, often greater than 95%, while positive predictive value is lower, due to observations of BDG titers above the positive threshold, which are deemed to be diagnostic false positives [
 <xref rid="B42-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Analytically, the BDG reagents are being activated by the actual presence of BDG in the serum samples. Accordingly, these findings beg the question of the source or sources of the BDG. At this point, three decades of clinical BDG testing experience as well as pre-clinical research suggest that three main sources of circulating BDG exist. These include IFD, iatrogenic contamination, and intestinal translocation. Non-specific pulmonary translocation due to fungal colonization is also a potential source, given the high levels of serum BDG observed to translocate from the alveoli in pneumocystosis [
 <xref rid="B43-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], but non-IFD pulmonary translocation studies have not been performed and represent an area where data are needed [
