<p>BDG can be contributed to the circulation during cell wall remodeling in the life cycle of fungal cells [
 <xref rid="B39-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The extent to which this occurs is dependent upon myriad factors including fungal genus and species, site of infection, access to the vasculature, host factors including immune response, and clearance efficacy. Assay reactivity is dependent upon structural factors such as BDG molecular weight, branching, and single versus triple helical structure [
 <xref rid="B40-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. While commercial BDG assays are considered qualitative assays, due to the multiple factors that can contribute to titer, they have continuous numerical outputs which have permitted the validation of clinical thresholds for negative, indeterminate, and positive association with invasive fungal disease. In this context, the results of BDG testing are usually evaluated using the principles appropriate to quantitative assays [
