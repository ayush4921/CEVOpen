<p>Commercialization of BDG diagnostics has primarily involved reagent preparations from the blood cells of two genera of Horseshoe Crabs, 
 <italic>Limulus polyphemus</italic> and 
 <italic>Tachypleus tridentatus</italic> [

The former is found only on the east coast of North America while the latter is found off the coast of China and in coastal waters to its south. These preparations of BDG detection reagents utilize a protein zymogen extract from Horseshoe Crab granulocytes commonly referred to as 
 <italic>Limulus</italic> amebocyte lysate or LAL [
