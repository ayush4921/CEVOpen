<p>Inactivation, or elimination, of the endotoxin-specific components of the cascade renders it exclusively sensitive to BDG, permitting the creation of a reagent suitable for laboratory assays for BDG [

The linear range of glucan concentrations accessible to LAL-based reagent BDG detection is dependent upon the formulation used and normally extends over a serum range that includes a negative, indeterminate, and positive range, with respect to invasive fungal disease [
