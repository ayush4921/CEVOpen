<p>As described above, circulating BDG titer is an important adjunct in the diagnostic process for patients suspected of invasive fungal infections. While the NPV is very high, optimizing the utility of positive BDG results requires consideration of both host and clinical factors, as well as potential sources of iatrogenic contamination. The latter factors may include introduction of BDG-contaminated materials in the course of medical care. In that circumstance, institutional observations suggesting an association between elevated BDG and certain parenterals or devices should prompt evaluation of BDG burdens present in those products. Prospective BDG testing practices should employ blood draws taken prior to introduction of materials considered suspect. Similarly, blood draws obtained during the initial 3 days post-surgery involving intra-cavity use of gauze and surgical sponges need to be interpreted cautiously and the observation of very rapidly declining serial sample values may indicate contamination rather than infection. In addition, BDG testing results of samples taken after intra-operative autologous blood recovery using surgical sponges must be similarly considered. In patients with intestinal permeability barrier injury risk factors, the presence of elevated BDG absent a diagnosis of IFD and iatrogenic contamination should prompt consideration of potential luminal contents translocation. This is also of significant importance given the association of intestinal permeability barrier injury and the potential for infection due to translocation of viable microorganisms, including
