 <xref rid="B21-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It is not produced in mammals, nor are mammals capable of its enzymatic degradation [
 <xref rid="B22-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Degradation of BDG has been observed in phagocytic cells and is presumed to occur chemically, through hydrolytic mechanisms [
 <xref rid="B23-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Some of the myriad functions of BDG include use as a cell wall structural material in fungi [
 <xref rid="B24-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], as extra-cellular and intra-cellular matrix material in certain bacteria [
 <xref rid="B25-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and algae [
 <xref rid="B26-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], respectively. In plants, it appears as a wound repair and specialized structural material [
 <xref rid="B27-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], typically in wound response tissue [
 <xref rid="B28-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], vascular elements [
 <xref rid="B29-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and as intracellular pressure regulators in plasmodesmata [
 <xref rid="B30-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In mammals and insects, which do not make BDG, it is recognized as an innate immune system-activating pathogen-associated molecular pattern and influences innate immuno-metabolism [
 <xref rid="B31-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. BDG is comprised of sequential 
 <sc>d</sc>-glucose molecules linked by (1→3)-β-glycosidic linkages. The primary backbone structure of BDG is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jof-07-00014-f003">Figure 3</xref>, with a fungi-typical (1→6)-β-linked glucose branch. The β linkage imposes steric constraints upon the orientation of the adjacent glucose molecules leading to the formation of a helical structure as the polyglucan chain becomes elongated [
 <xref rid="B34-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Side chain addition, or branching, in multiple forms and with multiple moieties is also observed to occur, creating characteristic BDG types among different taxonomic groups [
 <xref rid="B37-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Single helical BDG is observed to anneal through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, resulting in native triple helical structures. Assemblages of triple helical structures also form, leading to ordered cable-like materials that contribute mechanical strength and structure to fungal cell walls [
