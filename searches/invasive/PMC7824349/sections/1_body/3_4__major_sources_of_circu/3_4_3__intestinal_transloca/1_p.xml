<p>The past two decades have seen an explosion in data regarding intestinal barrier permeability, its myriad causes, and its relationship to inflammation-related pathophysiology [

 <xref rid="B75-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Multiple biomarkers such as zonulin and various claudins have been identified as useful markers in characterizing the nature of barrier injury [

 <xref rid="B77-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Data regarding elevated circulating BDG, its correlation with other markers of microbial translocation and inflammation, and orthogonal testing with enteral polysaccharides such as fluorescein labeled dextran demonstrate that it is also a translocated entity [

 <xref rid="B80-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Ellis et al. 2008 observed that in a series of non-IFD hematological malignancy patients undergoing chemotherapy, those with enterocyte damage and/or mucositis had BDG titers that were persistently elevated compared to patients without those pathologies (

The kinds of insults that contribute to intestinal barrier permeability include intestinal ischemia, mesenteric hypoxia, microbial toxins, viral infection of intestinal tissue, metabolic toxicity such as in uremia, chemotherapy-associated mucositis, large total surface area burns, and protease-producing intestinal enterococci (
 <xref rid="jof-07-00014-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). All of these conditions have been observed to be associated with elevated BDG titers. Thus, it is important to fully understand the host and clinical factors that could be contributing to intestinal barrier permeability as part of the consideration of BDG titer interpretation.
