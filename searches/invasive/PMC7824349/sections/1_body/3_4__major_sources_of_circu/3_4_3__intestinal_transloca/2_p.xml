<p>Several conditions may contribute to intestinal hypoxia, which is a causative factor in intestinal permeability barrier injury. These include large surface area burns, intestinal ischemia reperfusion injury, mesenteric hypoxia, and intra-dialytic hypotension. Studies have described the relationship between large surface area burns and BDG false positives [

Similarly, a Japanese study evaluated the use of BDG testing in the diagnosis of candidemia in severe burn patients and demonstrated high sensitivity, 100%, but lower specificity, 68%, when the test manufacturerâ€™s positive cutoff of 11 pg/mL was used. A cutoff of 40 pg/mL generated a sensitivity of 100% with a specificity of 95% [
