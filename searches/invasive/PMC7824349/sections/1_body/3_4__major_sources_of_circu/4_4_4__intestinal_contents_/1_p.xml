<p>Translocation of BDG from the intestinal lumen through the intestinal epithelium and then to the wider circulation raises questions concerning the sources of luminal BDG. Research over the last few decades suggests that both ingested foodstuffs and the intestinal mycobiome are potential contributors. With respect to the former, certain foods are extremely rich in BDG. Oat bran BDG content is in the range of 4.5%, by weight [

At this point, the case for translocating foodstuff-derived BDG remains to be more fully evaluated. A recent study evaluated a single bolus of extremely high BDG content foodstuff consumption in an HIV population and serial testing over 24 h failed to reveal meaningful serum BDG titer elevation [

The intestinal mycobiome represents another potential source of translocatable BDG and there are structural differences between fungal and plant-origin BDG which may affect translocation. This is of particular interest in patients receiving gut-active broad spectrum antibacterials. The administration of such drugs has been demonstrated to produce 1–2.5 log increases in gut 
 <italic>Candida</italic> populations in patients [

It is possible that the release of mycobiome-origin BDG in the gut lumen, proximal to the luminal epithelium, may result in more efficient translocation. These are areas of continuing investigation with the potential to illuminate prognosis of gut-originating candidiasis and inflammatory disease. In this light, recently published data by Zhai et al. 2020 revealed an expansion of pathogenic 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species in the intestinal mycobiota of post-stem cell transplant patients two–ten days prior to their developing candidemia. DNA analysis showed that the candidemia strains clustered tightly with the luminal contents strains [

 <italic>Candida</italic> overgrowth and BDG translocation with resulting hepatic inflammation, thought to occur through BDG ligation of hepatic Kuppfer cell dectin-1. Dectin-1 knock-out mice failed to develop the inflammation, leading to the conclusion that translocated intestinal origin BDG played a major role [
