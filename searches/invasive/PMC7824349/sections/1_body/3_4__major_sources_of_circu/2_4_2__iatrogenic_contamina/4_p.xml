<p>Another category of iatrogenic patient contamination, one that has had significant debate, is that of parenteral administration of potentially contaminated antibiotics. Multiple publications asserting the occurrence of patient false positives by this route as well as the opposite have been presented [

 <xref rid="B69-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. While this route of patient contamination is possible, the high level of dilution generated upon injection of relatively low volumes of antibiotic make this unlikely. Further, the high negative predictive value for IFD observed for patients receiving a vast array of antibiotics suggests that this is not a significant problem [
