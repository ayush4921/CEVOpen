<p>Medical treatment-related BDG contamination has been assessed in a variety of clinical contexts including multiple types of intravenously administered materials including drugs and blood fractionation products, invasive use of surgical materials, and cellulosic dialysis membranes 
 <xref rid="jof-07-00014-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. In the case of drug formulations, BDG may be present in the original source material itself, such as products made by fungal fermentation [
 <xref rid="B53-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], in excipients added to the formulation [
 <xref rid="B54-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], from media used in microbial or cell culture [
 <xref rid="B55-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], or from process equipment, materials, and solutions [
 <xref rid="B56-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In the case of blood fractionation products such as IVIg and serum albumin, the filtration of blood plasma through cellulosic depth filters can result in leached plant BDG (callose) [

 <xref rid="B58-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. It is fairly common to observe highly elevated BDG titers in patients receiving albumin or immunoglobulin (IVIg) infusions [
 <xref rid="B59-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. These high titers are usually observed to decline relatively quickly and such responses support suspicion of iatrogenic contamination.

The very rapid rise and fall of serum BDG subsequent to its infusion is characteristic of such contamination events.
