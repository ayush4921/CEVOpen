<p>Surgical materials such as sponges and gauze permit large quantities of BDG (up to millions of pg/gm of gauze or sponge material) to be leached during intra-cavity or other invasive use, as well as contact with surgical solutions and bodily fluids such as with certain autologous blood recovery procedures [

Injected particulate BDG has been shown to generate elevated circulatory BDG for years after administration, making detailed medical history analysis critical to interpretation of unexpectedly high BDG titers in patients in whom IFD is unsuspected [
