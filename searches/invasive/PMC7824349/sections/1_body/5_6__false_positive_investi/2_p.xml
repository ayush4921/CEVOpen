<p>In addition to investigation of the above-listed potential sources of circulating BDG, support for the likely presence of a fungal source of the observed BDG may be found by utilizing additional tests. These include microscopic examination of appropriate patient tissue and fluid samples, as well as various PCR and antigen tests, as well as emerging novel diagnostic technologies [

Multiple studies have reported improved specificity in the setting of multiple fungal marker utilization. Boch et al. 2016 reported the increase in specificity, in the setting of invasive aspergillosis, from 48% to 94% when serum BDG results were combined with BAL galactomannan results [

 <xref rid="B123-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. In combination, the specificity was 98%. Similarly, Urabe et al. 2017 demonstrated that combining 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> PCR with BDG raised specificity from 48.2% in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, to 96.7% and 99.2% with two different PCR assays, respectively [
