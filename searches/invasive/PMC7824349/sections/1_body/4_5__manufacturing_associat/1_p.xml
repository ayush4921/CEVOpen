<p>Production processes for parenterals are another potential source of patient-contaminating BDG. During manufacturing, the introduction of BDG to parenterals may occur through multiple sources. These include fermentation media components such as yeast extracts, plant material extracts, sugars, as well as the use of fungal organisms as the source of fermentation products [

 <xref rid="B57-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. If downstream processing does not remove the contaminating BDG, it may result in patient exposure. Examples of patient contamination after infusions have been reported in the literature and represent a failure to control an easily measurable contaminant [

 <xref rid="B57-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. These devices are generally mixtures of cellulose and diatomaceous earth and are used to provide initial clarification of cell culture fluid, microbial fermentation broths, and blood plasma. As plant material contains small quantities of BDG (callose) in various plant tissues [
 <xref rid="B117-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>], BDG is readily leached from the depth filters to enter downstream processing as a contaminant [

 <xref rid="B118-jof-07-00014" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>], Blood fractionation products, whose starting material is depth filtered blood plasma, are recognized sources of product contamination with BDG [
