<p>Further consideration of the possible evolutionary trajectories of plant invasions may inform how researchers determine the risk, impact, and management of invasive plant species. Evidence suggests that the enhancement of traits via evolution may be constrained by negative correlations between phenotypic traits that are subject to selection, for example in 
 <italic>Melaleuca quinquenervia</italic>, in which of three leaf terpenoids under selection, cineole and viridiflorol are reduced in correlation with an increase in the terpenoid nerolidol in invasive range plants, despite predictions based on selection skewers analysis of increases in cineole and viridiflorol over time (Franks et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">2012</xref>). If geographic variation in selection strength (Thompson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">1997</xref>) combined with tradeoffs between traits under selection is common across invasive species, we may be seriously limited in our ability to predict the evolutionary potential of different species, which Whitney &amp; Gabler (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">2008</xref>) identified as crucial to improving the invasive species predictive schemes (ISPS) developed to identify and exclude potential invaders in different regions. In some evolutionary scenarios, the destructive impact of invasive species upon native species may diminish over time, as has been documented for a chronosequence of the invasion of 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> (Lankau et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">2009</xref>), or a comparison between the impact of home- and introduced-range 
 <italic>Centaurea maculosa</italic> on native grass species (Callaway et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">2005</xref>). Studies that attempt to address the evolution of invasiveness should be careful to identify heritable traits associated with plant success and invasive impacts, to elucidate the mechanisms of selection that operate upon invasives, and to place selection firmly within the context of other evolutionary forces. The extent to which these goals are pursued will determine the extent to which our understanding of the evolution of invasive plant species informs management and prevention of the ecological impact of invasive plant species.
