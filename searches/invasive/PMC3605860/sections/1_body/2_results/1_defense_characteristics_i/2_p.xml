<p>Although there were no significant differences overall by plant range for herbivore performance or plant damage inflicted by herbivores, further classification of herbivores revealed significant variation in effect sizes for these metrics. Herbivore family did not explain variation in herbivore performance (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.86) or plant damage by herbivores (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.76), but classifying herbivores by degree of feeding specialization or geographic range explains some of the heterogeneity in effect sizes. Classifying herbivores by feeding habits—generalist, specialist, or unclassified communities of herbivores—predicted 67% of the variation in effect size of herbivore performance, although these categories were not statistically significant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.048). There were trends toward a decline in performance of generalists and a rise in performance of specialists when both were placed on introduced plants, indicating that introduced plants tended toward higher defenses against generalists and lower defenses against specialists than home-range plants. However, the degree of herbivore specialization did not significantly explain variation in defenses as inferred from the amount of herbivore damage sustained by plants (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.64). Herbivores were also categorized by geographic range; herbivores collected from the plant species' home range were more negatively impacted by feeding on home-range plants, while herbivores present in both ranges due to universal distribution or human introduction as biocontrol agents were equally impacted by defenses from home- versus introduced-range plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). Herbivore geographic range also explained variation in plant damage by herbivores: home-range plants suffered less damage from herbivores restricted to the home range, indicating higher defenses in the home range against accustomed predators, while introduced-range plants suffered less herbivore damage from herbivores currently found in both ranges, indicating greater defenses in introduced-range plants against universally distributed and human-introduced herbivores (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). Plant species did not significantly predict variation in effect sizes in difference by range for herbivore performance (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.098) or herbivore-induced damage to plants (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.067).
