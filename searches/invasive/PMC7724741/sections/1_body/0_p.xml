<p>The small hive beetle, 
 <italic>Aethina tumida</italic> Murray, is an invasive pest of social bee colonies (

 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Neumann et al. 2016</xref>), which has spread from its native range in Sub-Saharan Africa to all continents except Antarctica (

 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Spiewok and Neumann 2006</xref>). Occasionally, reproduction occurs as a mass event, whereby the small hive beetle larvae devour honey bee nest components (bee brood, bee bread, honey, and dead adult bees), often leading to total colony collapse (
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Ellis 2012</xref>). Once reaching the postfeeding stage, small hive beetle larvae migrate out of a hive and burrow into neighboring soil where they pupate in chambers they excavate (
