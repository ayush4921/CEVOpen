<p>Within 5 d after introduction to the substrates, 44 larvae (range: 5â€“13) drowned in the excess water accumulated at the bottom of the perlite containers. Similarly, four larvae had drowned in one of the containers of stone wool. The GLM analysis for the emergence of small hive beetles showed significant differences among substrates (df = 4, LRT = 27.267, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). The pairwise comparison showed that emergence rates of small hive beetles were similar for all substrates, except for the perlite substrate (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The emergence rates in stone wool, coconut fiber, and the mixture were not different from that in the control substrate (sand, 
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). Typical small hive beetle pupation chambers could be observed through the container wall in all substrates, except perlite. Here, the remaining larvae did not pupate and eventually died. Significant differences were observed in the development time of small hive beetles pupating in the various substrates (
 <italic>F</italic> = 6.355, df = 3, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, see 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Development time in coconut fiber and stone wool substrates were significantly shorter than in the control substrate (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), but similar to the coconut fiber/perlite mixture. The latter was not different from the control substrate (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). The first adult small hive beetles emerged from the coconut fiber substrate after 23 d. The last adults to emerge were observed in the sand, 37 d after the larvae were exposed to the substrate.
