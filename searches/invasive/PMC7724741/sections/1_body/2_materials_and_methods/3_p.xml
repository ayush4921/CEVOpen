<p>Twenty-five small hive beetle wandering larvae were added to each pupation container, totaling 100 larvae per substrate distributed over four replicate containers per each of the five treatments. Thereafter, the containers were placed in an incubator at 25Â°C and total darkness for the duration of pupation. The containers were checked daily, for 37 d, for dead larvae and emerged adults until 9 October 2016, on which day all containers were checked for remaining live adult small hive beetles by filtering the soil.</p>
