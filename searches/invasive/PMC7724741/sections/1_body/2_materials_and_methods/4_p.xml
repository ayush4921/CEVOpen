<p>A generalized linear model (GLM) with a betabinomial distribution was used to compare emergence rates aggregated for containers with substrate as the fixed factor. We then performed pairwise comparisons between emergence rates of the substrates tested. Small hive beetle larvae that drowned within the first 5 d after exposure to the substrates were omitted from the analysis. All hypothesis tests were likelihood ratio tests (LRT). Similarly, development time (day adult emerged 
 <italic>minus</italic> day larvae added to substrate) was compared between the different substrates with a univariate GLM with containers as a random factor. Pairwise comparisons between substrates were performed and estimated means generated from the models.
