<p>Three greenhouse substrates were selected for this investigation (purchased in dry form, at Gator Hydroponics, Gainesville, FL): one organic (coir or coconut fiber—Cocogro) and two inorganic substrates (stone wool and perlite), all of which are commonly used in soilless plant cultures (

The substrates were put into transparent plastic pupation containers (1.6 liter), with a minimum depth of 10 cm of substrate available for small hive beetle pupation. A total volume of 1,100–1,200 ml of substrate was used. The moisture levels of the different substrates varied due to the differences in the water holding capacity of the substrates (
