<p>Adult small hive beetles (
 <italic>n</italic> = 44) were manually collected 11 August 2016 from naturally infested local honey bee colonies managed according to standard practices for the region at the University of Florida, Honey Bee Research and Extension Laboratory, Bee Biology Unit (Gainesville, FL, 29°37′37.1″N 82°21′22.6″W). The adult small hive beetles were divided into two groups and placed into separate cubic plastic boxes (approximately 2 liter per box), each containing 400 g of standard small hive beetle food mixture (

The boxes were checked twice weekly, at which time moist tissue paper and additional food were added ad libitum. The tissue paper was moistened to near saturation with tap water and was used to raise the humidity in the breeding boxes to facilitate larval hatching (
