<p>In a broader context, our data suggest an increased ability and likelihood for small hive beetles to complete their life cycles in greenhouses, thereby constituting potential hot spots for this beetle in regions, which would otherwise be marginal or unsuitable for establishment of this invasive species (
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Cornelissen et al. 2019</xref>). In conclusion, we demonstrated that the small hive beetle can pupate in a variety of substrates, which is consistent with the opportunistic nature of this invasive species (
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Gonthier et al. 2019</xref>).
