<p>Our data clearly show that small hive beetles can pupate in substrates used in greenhouse settings. In fact, small hive beetles pupated equally well in coconut fiber, coconut fiber + perlite, stone wool, and sand (the control substrate) with the emergence rates varying between 68.1 and 87.6%. The development time for rockwool and coconut fiber was shorter than the control substrate. Several studies obtained comparable results in various substrate types at similar temperatures (
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Cornelissen et al. 2019</xref>; Supp Table 1 [online only]), thereby indicating that all of the tested substrates, except perlite, are suitable for completion of the small hive beetle life cycle. In comparison with the other substrates, perlite (an amorphous volcanic glass) has an extremely low density and does not form a consistent mass. The perlite substrates were composed of separate lumps of up to 1 cm in size, which probably could not support certain physical aspects required by small hive beetles for pupation. For instance, wandering larvae were unable to make pupation chambers (
