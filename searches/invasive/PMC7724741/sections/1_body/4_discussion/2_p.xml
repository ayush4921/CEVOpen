<p>Our data further suggest that small hive beetles could cause problems to bees used to pollinate horticultural crops grown in greenhouses. However, no such large-scale problems have been reported in bumble bee pollinated greenhouse crops in the United States because the small hive beetle became established in 1996. At the same time, no information exists on the potential risks for other bee species, such as 
 <italic>Bombus terrestris</italic> Linnaeus (Hymenoptera: Apidae), used for crop pollination outside of the United States. Furthermore, the risk for honey bee pollination units could be higher, as small hive beetles could already be residing in a colony before they enter a greenhouse. Although the use of honey bees for greenhouse pollination in the United States might be minimal, they are used at a larger scale in other countries. For instance, approximately 5,000 honey bee colonies are used annually for greenhouse and seed pollination in the Netherlands (
