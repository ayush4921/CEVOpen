<p>Honey bees, stingless bees, bumble bees, and solitary bees are all used as pollinators for greenhouse crops. These crops include aubergine, strawberry, courgette, tomato, and bell pepper (
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Guerra-Sanz 2008</xref>), among others. With optimal growing conditions maintained for up to 11 mo a year and the presence of host species for many months, greenhouses could serve as hotspots for small hive beetles, especially in areas where they would otherwise meet environmental constraints limiting their reproduction and survival (
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Cornelissen et al. 2019</xref>). The small hive beetleâ€™s potential use of greenhouses could be limited if the beetle is unable to complete its lifecycle within the structure. Many greenhouse crop systems include substrates other than soil in which plants are grown. Even though small hive beetles can pupate in a variety of soil types, as long as the soils are sufficiently moist (
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Ellis et al. 2002</xref>), their ability to pupate successfully in these greenhouse substrates is currently unknown. Here, we investigated if substrates commonly used in greenhouses are suitable pupation media for small hive beetles. We hypothesized that small hive beetle larvae would be able to pupate in these substrates, making greenhouses potentially suitable sites for small hive beetle reproduction and survival.
