    "Pests and diseases introduced from other countries are known to pose a threat to trees, woods and forests in many locations throughout the world. Once introduced they can be spread inadvertently by countryside visitors hiking, biking or riding along paths and trails through wooded areas. Engaging and communicating with these groups of countryside users to encourage and facilitate positive biosecurity behaviours is crucial for the future resilience of trees, woods and forests. This review draws on literature outlining principles for stakeholder engagement in forestry as well as evaluations of biosecurity campaigns from around the world. Key points are briefly presented for communicators aiming to encourage better biosecurity in the countryside. These include, the need to design campaigns based on the values and motivations of recreationists, using trusted information sources and understanding the importance of combining information with facilities so as to reduce the cost (in terms of effort and inconvenience) to hikers and other countryside users."
