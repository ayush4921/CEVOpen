     <italic>Individual values and motivations</italic>
     <break/>Understand the interests, motivations, values and perceptions of those 
     <break/> to be engaged.
     <break/>Design engagement programme and communication materials 
     <break/> around those motivations, values and perceptions.
    </td>
    <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Messaging should reflect the diverse contexts and interests of the 
     <break/> target audience.
     <break/>Tailor messages for each stakeholder group based on their needs 
     <break/> and interests so they can understand, ‘what's in it for me?’.
     <break/>Understand motivations and values and the things people care about.
     <break/>Understand peoples’ risk perceptions.
     <break/>Recognise the importance of peoples’ environmental worldview and 
     <break/> views of human nature relationships.

    <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
     <italic>Social and physical context</italic>
     <break/>Understand the social and physical contexts of those to be engaged.
     <break/>Design engagement programme, communication materials, and 
     <break/> necessary infrastructure around those contexts.
    </td>
    <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Relate to the wider social and physical context of target groups.
     <break/>Social context plays a role in shaping, modifying or driving the individual 
     <break/> factors above.
     <break/>Physical context plays a role in behaviour, by prompting or inhibiting 
     <break/> certain types of action. For example, how easy is it for hikers to clean 
     <break/> their boots in different situations, such as at carparks or hostels, before 
     <break/> or after a walk?
    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
     <italic>Communication channels used</italic>
     <break/>Understand where and how the target group currently access 
     <break/> information relating to related topics such as environmental issues, 
     <break/> trees, plants and biodiversity.
     <break/>Design engagement programme around that understanding and utilise 
     <break/> multiple communication channels if required.
    </td>
    <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Adopt a multifaceted approach to communication.
     <break/>Effective public engagement will likely involve multiple methods and will 
     <break/> require collaboration and coordination across multiple partners.
     <break/>Identify engagement activities and communication tools that will resonate 
     <break/> with the stakeholder group.
     <break/>Communication should be a two-way process of mutual learning between 
     <break/> ‘communicators’ and ‘audience’.

    <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
     <italic>Trusted communicators</italic>
     <break/>Understand which organisations and information sources the target 
     <break/> audience trust, rely on and utilise when seeking information on 
     <break/> related topics.
     <break/>Investigate feasibility of using these trusted intermediaries in 
     <break/> communication and engagement.
    </td>
    <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sources providing information and advice need to be trusted by those 
     <break/> receiving the information.
     <break/>Channel information through the most appropriate person or organisation 
     <break/> that has the respect and trust of the stakeholder group. This might 
     <break/> require intermediaries to be involved so these need to be identified.
     <break/>Recognise that more information does not automatically lead to changed 
     <break/> behaviours.
    </td>

    <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
     <italic>Consistent messaging</italic>
     <break/>Ensure that the engagement programme uses consistent and 
     <break/> persistent messaging.
    </td>
    <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Those seeking to engage the public need messages that are consistent.
     <break/>Engagement processes must have legitimacy with the intended 
     <break/> stakeholders.

    <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
     <italic>Communicate the purpose of actions</italic>
     <break/>Be clear about the positive impacts that the required actions will have.
    </td>
    <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">The aim here should be to explain what people need to do and how to 
     <break/> do it.
     <break/>Such explanation should be provided in such a way that it is reasonable 
     <break/> to expect people will believe they have the ability to do it.
     <break/>Action should be facilitated if people can see that what they are being 
     <break/> asked to do will have a positive impact.
     <break/>People need a sense of personal responsibility, or a feeling of personal 
     <break/> obligation to take action.
