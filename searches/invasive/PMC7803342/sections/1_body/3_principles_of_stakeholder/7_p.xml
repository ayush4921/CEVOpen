<p>A review of literature relating to engaging people in biodiversity issues identified a number of factors which could explain different levels of engagement, and that could therefore be relevant when designing engagement programmes for biosecurity issues [

 <xref rid="ETLS-4-531TB2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. These include the need to make clear what people need to do, and how. These ‘action’ messages should be provided in such a way that it is reasonable to expect people will believe they have the ability to carry out the required actions. For example, messages need to be clear and straightforward. It is also important to explain how the actions required will have a positive impact, such that people may feel a sense of personal responsibility, or personal obligation to take action.
