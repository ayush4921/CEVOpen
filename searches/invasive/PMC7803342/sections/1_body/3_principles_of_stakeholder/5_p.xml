<p>Key principles have been developed that could be used to guide forestry interventions aimed at achieving behavioural change [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-531C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These principles were developed for diverse forestry behaviours ranging from activities such as felling and timber harvesting to social, recreational and cultural activities conducted in a woodland or forest setting. They could also include biosecurity behaviours. The study considered interventions in other sectors including health, energy and transport that focused on behaviour and behaviour change, to look for transferable lessons for the forestry sector. These included the need to relate to the wider social and physical context of target groups as social context plays a role in shaping, modifying or driving the individual factors described above. It also recognised that physical context plays a role in behaviour, by prompting or inhibiting certain types of action. For example, countryside managers should consider how easy it is for hikers to clean their boots in different situations, such as at carparks, hostels or train stations before setting off on a walk or before heading home. Of relevance to this point, a study carried out in Scotland, U.K., in 2018 found that key local businesses and tourist organisations expressed a willingness to provide the necessary biosecurity equipment for hikers, such as brushes, boot scrapers and taps [
