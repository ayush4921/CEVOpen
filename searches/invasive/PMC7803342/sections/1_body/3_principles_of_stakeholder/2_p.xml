<p>In 2011, guidelines were produced for public engagement in the management of woodlands in the U.K. [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-531C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The guidelines included some key issues to be addressed before a campaign can be initiated. These include the need to establish the reasons for engaging with people (for example, awareness raising, information provision or behavioural change), and to identify those who have a stake in the programme or those who are the target of it. Communicators should then consider how best to engage each stakeholder or stakeholder group, and identify issues and potential conflicts that might affect engagement. While these guidelines were written within the context of U.K. forest and woodland planning they are widely relevant for other contexts in other countries.
