<p>To explore these issues the project team reviewed existing literature relating to the following topics: 
 <list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
   <p>The role of recreationists in the introduction and spread of pests, pathogens, seeds, weeds and other non-native invasive species.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Principles of stakeholder communication and engagement for behavioural change.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Effectiveness of behavioural change interventions relating to biosecurity.</p>
  </list-item>
 </list>The literature review focussed on both terrestrial and aquatic environments. The review also extended beyond pests and diseases to include the spread of seeds, weeds and non-native invasive species, due to the paucity of the available evidence relating specifically to recreationists and tree health. Significant evidence and insights may be learnt from the literature on the role of recreationists in the spread of seeds, weeds and non-native species, particularly in the context of their activities, actions, required behaviours, impacts and approaches to messaging and engagement.
