<p>While recognising that there are multiple ways in which recreationists and visitors to countryside areas can contribute to improving biosecurity, the aim of this review is to focus on their role in introducing and spreading pests and pathogens through their recreational activities, and how to help prevent or reduce this through engagement programmes. A key aim is therefore to highlight whether existing behavioural change interventions for biosecurity have achieved the desired changes, and what lessons can be learnt.</p>
