<p>It is well established that many damaging tree pests and diseases have been accidentally introduced to Great Britain (GB) and elsewhere, such as on plant material and wood packaging imported from other countries [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-531C1" ref-type="bibr">1â€“3</xref>] and through increased global travel [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-531C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In their native habitats and ecosystems, these invertebrates and pathogens may cause few problems, as they have a natural niche in their established environments and are in balance with other species around them. However, in new environments some of these imported organisms can be fast-spreading and damaging to native and established species and habitats, causing, for example, declines in biodiversity [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-531C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], as there are none of the same environmental or biological controls which are found in their native environments elsewhere in the world. For example, populations of the oak processionary moth are controlled by natural predators in countries in southern Europe where the moths are not considered to be a threat, but these predators are not present in northern European countries where the moth is known to defoliate large numbers of oak trees [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-531C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Recent examples of tree diseases introduced into GB include Dothistroma Needle Blight, Ash Dieback and 
 <italic>Phytophthora ramorum</italic> (
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic>) [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-531C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The latter is a threat to the economically important larch tree (
 <italic>Larix</italic> species) and other species associated with woodlands in GB and has caused widespread damage to forests in the west of the country. It was first detected in GB in 2002 on a viburnum plant at a garden centre in Sussex [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-531C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. 
 <italic>P. ramorum</italic> is an algae-like organism called a water mould and produces extremely high levels of infective spores which can be spread over several miles in mists, air currents, watercourses and rain splash. Where the spores fall to the ground they can be further dispersed in mud and soil on footwear, tyres and animals [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-531C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Hence recreationists can spread the pathogen as they move through the countryside. This is one example that highlights why it is important to understand how best to support hikers and other recreationists to reduce their potential impact and engage in positive biosecurity behaviours through targeted engagement programmes and communication.
