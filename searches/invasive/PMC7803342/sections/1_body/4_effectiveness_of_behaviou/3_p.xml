<p>Two examples of campaigns that achieved some success in terms of behavioural change of recreationists both combine the provision of information with practical resources and biosecurity equipment. Campaigns aimed at U.S.A. campers regarding the movement of firewood seem to have had some success at reducing the numbers of campers transporting firewood from places outside of campsites through understanding their motivations and behaviours [

 <xref rid="ETLS-4-531C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This program also made it easier for campers to purchase firewood on-site on their arrival, thus reducing the cost (in terms of effort) to recreationists. The ‘Check, Clean, Dry’ campaign in New Zealand [

Again, the success of this programme lies in the fact that it combined information provision to raise awareness with the provision of practical resources such as cleaning stations, detergent sachets and spray bottles for recreationists.
