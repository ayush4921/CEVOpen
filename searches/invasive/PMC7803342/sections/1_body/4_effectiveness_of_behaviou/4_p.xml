<p>Overall, looking at evaluations of biosecurity engagement campaigns tells two stories. On the one hand, a number of campaigns in different countries in both terrestrial and aquatic environments have not succeeded in raising awareness and changing self-reported behaviours, even when people have been exposed to information. On the other hand, U.S.A. campaigns aimed at campers to stop the movement of firewood report some positive achievements, and the ‘Check, Clean, Dry’ campaign in New Zealand appears to have increased awareness and engagement with positive biosecurity actions by water-based recreationists. A number of conclusions from the ‘Check, Clean, Dry’ evaluations about its strengths and reasons for success, are described here as they have relevance for all biosecurity engagement campaigns, including those for woods and forests. The campaign used multiple different communications channels with a focus on signs at key recreational sites, and cleaning stations were also provided at high-risk sites. Biosecurity messaging about actions to take were simple and consistent across sites. Evaluation of engagement programmes was key to understanding what worked and what did not work.</p>
