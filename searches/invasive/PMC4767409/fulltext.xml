Removal of invasive plant species to conserve native diversity is a common management objective in many ecosystems, including wetlands. However, substantial changes in plant community composition have the potential to alter sediment characteristics and ecosystem services, including permanent removal of nitrogen from these systems via microbial denitrification. A balanced assessment of costs associated with keeping and removing invasive plants is needed to manage simultaneously for biodiversity and pollution targets. We monitored small-scale removals of <italic>Phragmites australis</italic> over four years to determine their effects on potential denitrification rates relative to three untreated <italic>Phragmites</italic> sites and adjacent sites dominated by native <italic>Typha angustifolia</italic>. Sediment ammonium increased following the removal of vegetation from treated sites, likely as a result of decreases in both plant uptake and nitrification. Denitrification potentials were lower in removal sites relative to untreated <italic>Phragmites</italic> sites, a pattern that persisted at least two years following removal as native plant species began to re-colonize treated sites. These results suggest the potential for a trade-off between invasive-plant management and nitrogen-removal services. A balanced assessment of costs associated with keeping versus removing invasive plants is needed to adequately manage simultaneously for biodiversity and pollution targets.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the ENY Chapter of the Nature Conservancy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nature.org">www.nature.org</ext-link>), a Tibor T.

By causing local extinctions, invasives are thought to reduce biodiversity [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], which is often correlated to ecosystem functions [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As many ecosystem functions provide essential services for human survival and well-being, these relationships imply that preservation of biodiversity is important for environmental management [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], particularly when ecosystems provide multiple ecosystem services [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Consequently, eradicating invasive species has become a common management practice. That said, invasive species are often better than native species at sequestering limiting resources into biomass [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Conflicts between management goals can occur if, after invasion, this difference in ability results in improved nutrient storage or removal at the same time other services are degraded [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Quantifying the effect of invaders on nutrient storage and removal processes is necessary to assess the full ecological effect of invasions, and to prioritize the allocation of limited management resources. This tradeoff may be especially important in wetlands. These ecosystems provide a diverse array of ecosystem services, including flood abatement, support for biodiversity, and improvement of water quality. Together these services have been valued at approximately $3000 per hectare annually [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. At least 50% of the global wetland area has been lost to agricultural, urban, and rural development and much of the remaining wetlands are considered &#x0201c;degraded.&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Wetlands have been found to be particularly susceptible to invasions by opportunistic plant invaders that form monotypic stands and displace native plant species. In fact, over 24% of the "worst plant invaders" are wetland plants [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. One of the best known of these wetland plant invaders is <italic>Phragmites australis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although <italic>Phragmites</italic> has been at least a minor component of brackish marshes in the United States for over 40,000 years [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], cryptic invasions of European haplotypes of <italic>Phragmites</italic> beginning in the 1800s caused a dramatic increase in abundance and size of <italic>Phragmites</italic> stands, as well as aggressive colonization into freshwater and brackish marshes beyond the limits of the native&#x02019;s historic range [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. <italic>Phragmites</italic> alters a wide range of wetland ecosystem services. The dense, tall growth of <italic>Phragmites</italic> stands often cause local reductions in the native diversity of plant species following invasions [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. <italic>Phragmites</italic> is also often believed to provide poor habitat for native birds, fish, and invertebrates relative to native wetland plants [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] although it clearly provides habitat for some organisms [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For these and aesthetic reasons, management organizations in the United States invest considerable sums, an estimated $4.6 million annually [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], on the control and eradication of <italic>Phragmites</italic>. However, the same traits that allow <italic>Phragmites</italic> to form dense monocultures can also promote ecosystem services such as nutrient and pollutant remediation [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], shoreline stabilization [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and maintenance of wetland habitat in disturbed and urban areas [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Throughout many highly developed and agricultural regions of the United States, excessive nitrogen loading poses a particular challenge to managing local water quality. The invasive haplotypes of <italic>Phragmites</italic> are particularly adept at colonizing disturbed or nutrient-rich aquatic systems [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and once established reach heights of up to 4 meters and biomass densities of 727&#x02013;3663 g DM m<sup>-2</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Consequently, <italic>Phragmites</italic> can sequester much larger pools of nitrogen in biomass than can the native wetland plants it replaces [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. <italic>Phragmites</italic> also aerates wetland sediments that would otherwise remain anoxic [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], allowing for greater production of nitrate (nitrification) and thus greater removal of nitrogen to the atmosphere as inert dinitrogen gas (via denitrification) [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Though a great deal of research has focused on the removal of <italic>Phragmites</italic> through mechanical, chemical, or biological means [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], relatively few studies have quantified the effect of eradication on nitrogen-removal ecosystem services (but see [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]). Moreover, the characteristics of the plant communities that recolonize treated areas are even more infrequently characterized in terms of these services [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Our study sought to investigate the impacts of small-scale <italic>Phragmites australis</italic> removals on sediment nutrient concentrations and denitrification potential. Using two years of pre-removal monitoring data and two years of post-removal monitoring data, we compared the nitrogen removal rates of treated sites to intact <italic>Phragmites</italic> stands and sites dominated by native <italic>Typha angustifolia</italic>. We also assessed the species composition of treated sites two years following removal, and compared traits relevant to nitrogen removal between the recolonizing plant community and plant communities at sites dominated by <italic>Phragmites</italic> and <italic>Typha</italic>. We hypothesized that removal of <italic>Phragmites</italic> should lower rates of sediment aeration, thereby decreasing rates of nitrate production from ammonium via nitrification and reducing the supply of nitrate to denitrifying microbes. We further hypothesized that the absence of plant N uptake should further limit removal of ammonium from sediments to plant biomass. Therefore, we predicted that ammonium concentrations should increase in sediments following <italic>Phragmites</italic> removal and that denitrification potentials should decrease relative to vegetated plots. To our knowledge, this is only the second study to investigate the impacts of <italic>Phragmites</italic> removal on sediment denitrification potential [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and the first to have the opportunity to do so within replicated removal stands.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Site Description</title><p>In September 2010, the Eastern New York (ENY) Chapter of the Nature Conservancy, with permission from Audubon New York and the Scenic Hudson Land Trust, initiated small-scale (0.30&#x02013;0.76 ha) eradications of three stands of <italic>Phragmites australis</italic> from Ramshorn Marsh (N 42.216059, W -73.854959), a 308 ha freshwater tidal marsh located on the west shore of the Hudson river near Catskill, NY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149813.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Initial removals were performed with an application of Aquapro<sup>&#x02122;</sup> glyphosate herbicide (7.0 L/ha) and LI-700 aquatic surfactant (1.25 ppm) from a Marsh Master<sup>&#x02122;</sup> using a mounted spray system.

Four replicate locations were sampled in each of the stands. In August 2010, we expanded our pre-treatment survey to include three reference stands of <italic>Phragmites</italic>, one at Brandow Point (N 42.249440, W -73.824390) and two at West Flats (N 42.295549, W -73.786796), which were not selected for removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149813.g001">Fig 1</xref>). These sites were similar to Ramshorn in terms of sediment chemistry and hydrology prior to treatment [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and are located on the west shore of the Hudson River 5.4 km and 11.3 km northeast of Ramshorn Marsh, respectively. In 2010, we performed the same measurements conducted in 2009 at two locations within each <italic>Phragmites</italic> reference stand, one location within each <italic>Phragmites</italic> stand in Ramshorn designated for removal, and one paired <italic>Typha</italic>-dominated area near each Ramshorn <italic>Phragmites</italic> stand (total of 12 sampling locations). Following removal in September 2010, we repeated our measurements in September 2011, June 2012, and September 2012.

In September 2012 we received permission from the Nature Conservancy to add biomass and leaf carbon and nitrogen content measurements to sampling at Ramshorn locations as well. We harvested all aboveground biomass within two haphazardly placed quadrats (25 x 25 cm) within a 2 m radius of each sediment-sampling location.

A five gram subsample was amended with potassium nitrate (KNO<sub>3</sub>), glucose, chloramphenicol, and acetylene and incubated under anaerobic conditions for 90 minutes [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Headspace samples were collected at 30 and 90 minutes and stored in pre-evacuated glass vials. Gas samples were analyzed for N<sub>2</sub>O using electron capture gas chromatography. This method provides an indication of the amount of denitrifying enzyme present in the soil and has been demonstrated to be a reliable measurement for comparing the potential for microbial communities to perform denitrification among experimental treatments or sites. While useful for detection of relative changes in denitrification among treatment plots [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], these denitrification potentials should not be interpreted as a measure of absolute denitrification rates [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>A subsample of each core was also used to determine sediment moisture content as the change in mass after drying at 70&#x000b0;C for a minimum of 24 hr, total organic content as the loss after combustion at 450&#x000b0;C for 4 hr [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and total nitrogen and carbon content [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Differences in plant community composition among the three dominant vegetation types [<italic>Phragmites</italic>, <italic>Typha</italic>, Removal] were assessed using discriminant analysis of duplicate aboveground-biomass plots in September 2012. This method attempts to characterize an a priori grouping (in this case, three dominant vegetation types), based on a linear combination of predictor variables (in this case, biomass of the component species occupying the plots). If the plant community at the removal sites reverted to a <italic>Typha</italic>- or <italic>Phragmites</italic>-dominated community within the time frame of our study, the discriminant analysis would fail to distinguish the removal sites from one of these dominant vegetation types. If the plant community at removal sites switched to a novel community following herbicide treatment, the discriminant analysis would succeed in assigning removal plots to this novel vegetation type.</p><p>Differences in plant traits [aboveground biomass, leaf nitrogen content, total plant nitrogen content] measured in September 2012 among the three dominant vegetation types [<italic>Phragmites</italic>, <italic>Typha</italic>, Removal] were analyzed with a one-way ANOVA. A separate two-way ANOVA was used to compare <italic>Phragmites</italic> and <italic>Typha</italic> communities sampled at the reference sites at two additional sampling times [September 2011, June 2012, September 2012]. Measurements of sediment nitrogen and carbon collected August 2010-September 2012 were also analyzed with a two-way ANOVA to compare the three dominant vegetation groups. For each two-way ANOVA, potential interactions between vegetation type and sampling time were tested for significance.</p><p>Measurements of denitrification potential, sediment porewater nutrients, and total sediment organic content were analyzed at the stand scale using two-way ANOVA. Because the &#x0201c;Reference-<italic>Typha</italic>&#x0201d; treatment group was not added until September 2011, it was necessary to analyze the data using two different statistical designs. The first compared the three &#x0201c;treatments&#x0201d; [Ramshorn-Removal, Ramshorn-<italic>Typha</italic>, Reference-<italic>Phragmites</italic>] that were sampled across all &#x0201c;sampling times&#x0201d; [August 2010, September 2011, June 2012, September 2012], both before <italic>and</italic> after herbicide treatment. For these ANOVAs, significant impacts of herbicide treatment on dependent variables [denitrification potential, sediment ammonium content, and sediment organic content] were tested as planned comparisons within the interaction term (treatment x sampling time). In the second statistical design, we compared four treatments [Ramshorn-Removal, Ramshorn-<italic>Typha</italic>, Reference-<italic>Typha</italic>, Reference-<italic>Phragmites</italic>] for sampling times that occurred after herbicide treatment [September 2011, June 2012, September 2012]. For these ANOVAs, significance of herbicide treatment was assessed for the dependent variables listed above and additional measurements added in 2011 [total organic carbon and nitrogen content of sediments] using planned comparisons of treatments.</p><p>The sediment properties and processes we measured are notoriously variable as a result of measurement difficulties and spatial variability [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and sample size was necessarily limited due to the number of treatments conducted. For these reasons, our study was particularly susceptible to Type II error. To limit the likelihood of committing a Type II error, we adopted a higher &#x003b1; value of 0.1. Because the planned contrasts included in the ANOVAs described above are not orthogonal, we applied corrections for multiple comparisons using the false-discovery-rate method described in Benjamini and Hochberg [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This method has been shown to control the proportion of falsely rejected null hypotheses without sacrificing statistical power. Such methods are appropriate in cases such as ours when the failure to reject a false null (committing a Type II error) is equally as problematic as rejecting a true null (committing a Type I error) [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>Planned comparisons of Ramshorn-Removal and Reference-<italic>Phragmites</italic> sampling times were used to test for significant differences between sites where <italic>Phragmites</italic> was removed relative to sites where <italic>Phragmites</italic> was left intact. Planned comparisons of Reference-<italic>Typha</italic> and Reference-<italic>Phragmites</italic> were used to test whether sites dominated by plant species differed when left undisturbed. Though we attempted to control for phenology by sampling at peak biomass in each of our sampling years (late August/early September), we acknowledge that other factors such as temperature may influence sediment chemistry and microbial activity. The sampling conducted in June 2012 was added to provide further insight into the short-term trajectory of sediment recovery in treated sites. Planned comparisons of treatment and reference sites statistically control for interannual and seasonal variability when detecting treatment effects.

The impacts we observed in this study are consistent with the results of the only other study to examine changes in denitrification potential following eradication of <italic>Phragmites</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Although it is metabolically impossible for glyphosate itself to have a direct negative effect on prokaryotes, it is possible that the surfactant or other proprietary ingredients added with the herbicide may have affected the sediment microbial community [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. However, glyphosate and LI 700 surfactants have been demonstrated to have negligible effects on organisms other than plants and do not persist in biologically available form in aquatic environments, particularly in well-flushed tidal environments such as the one examined in this study [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Notably, our first post-removal measurements were conducted a full year after initial herbicide application. Due to this time lag and the considerable tidal flushing that occurs in Ramshorn Marsh, it is very unlikely that the herbicide itself could have persisted long enough to produce the effects we observed.</p><p>The effectiveness of <italic>Phragmites</italic> in promoting nitrogen-removal services, relative to native plant communities in our sites, is consistent with what one would expect based on extensive characterization of this plant invader [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. <italic>Phragmites</italic> is known to sequester larger pools of nitrogen in both above and belowground growth [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], as well as to aerate otherwise anoxic sediments [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], promoting removal of nitrogen via coupled nitrification-denitrification. Following herbicide treatment, assimilation of inorganic nitrogen into plant tissues would cease, and roots would no longer introduce oxygen to sediments, hindering oxidation of ammonium to nitrate. This sequence of events should result in a build-up of sediment ammonium, which we clearly observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149813.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Though total inorganic nitrogen levels increased, we expected denitrification potential to decrease due to limitation of denitrifying microbes by nitrate (oxidant). Not only did we observe an initial decrease in denitrification potential in treated sites relative to intact <italic>Phragmites</italic>-dominated reference sites, this effect persisted two years following the initial treatment, even as native plant communities began to recolonize the treated sites.</p><p>This study is one of the few that have characterized the plant community that recolonized sites following <italic>Phragmites</italic> eradication [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Consistent with those studies, we found that, rather than recovering to a similar native plant community found elsewhere in the marsh, the sites shifted to a completely different suite of species. The results of our vegetation surveys were consistent with surveys of 1.0 m<sup>2</sup> plots conducted by the Nature Conservancy at the same marsh locations [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In this case, the new community was characterized primarily by the presence of <italic>Leersia oryzoides</italic> and <italic>Polygonum arifolium</italic>, rather than <italic>Typha</italic>-dominated marshes that are typical of emergent wetlands in the Hudson River (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149813.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Notably, many of these species are commonly found in the understory of <italic>Typha</italic>-dominated marshes in the Hudson River, and may represent an early stage in the succession of a disturbed tidal marsh community in this system [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. This new community attained only 1/4 of the peak biomass of a <italic>Phragmites</italic>-dominated plant community and contained less than half the nitrogen content of a mature <italic>Phragmites</italic> leaf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149813.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). Overall, the capacity of this community to store nitrogen in aboveground tissue is severely reduced relative to both <italic>Phragmites</italic>- and <italic>Typha</italic>-dominated communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149813.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The net effect of species succession in this case could serve to increase the amount of time needed for a site to recover nitrogen-removal capacity following invasive species removal. Though we did not measure belowground traits of the plant communities, the lag in recovery of denitrification potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149813.g007">Fig 7</xref>) suggests that plant communities may also differ in their belowground effects on microbial processes. In order to fully understand impacts of plant-community alterations on ecosystem processes, belowground measurements should be given greater attention in future studies.</p><p>The success of <italic>Phragmites</italic> as an invader is often attributed to its ability to alter sediment nutrient cycles such that it has a competitive advantage relative to native plant species [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Specifically, <italic>Phragmites</italic> has been shown to increase pools of organic nitrogen relative to inorganic nitrogen in sediments, which other native plants are less efficient at assimilating [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Our results suggest that such a mechanism may be at work in the Hudson River. We found significantly higher concentrations of total organic nitrogen in sediments of <italic>Phragmites</italic>-dominated sites, relative to sites inhabited by native <italic>Typha</italic>-dominated plant communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149813.g004">Fig 4B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0149813.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Moreover, total aboveground biomass was negatively correlated with leaf nitrogen in native plant communities, which could be interpreted as a sign of nutrient competition within a plant community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149813.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). This correlation was much weaker for <italic>Phragmites</italic>, which is consistent with relaxed nutrient competition in <italic>Phragmites</italic>-dominated sites due to access to an additional pool of organic nitrogen. Relaxed nutrient competition, along with re-sprouting from rhizomes and quickly producing high aboveground biomass, may explain the difficulty in permanently eradicating stands of <italic>Phragmites</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Overall, <italic>Phragmites</italic>-dominated plant communities assimilate more nitrogen in aboveground biomass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149813.g003">Fig 3</xref>) and store more nitrogen in organic form in sediments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149813.g004">Fig 4</xref>) than native plant communities. Further, the removal of <italic>Phragmites</italic> resulted in significant increases in dissolved inorganic nitrogen pools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149813.g006">Fig 6</xref>) and significant decreases in the potential of the microbial community to permanently remove nitrogen to the atmosphere via denitrification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149813.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Together, these results suggest a management trade-off between eradicating <italic>Phragmites</italic> to restore a diverse native plant community and promoting nitrogen-removal ecosystem services in the wetland. Certainly, management actions such as seasonal timing of treatment or immediate replanting of native plants could help ameliorate these impacts, but follow-up herbicide treatments are always required, and some degree of disturbance is likely to be inevitable [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In light of this trade-off in management priorities, the question then becomes: When and where is <italic>Phragmites</italic> eradication likely to significantly impact local water quality? For small, isolated patches of <italic>Phragmites</italic> in a system like the Hudson, which is relatively hydrologically open and well flushed by periodic tidal inundation, the impact on water quality is likely to be quite small relative to the benefit of restoring native diversity and improving habitat conditions for wildlife. However, for systems in which <italic>Phragmites</italic> has become the major plant community in the landscape, complete eradication is not only unlikely [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] but may result in water quality problems that outweigh the benefits of biodiversity restoration, particularly for aquatic systems where water sources are smaller or hydrologically isolated. Invasive-species management highlights the need to develop specific management priorities for ecosystems. Frameworks are continually being developed that seek to simultaneously optimize multiple ecosystem services, with the understanding that management priorities may in some cases conflict [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p><p><italic>Phragmites</italic> management in the Hudson River Estuary provides one example of a situation in which biodiversity does not maximize delivery of an ecosystem service. In this case a dominant species with traits that maximize opportunistic nutrient acquisition and high biomass production also maximizes nitrogen-removal ecosystem services. In addition to nitrogen removal, <italic>Phragmites</italic> is credited with additional ecosystem services including carbon and heavy metal sequestration, soil stabilization, and habitat provisioning for both common and rare native animals [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Other exotic grasses have been found to store carbon and provide forage for grazing animals [<xref rid="pone.0149813.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Ecosystems dominated by invasive species and low-diversity communities challenge simple assumptions that biodiversity should beget greater value for multiple ecosystem functions. Particularly in urbanized and highly modified systems, invasive species like <italic>Phragmites</italic> can have quantifiable functional value both to the environment and local human societies that may not be easily achieved with native communities. In such cases, a holistic approach that begins with explicit management priorities, and considers potential trade-offs among management outcomes, is likely to provide the best solutions to management and restoration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec013"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The removal of invasive <italic>Phragmites australis</italic> from tidal freshwater marshes of the Hudson River resulted in a significant short-term increase in sediment ammonium concentrations, and a significant loss in denitrification potential that persisted for at least two years. These changes suggest the potential for an important trade-off between conserving native plant diversity and maintaining nitrogen-removal ecosystem services in wetland ecosystems. Therefore, management approaches that incorporate a balanced assessment of costs associated with keeping versus removing invasive plants are likely to provide the best outcomes for maintaining both biodiversity and water quality.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec014"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0149813.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Statistical Output and Code.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0149813.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Dianna Padilla, Jessica Gurevitch, and Alistair Rogers for helpful comments on earlier versions of this manuscript.
