<p>The most striking source of variation in denitrification potential was time, with average measurements varying nearly 8-fold among seasons and years (

 <xref rid="pone.0149813.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Nevertheless, denitrification potential in removal sites decreased significantly by approximately 50% relative to intact 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>-dominated reference locations (

 <xref rid="pone.0149813.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, p = 0.0471). This effect remained remarkably constant two years following initial herbicide application (

 <italic>Typha</italic> sites in September 2011, denitrification potentials were consistently highest in 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>-dominated sites, and were significantly higher than 
 <italic>Typha</italic>-dominated sites in Ramshorn Marsh at Î± = 0.10 (
