<p>In September 2011, one year following initial herbicide application, the removal sites in Ramshorn Marsh remained largely unvegetated, except for sparse regrowth of 
 <italic>Peltandra virginica</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149813.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). By September 2012 the removal sites had been colonized by a community dominated by 
 <italic>Leersia oryzoides</italic>, 
 <italic>Polygonum arifolium</italic>, 
 <italic>Peltandra virginica</italic>, 
 <italic>Impatiens capensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Scirpus fluviatilis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Scirpus tabernaemontani</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149813.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). This community was distinct in species composition from other marsh communities dominated by 
 <italic>Typha angustifolia</italic> or 
 <italic>Phragmites australis</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149813.g003">Fig 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Removal communities were also characterized by lower aboveground biomass (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149813.g004">Fig 4A</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) and leaf nitrogen content (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149813.g004">Fig 4B</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), relative to 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>-dominated reference sites. In all cases, 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>-dominated sites greatly exceeded other plant communities in aboveground biomass production and leaf nitrogen content (
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). For both 
 <italic>Typha</italic>-dominated communities and removal communities, leaf nitrogen content was negatively correlated with aboveground biomass at the plot level (p = 0.0023 and p = 0.0549, respectively). For 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>-dominated communities, this correlation was weak and of small effect (p = 0.3584, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149813.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Sediments in 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>-dominated sites on average contained slightly more organic carbon than 
 <italic>Typha</italic>-dominated sites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149813.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Sediment organic nitrogen, however, was significantly greater for 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>-dominated sites than 
 <italic>Typha</italic>-dominated sites, and slightly higher on average than in removal communities (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149813.g005">Fig 5B</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).
