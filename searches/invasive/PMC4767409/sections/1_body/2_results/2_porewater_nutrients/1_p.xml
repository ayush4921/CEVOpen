<p>Average porewater nitrate concentrations remained at or below 0.02 mg/L (i.e., the detection limit for our analytical methods) across all treatments throughout our study. Therefore, only results of porewater ammonium are reported. Following initial herbicide treatment, porewater ammonium concentrations in removal sites increased by over an order of magnitude relative to all vegetated sites (
