<p>Our study sought to investigate the impacts of small-scale 
 <italic>Phragmites australis</italic> removals on sediment nutrient concentrations and denitrification potential. Using two years of pre-removal monitoring data and two years of post-removal monitoring data, we compared the nitrogen removal rates of treated sites to intact 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> stands and sites dominated by native 
 <italic>Typha angustifolia</italic>. We also assessed the species composition of treated sites two years following removal, and compared traits relevant to nitrogen removal between the recolonizing plant community and plant communities at sites dominated by 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> and 
 <italic>Typha</italic>. We hypothesized that removal of 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> should lower rates of sediment aeration, thereby decreasing rates of nitrate production from ammonium via nitrification and reducing the supply of nitrate to denitrifying microbes. We further hypothesized that the absence of plant N uptake should further limit removal of ammonium from sediments to plant biomass. Therefore, we predicted that ammonium concentrations should increase in sediments following 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> removal and that denitrification potentials should decrease relative to vegetated plots. To our knowledge, this is only the second study to investigate the impacts of 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> removal on sediment denitrification potential [
