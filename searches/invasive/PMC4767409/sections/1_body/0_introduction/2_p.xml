<p>Wetlands have been found to be particularly susceptible to invasions by opportunistic plant invaders that form monotypic stands and displace native plant species. In fact, over 24% of the "worst plant invaders" are wetland plants [
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. One of the best known of these wetland plant invaders is 
 <italic>Phragmites australis</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> has been at least a minor component of brackish marshes in the United States for over 40,000 years [
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], cryptic invasions of European haplotypes of 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> beginning in the 1800s caused a dramatic increase in abundance and size of 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> stands, as well as aggressive colonization into freshwater and brackish marshes beyond the limits of the native’s historic range [
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> alters a wide range of wetland ecosystem services. The dense, tall growth of 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> stands often cause local reductions in the native diversity of plant species following invasions [

 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> is also often believed to provide poor habitat for native birds, fish, and invertebrates relative to native wetland plants [

 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] although it clearly provides habitat for some organisms [
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For these and aesthetic reasons, management organizations in the United States invest considerable sums, an estimated $4.6 million annually [
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], on the control and eradication of 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>. However, the same traits that allow 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> to form dense monocultures can also promote ecosystem services such as nutrient and pollutant remediation [

 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], shoreline stabilization [
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and maintenance of wetland habitat in disturbed and urban areas [
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].
