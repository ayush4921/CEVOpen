<p>Throughout many highly developed and agricultural regions of the United States, excessive nitrogen loading poses a particular challenge to managing local water quality. The invasive haplotypes of 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> are particularly adept at colonizing disturbed or nutrient-rich aquatic systems [
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and once established reach heights of up to 4 meters and biomass densities of 727â€“3663 g DM m
 <sup>-2</sup> [
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Consequently, 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> can sequester much larger pools of nitrogen in biomass than can the native wetland plants it replaces [
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> also aerates wetland sediments that would otherwise remain anoxic [
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], allowing for greater production of nitrate (nitrification) and thus greater removal of nitrogen to the atmosphere as inert dinitrogen gas (via denitrification) [
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Though a great deal of research has focused on the removal of 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> through mechanical, chemical, or biological means [
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], relatively few studies have quantified the effect of eradication on nitrogen-removal ecosystem services (but see [

 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]). Moreover, the characteristics of the plant communities that recolonize treated areas are even more infrequently characterized in terms of these services [
