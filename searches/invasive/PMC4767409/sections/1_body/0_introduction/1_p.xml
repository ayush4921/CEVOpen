<p>Invasive species are often presumed to degrade ecosystem functioning. By causing local extinctions, invasives are thought to reduce biodiversity [
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], which is often correlated to ecosystem functions [
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As many ecosystem functions provide essential services for human survival and well-being, these relationships imply that preservation of biodiversity is important for environmental management [
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], particularly when ecosystems provide multiple ecosystem services [
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Consequently, eradicating invasive species has become a common management practice. That said, invasive species are often better than native species at sequestering limiting resources into biomass [
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Conflicts between management goals can occur if, after invasion, this difference in ability results in improved nutrient storage or removal at the same time other services are degraded [
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Quantifying the effect of invaders on nutrient storage and removal processes is necessary to assess the full ecological effect of invasions, and to prioritize the allocation of limited management resources. This tradeoff may be especially important in wetlands. These ecosystems provide a diverse array of ecosystem services, including flood abatement, support for biodiversity, and improvement of water quality. Together these services have been valued at approximately $3000 per hectare annually [
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. At least 50% of the global wetland area has been lost to agricultural, urban, and rural development and much of the remaining wetlands are considered “degraded.” [
