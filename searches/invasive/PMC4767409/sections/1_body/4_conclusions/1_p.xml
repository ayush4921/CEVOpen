<p>The removal of invasive 
 <italic>Phragmites australis</italic> from tidal freshwater marshes of the Hudson River resulted in a significant short-term increase in sediment ammonium concentrations, and a significant loss in denitrification potential that persisted for at least two years. These changes suggest the potential for an important trade-off between conserving native plant diversity and maintaining nitrogen-removal ecosystem services in wetland ecosystems. Therefore, management approaches that incorporate a balanced assessment of costs associated with keeping versus removing invasive plants are likely to provide the best outcomes for maintaining both biodiversity and water quality.
