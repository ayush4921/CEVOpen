<p>In September 2011 and June 2012, we measured aboveground biomass and leaf carbon and nitrogen content for all locations sampled at the reference sites, but we refrained from collecting biomass samples at Ramshorn due to concerns that 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> regrowth could escape follow-up herbicide treatments if clipped. In September 2012 we received permission from the Nature Conservancy to add biomass and leaf carbon and nitrogen content measurements to sampling at Ramshorn locations as well. We harvested all aboveground biomass within two haphazardly placed quadrats (25 x 25 cm) within a 2 m radius of each sediment-sampling location. Harvested biomass was dried, weighed, and subsampled for analysis of leaf carbon and nitrogen content using a Perkin Elmer Series II CHNS Analyzer [

For September 2012 data, we identified harvested biomass to species and determined dry mass and leaf carbon and nitrogen content for each component plant species within each quadrat. Plot-level data for vegetation measurements were calculated as an average weighted by the biomass of the component species.
