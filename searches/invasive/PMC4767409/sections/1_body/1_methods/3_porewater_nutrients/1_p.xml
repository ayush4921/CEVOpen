<p>We measured sediment nutrient profiles using PVC porewater equilibrators with 12 ml sampling wells spaced vertically at 3 cm intervals. Equilibrators were filled with deionized water, covered with a Spectr-Por cellulose membrane, and deoxygenated overnight by bubbling with nitrogen gas prior to installation in sediments [

Porewater was collected from sampling wells using a syringe and stored in acidified vials until analysis. In 2009, samples were analyzed for ammonium and nitrate by ion chromatography and in all subsequent years using standard colorimetric methods [
