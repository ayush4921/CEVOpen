<p>We conducted an initial survey of denitrification potential, sediment organic content, and sediment ammonium and nitrate concentrations in the three 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> stands in Ramshorn Marsh in August 2009 prior to removal. Four replicate locations were sampled in each of the stands. In August 2010, we expanded our pre-treatment survey to include three reference stands of 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>, one at Brandow Point (N 42.249440, W -73.824390) and two at West Flats (N 42.295549, W -73.786796), which were not selected for removal (

 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and are located on the west shore of the Hudson River 5.4 km and 11.3 km northeast of Ramshorn Marsh, respectively. In 2010, we performed the same measurements conducted in 2009 at two locations within each 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> reference stand, one location within each 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> stand in Ramshorn designated for removal, and one paired 
 <italic>Typha</italic>-dominated area near each Ramshorn 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> stand (total of 12 sampling locations). Following removal in September 2010, we repeated our measurements in September 2011, June 2012, and September 2012. At each of these times, we sampled three locations in the reference 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> stands (hereafter “Reference-
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>”), three locations in the treated 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> stands (“Ramshorn-Removal”), and six locations in 
 <italic>Typha</italic>-dominated areas near each of the 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> stands (“Reference-
 <italic>Typha</italic>” and “Ramshorn-
 <italic>Typha</italic>”).
