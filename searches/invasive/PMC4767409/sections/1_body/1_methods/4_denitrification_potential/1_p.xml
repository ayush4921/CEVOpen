<p>Duplicate sediment cores from each sampling location were collected with a 7 cm diameter metal corer to a depth of ~10–15 cm for assays of denitrification potential. Samples were stored at 4°C and analyzed within 24 hours of sampling. A five gram subsample was amended with potassium nitrate (KNO
 <sub>3</sub>), glucose, chloramphenicol, and acetylene and incubated under anaerobic conditions for 90 minutes [

 <sub>2</sub>O using electron capture gas chromatography. This method provides an indication of the amount of denitrifying enzyme present in the soil and has been demonstrated to be a reliable measurement for comparing the potential for microbial communities to perform denitrification among experimental treatments or sites. While useful for detection of relative changes in denitrification among treatment plots [
