<p>Planned comparisons of Ramshorn-Removal and Reference-
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> sampling times were used to test for significant differences between sites where 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> was removed relative to sites where 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> was left intact. Planned comparisons of Reference-
 <italic>Typha</italic> and Reference-
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> were used to test whether sites dominated by plant species differed when left undisturbed. Though we attempted to control for phenology by sampling at peak biomass in each of our sampling years (late August/early September), we acknowledge that other factors such as temperature may influence sediment chemistry and microbial activity. The sampling conducted in June 2012 was added to provide further insight into the short-term trajectory of sediment recovery in treated sites. Planned comparisons of treatment and reference sites statistically control for interannual and seasonal variability when detecting treatment effects. All statistical analyses were performed in JMP [

 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Complete results of all statistical comparisons, false-discovery-rate corrections, and code used to generate figures are available in supporting information.
