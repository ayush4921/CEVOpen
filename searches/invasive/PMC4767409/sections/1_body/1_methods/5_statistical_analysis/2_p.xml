<p>Differences in plant traits [aboveground biomass, leaf nitrogen content, total plant nitrogen content] measured in September 2012 among the three dominant vegetation types [
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>, 
 <italic>Typha</italic>, Removal] were analyzed with a one-way ANOVA. A separate two-way ANOVA was used to compare 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> and 
 <italic>Typha</italic> communities sampled at the reference sites at two additional sampling times [September 2011, June 2012, September 2012]. Measurements of sediment nitrogen and carbon collected August 2010-September 2012 were also analyzed with a two-way ANOVA to compare the three dominant vegetation groups. For each two-way ANOVA, potential interactions between vegetation type and sampling time were tested for significance.
