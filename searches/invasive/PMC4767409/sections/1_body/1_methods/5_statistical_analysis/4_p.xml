<p>The sediment properties and processes we measured are notoriously variable as a result of measurement difficulties and spatial variability [
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and sample size was necessarily limited due to the number of treatments conducted. For these reasons, our study was particularly susceptible to Type II error. To limit the likelihood of committing a Type II error, we adopted a higher Î± value of 0.1. Because the planned contrasts included in the ANOVAs described above are not orthogonal, we applied corrections for multiple comparisons using the false-discovery-rate method described in Benjamini and Hochberg [
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This method has been shown to control the proportion of falsely rejected null hypotheses without sacrificing statistical power. Such methods are appropriate in cases such as ours when the failure to reject a false null (committing a Type II error) is equally as problematic as rejecting a true null (committing a Type I error) [
