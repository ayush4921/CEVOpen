<p>Differences in plant community composition among the three dominant vegetation types [
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>, 
 <italic>Typha</italic>, Removal] were assessed using discriminant analysis of duplicate aboveground-biomass plots in September 2012. This method attempts to characterize an a priori grouping (in this case, three dominant vegetation types), based on a linear combination of predictor variables (in this case, biomass of the component species occupying the plots). If the plant community at the removal sites reverted to a 
 <italic>Typha</italic>- or 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>-dominated community within the time frame of our study, the discriminant analysis would fail to distinguish the removal sites from one of these dominant vegetation types. If the plant community at removal sites switched to a novel community following herbicide treatment, the discriminant analysis would succeed in assigning removal plots to this novel vegetation type.
