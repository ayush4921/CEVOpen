<p>Measurements of denitrification potential, sediment porewater nutrients, and total sediment organic content were analyzed at the stand scale using two-way ANOVA. Because the “Reference-
 <italic>Typha</italic>” treatment group was not added until September 2011, it was necessary to analyze the data using two different statistical designs. The first compared the three “treatments” [Ramshorn-Removal, Ramshorn-
 <italic>Typha</italic>, Reference-
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>] that were sampled across all “sampling times” [August 2010, September 2011, June 2012, September 2012], both before 
 <italic>and</italic> after herbicide treatment. For these ANOVAs, significant impacts of herbicide treatment on dependent variables [denitrification potential, sediment ammonium content, and sediment organic content] were tested as planned comparisons within the interaction term (treatment x sampling time). In the second statistical design, we compared four treatments [Ramshorn-Removal, Ramshorn-
 <italic>Typha</italic>, Reference-
 <italic>Typha</italic>, Reference-
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>] for sampling times that occurred after herbicide treatment [September 2011, June 2012, September 2012]. For these ANOVAs, significance of herbicide treatment was assessed for the dependent variables listed above and additional measurements added in 2011 [total organic carbon and nitrogen content of sediments] using planned comparisons of treatments.
