<p>The removal of invasive 
 <italic>Phragmites australis</italic> had a significant negative impact on nitrogen-removal processes in Ramshorn Marsh, increasing sediment ammonium concentrations by an order of magnitude and reducing the ability of the sediment microbial community to remove nitrogen by 50% relative to 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>-dominated marshes. The impacts we observed in this study are consistent with the results of the only other study to examine changes in denitrification potential following eradication of 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Although it is metabolically impossible for glyphosate itself to have a direct negative effect on prokaryotes, it is possible that the surfactant or other proprietary ingredients added with the herbicide may have affected the sediment microbial community [
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. However, glyphosate and LI 700 surfactants have been demonstrated to have negligible effects on organisms other than plants and do not persist in biologically available form in aquatic environments, particularly in well-flushed tidal environments such as the one examined in this study [
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Notably, our first post-removal measurements were conducted a full year after initial herbicide application. Due to this time lag and the considerable tidal flushing that occurs in Ramshorn Marsh, it is very unlikely that the herbicide itself could have persisted long enough to produce the effects we observed.
