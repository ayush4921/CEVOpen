<p>The effectiveness of 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> in promoting nitrogen-removal services, relative to native plant communities in our sites, is consistent with what one would expect based on extensive characterization of this plant invader [

 <italic>Phragmites</italic> is known to sequester larger pools of nitrogen in both above and belowground growth [
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], as well as to aerate otherwise anoxic sediments [
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], promoting removal of nitrogen via coupled nitrification-denitrification. Following herbicide treatment, assimilation of inorganic nitrogen into plant tissues would cease, and roots would no longer introduce oxygen to sediments, hindering oxidation of ammonium to nitrate. This sequence of events should result in a build-up of sediment ammonium, which we clearly observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149813.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Though total inorganic nitrogen levels increased, we expected denitrification potential to decrease due to limitation of denitrifying microbes by nitrate (oxidant). Not only did we observe an initial decrease in denitrification potential in treated sites relative to intact 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>-dominated reference sites, this effect persisted two years following the initial treatment, even as native plant communities began to recolonize the treated sites.
