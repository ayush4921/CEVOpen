<p>The success of 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> as an invader is often attributed to its ability to alter sediment nutrient cycles such that it has a competitive advantage relative to native plant species [
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Specifically, 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> has been shown to increase pools of organic nitrogen relative to inorganic nitrogen in sediments, which other native plants are less efficient at assimilating [

 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Our results suggest that such a mechanism may be at work in the Hudson River. We found significantly higher concentrations of total organic nitrogen in sediments of 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>-dominated sites, relative to sites inhabited by native 
 <italic>Typha</italic>-dominated plant communities (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149813.g004">Fig 4B</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0149813.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Moreover, total aboveground biomass was negatively correlated with leaf nitrogen in native plant communities, which could be interpreted as a sign of nutrient competition within a plant community (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149813.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). This correlation was much weaker for 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>, which is consistent with relaxed nutrient competition in 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>-dominated sites due to access to an additional pool of organic nitrogen. Relaxed nutrient competition, along with re-sprouting from rhizomes and quickly producing high aboveground biomass, may explain the difficulty in permanently eradicating stands of 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> [
