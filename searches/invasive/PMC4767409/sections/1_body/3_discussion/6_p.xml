 <italic>Phragmites</italic> management in the Hudson River Estuary provides one example of a situation in which biodiversity does not maximize delivery of an ecosystem service. In this case a dominant species with traits that maximize opportunistic nutrient acquisition and high biomass production also maximizes nitrogen-removal ecosystem services. In addition to nitrogen removal, 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> is credited with additional ecosystem services including carbon and heavy metal sequestration, soil stabilization, and habitat provisioning for both common and rare native animals [

 <xref rid="pone.0149813.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Ecosystems dominated by invasive species and low-diversity communities challenge simple assumptions that biodiversity should beget greater value for multiple ecosystem functions. Particularly in urbanized and highly modified systems, invasive species like 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> can have quantifiable functional value both to the environment and local human societies that may not be easily achieved with native communities. In such cases, a holistic approach that begins with explicit management priorities, and considers potential trade-offs among management outcomes, is likely to provide the best solutions to management and restoration.
