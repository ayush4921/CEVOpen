  <title>Biplot of dicriminant analysis for three dominant vegetation classifications [
   <italic>Phragmites</italic>, 
   <italic>Typha</italic>, Removal] sampled in September 2012.
  </title>
  <p>Independent variables used to discriminate among the classifications were the biomasses of the component plant species at individual sampling plots. Rather than reverting from a 
   <italic>Phragmites</italic>-dominated (purple) to a typical 
   <italic>Typha</italic>-dominated community (green), communities shifted to a novel community characterized by 
   <italic>Leersia oryzoides</italic> and 
   <italic>Polygonum arifolium</italic> (brown) two years after initial herbicide treatment.
