 <caption> Biplot of dicriminant analysis for three dominant vegetation classifications [ Phragmites, Typha, Removal] sampled in September 2012. Independent variables used to discriminate among the classifications were the biomasses of the component plant species at individual sampling plots. Rather than reverting from a Phragmites-dominated (purple) to a typical Typha-dominated community (green), communities shifted to a novel community characterized by Leersia oryzoides and Polygonum arifolium (brown) two years after initial herbicide treatment. </caption>
