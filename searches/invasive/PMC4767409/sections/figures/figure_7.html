 <caption> Denitrification potentials of sediments before and after Phragmites removal in different vegetation types. Denitrification potentials at all sites showed substantial interannual and interseasonal variability. Relative to Phragmites-dominated sites (purple), denitrification potentials in removal sites (brown) decreased by 50% following initial herbicide treatment (vertical black line). This effect persisted for two years following removal. Error bars show standard errors. </caption>
