 <caption> Sediment ammonium content before and after Phragmites removal in different vegetation types. Following herbicide treatment in September 2010 (vertical black line), ammonium concentrations in sediments of treated sites increased by an order of magnitude relative to sites vegetated with Phragmites or Typha. Ammonium concentrations returned to pretreatment levels within two years of initial treatment. Error bars show standard errors. </caption>
