  <title>Differences in (A) aboveground biomass and (B) leaf nitrogen content among the three dominant vegetation classifications.</title>
  <p>
   <italic>Phragmites</italic>-dominated communities reach a higher peak biomass and assimilate more nitrogen per gram of leaf material than 
   <italic>Typha</italic>-dominated and removal communities. Boxplots represent the median and interquartile range, and whiskers extend to the most extreme point within 1.5 times the interquartile range. (C) The nitrogen content of leaves decreases with increasing biomass in 
   <italic>Typha</italic>-dominated (n = 24, slope
   <sub>SMA</sub> = -8.34, r = 0.59, p = 0.0023) and removal communties (n = 6, slope
   <sub>SMA</sub> = -9.92, r = 0.80, p = 0.0549), indicating nutrient limitation. Leaf nitrogen was not significantly correlated to aboveground biomass in 
   <italic>Phragmites</italic>-dominated communities (n = 18, slope
   <sub>SMA</sub> = -2.12, r = 0.23, p = 0.3584).
