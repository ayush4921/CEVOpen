 <caption> Differences in organic carbon and nitrogen in sediments among three dominant vegetation types. Sediments in Phragmites-dominated plant communities tend to contain (A) marginally higher organic-carbon content and (B) significantly higher organic nitrogen content than in Typha-dominated and removal communites. These results suggest the potential for higher organic-nitrogen storage in sediments in Phragmites-dominated sites. Boxplots represent the median and interquartile range, and whiskers extend to the most extreme point within 1.5 times the interquartile range. </caption>
