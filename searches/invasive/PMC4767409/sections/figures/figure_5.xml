  <title>Differences in organic carbon and nitrogen in sediments among three dominant vegetation types.</title>
  <p>Sediments in 
   <italic>Phragmites</italic>-dominated plant communities tend to contain (A) marginally higher organic-carbon content and (B) significantly higher organic nitrogen content than in 
   <italic>Typha</italic>-dominated and removal communites. These results suggest the potential for higher organic-nitrogen storage in sediments in 
   <italic>Phragmites</italic>-dominated sites. Boxplots represent the median and interquartile range, and whiskers extend to the most extreme point within 1.5 times the interquartile range.
