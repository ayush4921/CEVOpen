<p>Functional traits are defined as morpho‐physio‐phenological traits (Cornelissen, 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>; Violle et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0115" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>) that are linked with the niche and fitness of a species (Drenovsky et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Eisenhauer, Schulz, Scheu, &amp; Jousset, 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Funk et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Functional groups are group of species whose traits are similar to each other. According to Fox's assembly rule, when a native community lacks a particular functional group, the community is easily invaded by an invader that belongs to that functional group based on limiting similarity (Fox, 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">1987</xref>; Von Holle &amp; Simberloff, 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0116" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). In several studies, a predefined functional group, such as one defined by growth form, was used to test the effect of functional groups on invasion (Booth et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>; Gooden &amp; French, 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Pokorny et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0087" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>; Prieur‐Richard, Lavorel, Grigulis, &amp; Dos Santos, 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0089" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>; Sheley &amp; James, 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0098" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Symstad, 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0108" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>; Tilman, 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0112" ref-type="ref">1997b</xref>; Von Holle &amp; Simberloff, 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0116" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>), but these particular groups often ignored functional traits that might be relevant to biotic resistance. For example, some invasive species exploit temporal niches when these are not occupied by other species (Wilsey, Daneshgar, &amp; Polley, 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0121" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Wolkovich &amp; Cleland, 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0122" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>); therefore, functional traits related to life‐history strategies, such as life span, can determine the timing of species establishment and possible competitive interactions. Species that establish early and grow rapidly may pre‐empt niches, leading to inhibition of the slow‐growing species in a community assemblage (Mwangi et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0079" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). Therefore, the classification of species into functional groups based on several relevant traits is essential to relate functional group identity with biotic resistance.
