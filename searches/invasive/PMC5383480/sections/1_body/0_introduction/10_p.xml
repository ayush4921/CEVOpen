<p>Diversity–interaction models (Kirwan et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) permit predictions of the relationship between diversity and biotic resistance across communities of different compositions by comparing different models based on different ecological assumptions concerning species interactions. When combined with a functional group approach, diversity–interaction models promise to reveal new insights into mechanisms of resistance to invasion (Frankow‐Lindberg,
