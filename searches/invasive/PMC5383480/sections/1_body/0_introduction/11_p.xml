<p>The focus of this research was on the processes that influence the outcome of community assembly when a site is disturbed, with the goal to limit establishment of an invasive species such as 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic>. Successful establishment of 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> depends on the level of biotic resistance, which is the ability of other plant species to limit the success of invasions. Therefore, the primary objective was to understand the determinants of biotic resistance to invasion in a plant community assembly using 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> as a model. Based on the assumption that some species, or combination of species, are more resistant to invasion than others, we hypothesized that certain functional groups will be most resistant to invasion, whereas the species effect will be redundant within each functional group. Based on the hypothesis of limiting similarity, we hypothesized that the functional group of which 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> was a member would be more resistant than other groups. Additionally, we hypothesized that a mixture of species will be more resistant to invasion than a monoculture of a species (a diversity effect), and we asked how species interact to produce such a diversity effect.
