<p>Invasive plants, including 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic>, are commonly controlled by mowing, burning, or applying herbicide (Derr, 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>; Kettenring &amp; Adams, 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Controlling invasive plants requires repeated application of herbicide (Derr, 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>) or covering with black plastic for solarization (Marushia &amp; Allen, 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0073" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Herbicide application is expensive and contributes to other environmental problems such as bioaccumulation in food web systems. After establishment, management costs for invasive species increase dramatically, and, when an invasive plant creates a dense mat of rhizomes and is ready to spread, complete eradication becomes almost impossible. Furthermore, eradication of an invasive plant does not guarantee natural recovery of native plants (Reid, Morin, Downey, French, &amp; Virtue, 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0093" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; but see also Thomsen, Brownell, Groshek, &amp; Kirsch,

 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Moreover, methods of eradication can create a disturbance on bare ground, which facilitates re‐invasion (Buckley, Bolker, &amp; Rees, 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Iannone &amp; Galatowitsch,
