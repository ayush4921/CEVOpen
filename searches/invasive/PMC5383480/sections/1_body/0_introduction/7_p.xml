<p>First, the mechanism of competition‐based biotic resistance is a function of which species are the most resistant to invasive plants. Based on niche difference, native species repel invasive plants through competitive exclusion (MacDougall, Gilbert, &amp; Levine, 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0071" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). A theory of limiting similarity originated from classical competition theories (Macarthur &amp; Levins, 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0070" ref-type="ref">1967</xref>; Weltzin, Muth, Von Holle, &amp; Cole, 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0120" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>), and the theory proposes that there is a limit to niche overlap or similarity in resource use between native species and invading species. Based on mechanisms of competition, invading species cannot establish in a niche similar to that of a native species (Funk et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). When niches overlap, the species with superior fitness (competitive ability) will prevail (MacDougall et al.,
