<p>Second, the diversity effect is an indication of how combinations of species resist invasion. This effect is related to niche partitioning, which leads to coexistence among native species and the diversity effect on invasive plants. According to the diversity–resistance hypothesis (Elton, 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">1958</xref>), the uptake of available resources and the occupation of niches are more complete in a species‐rich community, which prevents invasion. Niche partitioning is observed when resources are partitioned as the species of neighboring plants and the canopy complexity increase (Ashton, Miller, Bowman, &amp; Suding, 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Booth, Caldwell, &amp; Stark, 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>; Frankow‐Lindberg, 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Summarizing the research to date, compared with one particular alternative species, developing a seed mixture that contains three or four species will lead to a diverse plant community that can maintain biotic resistance in a changing environment and prevent re‐invasion by invasive plants.
