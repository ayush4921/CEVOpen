<p>Comparisons between pairs of diversity–interaction models fitted to the experimental data set revealed distinctive species interaction patterns by functional group that contributed to biotic resistance. The functional group identity effect terms fitted as well as species identity effect terms (Model 1 vs. Model 2; 
 <italic>F</italic>‐test; 
 <italic>p </italic>=
 <italic> </italic>.171, AIC: 30.99 vs. 27.26). The evidence was strong for an average interaction term effect (diversity effect) (Model 2 vs. Model 3; 
 <italic>F</italic>‐test; 
 <italic>p </italic>=
 <italic> </italic>.003, AIC: 27.26 vs. 20.82). The species interaction by functional group (species interaction within and between functional groups) terms fitted much better than the single average interaction term (Model 3 vs. Model 4, 
 <italic>F</italic>‐test; 
 <italic>p </italic>=
 <italic> </italic>.001, AIC: 20.82 vs. 11.55). However, the separate pairwise species interactions terms did not fit better than the species interaction by functional group term (Model 4 vs. Model 5; 
 <italic>F</italic>‐test; 
 <italic>p </italic>=
 <italic> </italic>.579; AIC: 11.55 vs. 13.18). No evidence of significant species interaction within each functional group was detected (Model 4 vs. Model 6, 
 <italic>F</italic>‐test; 
 <italic>p </italic>=
 <italic> </italic>.725, AIC: 11.55 vs. 7.09). Thus, Model 6 (functional group identity effect and species interaction between functional groups) was chosen for the final model prediction because it fitted as well as the complex models with separate pairwise species interactions. Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32799-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a shows Model 6 predictions on the effect of functional group composition in seed mixtures on biotic resistance to invasion by

 <xref rid="ece32799-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b shows the identical model prediction when the model was fitted to aboveground biomass instead of RCI
 <sub>avg</sub> of resident plants. In either case, a positive interaction was found between FG1 and FG3 in their contribution to biotic resistance. The highest RCI
 <sub>avg</sub> and aboveground biomass were estimated for a mixture of FG1 and FG3 at a ratio of 2 to 1, approximately.
