<p>An additive competition design was applied to test the competitive effect of resident species on 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> (Connolly, Wayne, &amp; Bazzaz, 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>; Keddy, Twolan‐Strutt, &amp; Wisheu, 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">1994</xref>; Snaydon, 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0101" ref-type="ref">1991</xref>). Each treatment pot received the seeds of 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> and those of native plants. For the 12 monoculture treatments, one native species per pot was used. For the seven mixture treatments, four randomly chosen native species per pot were used. Control pots received only seeds of 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic>. All species in monocultures or mixtures were sown in early March 2016 with the seeds of 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> in treatments or the control. Each seeding density of native plant(s) and 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> was total 300 viable seeds per each pot. Control pot received 300 viable seeds of 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> only. The sowing density was approximately 8,000 live seeds/m
 <sup>2</sup>. Treatments were applied in a randomized complete block design, with three replicates per treatment.
