<p>Including the 22 species, 37 total plant species for broad interpretation, which included four typical invasive plants (
 <italic>Ambrosia trifida</italic>,
 <italic> Ageratina altissima</italic>,
 <italic> Sicyos angulatus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Aster pilosus</italic>), in the capital area of Seoul, South Korea, were classified into three functional groups with the cluster analysis with ward option using the 
 <italic>hclust</italic> function in the R program (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32799-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Functional groups differed from one another primarily by life span, growth form, and woodiness traits. The three functional groups were FG1 for annual plants, FG2 for perennial herbaceous plants, and FG3 for perennial woody plants. Details of the characteristics of each functional group are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="ece32799-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap">1</xref>. Species nomenclature and status (native or introduced) in this study followed the Flora of North America (Flora of North America Editorial, 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">1993</xref>) and the database of Vascular Plants of Canada (VASCAN), respectively.
