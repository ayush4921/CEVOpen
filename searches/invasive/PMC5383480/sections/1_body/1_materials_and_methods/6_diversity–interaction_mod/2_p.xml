<p>Diversity–interaction models (Kirwan et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) were used to investigate species interaction patterns that contributed to biotic resistance in the mixture treatments. Comparisons of models based on different ecological assumptions were used to test alternative hypotheses about the relative role of functional groups and functional redundancy in biotic resistance (Kirwan et al.,
