<p>Seeds of 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> were collected on the campus of Seoul National University in November 2015. Most seeds of native plants were purchased from seed suppliers. Seed viability among native plants was standardized by applying the identical number of viable seeds per species to experimental units. To determine pure live seeds, a germination test was conducted. All seeds were cold‐stratified at 3°C before the germination test, following standard methods (Lindig‐Cisneros &amp; Zedler, 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0065" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). Before the experiment, 100 seeds per species were placed in each of three Petri dishes with filter paper (Whatman
 <sup>®</sup> No. 1) moistened with 6 ml of distilled water under fluorescent light. The species with a germination rate below 3% were excluded. Among 22 species, the germination rate was above 3% for only 12 species. Viable seeds per species, not seedlings, were applied in the pot experiments.
