<p>At the end of July 2016, the number of shoots, aboveground biomass, plant height, and plant cover of 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> in each treatment and control pot were measured to calculate the primary response variable (see below). Additionally, plant cover, plant height, and aboveground biomass of all native plants were measured to correlate these variables with the response variables. For aboveground biomass, the aboveground portion of plants was harvested at the end of July and then weighed following drying at 80°C for 48 hr. Plant height was estimated for each species to the closest 0.5 cm. The RCI (relative competition index) was calculated to estimate the competitive effect of native plant(s) on 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> using the following equation (Weigelt &amp; Jolliffe,

 </disp-formula>where RCI is the relative competition index of a native plant on 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> in either monoculture or mixture for a given variable Y (i.e., number of shoots, aboveground biomass, plant height, or plant cover of 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic>). Y
 <sub>control</sub> is the performance of 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> in the control, and Y
 <sub>treatment</sub> is the performance of 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> in a treatment. Because RCI
 <sub>number of shoots</sub>, RCI
 <sub>biomass</sub>, RCI
 <sub>height</sub>, and RCI
 <sub>plant cover</sub> were highly correlated with one another, RCI
 <sub>avg</sub> was calculated, which is the arithmetic mean of RCI
 <sub>number of shoots</sub>, RCI
 <sub>biomass</sub>, RCI
 <sub>height</sub>, and RCI
 <sub>plant cover</sub>, as the primary response variable for all analyses. A value of 0 for RCI
 <sub>avg</sub> indicated no competitive effect on 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic>, a value of 1 indicated complete competitive exclusion of 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic>, and a negative RCI indicated facilitation of the establishment and growth of 
 <italic>A. altissima</italic> by native plants.
