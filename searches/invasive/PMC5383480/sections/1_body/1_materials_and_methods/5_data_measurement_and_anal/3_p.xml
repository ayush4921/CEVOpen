<p>For the monoculture treatments in the experiment, ANOVA was used to test for functional group identity effect and species identity effect nested within each functional group on RCI
 <sub>avg</sub>. A generalized linear mixed model (REML; 
 <italic>F</italic>‐test) was used for this test to account for the random block effect (Bolker et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Normality of residuals and homoscedasticity were evaluated, and the response variables were transformed when necessary. When a significant functional group effect was detected, the means of functional groups were compared using a contrast test on each pair of functional groups. When a significant species identity effect within each functional group was detected, Tukey's HSD multiple comparison test was used to compare means of species identity effect for each functional group.
