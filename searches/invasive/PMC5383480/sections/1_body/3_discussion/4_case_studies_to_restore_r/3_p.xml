<p>Based on empirical evidence, restoring plant species increases biotic resistance. Depending on seed configuration, environment, and invasive plant, plant restoration results in an approximate reduction in invasion ability of 50–100%. In most experiments, invasive plants survived regardless of plant restoration, with the exception of those in the present experiment. In conclusion, biotic resistance alone may not prevent invasive plants completely (Levine, Adler, &amp; Yelenik, 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>); however, biotic resistance contributes to constraining the abundance of invasive plants and determines the identity of an invasive plant at regional scales (Davies, Cavender‐Bares, &amp; Deacon,
