<p>The present study indicates that the guiding ecological principles to understand and/or manage, if desired, biological invasions could emerge from advances in community theory and the use of a functional framework. To facilitate generalization, widely distributed invasive plants should be targeted in different contexts and the results should be scaled‚Äêup to field conditions.</p>
