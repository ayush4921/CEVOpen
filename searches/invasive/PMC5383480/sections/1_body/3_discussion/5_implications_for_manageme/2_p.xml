<p>Restoration has many advantages over methods of eradication; restoration is self‐regenerative (not requiring repeated application), is less of a threat to native, desirable species, and prevents disturbance that stimulates re‐invasion by invasive plants (Simmons, 
 <xref rid="ece32799-bib-0100" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). Therefore, restoration of native plant cover is an alternative, innovative method to protect native species from invasive plants. Practical designs for restoration include some technical questions that must be answered such as how to select and how to combine species for restoration and how to identify appropriate environmental conditions for restoration. However, information on the use of native plant restoration as an alternative to control invasions continues to be lacking (Hazelton, Mozdzer, Burdick, Kettenring, &amp; Whigham,
