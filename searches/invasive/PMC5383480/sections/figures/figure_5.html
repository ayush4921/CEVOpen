 <caption> Predictions of biodiversity–interaction models on the effect of functional group composition on (a) RCI avg: relative competition index of resident plant(s) as an indicator of biotic resistance (see Equation  (1)) and (b) aboveground biomass (g) of resident plant(s) per pot. Each corner of the ternary plot represents the monoculture of each functional group, whereas the inner area of the plot represents the mixtures of functional groups. For details on the model equation, see Equation  (7) </caption>
