<p>To examine the effect of environmental heterogeneity on the plant diversity and species distribution within communities invaded by 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic>, we first established an environmental matrix containing eight environmental factors (20 × 8), with a plant diversity matrix containing four indices (20 × 4) and a relative 
 <italic>IV</italic> matrix containing 15 plant species (20 × 15). We then conducted detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) using the quantitative ordination software Canoco 4.5 (Microcomputer Power, New York, USA) to predict whether the linear or unimodal model would be appropriate for use. The results indicated that both of the longest gradient lengths of the plant diversity matrix and relative 
 <italic>IV</italic> matrix were less than three standard deviations, thus, we preferred to perform redundancy analysis (RDA) (

 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> invasion matrix containing nine biotic traits (20×9) and used the same method to examine the effect of 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> invasion on plant diversity. The variable in the RDA ordination diagram that presented the highest value of the correlation coefficient was indicated to be the main determinant factor of this ordination axis. We performed a Monte Carlo permutation test based on 499 random permutations to test the significance of the correlation coefficient (
