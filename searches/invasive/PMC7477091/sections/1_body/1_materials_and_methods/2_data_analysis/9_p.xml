<p>We used regression analysis to examine the relationships between eight environmental factors (longitude, latitude, elevation, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, nitrate nitrogen, temperature, and precipitation) and the nine biotic traits of 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> (abundance, height, species cover, the total carbon content of the leaves, and stems, the total nitrogen content of the leaves and stems, and the C:N ratio of the leaves and stems). We applied 11 regression models (linear, quadratic, compound, growth, logarithmic, cubic, 
 <italic>S</italic>, exponential, inverse, power, and logistic) provided in SPSS 16.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). Then, we selected the best-fitting models showing the maximum fitting coefficient (
 <italic>R
  <sup>2</sup>
 </italic>) and a significant 
 <italic>P</italic> value (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). We used the same method to examine the relationship between the relative 
 <italic>IV</italic> of 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> and four species diversity indices.
