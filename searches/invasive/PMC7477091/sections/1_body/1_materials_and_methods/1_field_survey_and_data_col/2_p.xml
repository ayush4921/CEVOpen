<p>We recorded the longitude, latitude and elevation within each plot using a handheld GPS receiver (Garmin eTrex 20, Kansas, USA). The conductivity and dissolved oxygen and nitrate nitrogen contents of the water were measured using a YSI water quality analyzer (Professional Plus, Ohio, USA). We successively calibrated the nitrate nitrogen sensor of the YSI analyzer with 100 mg/L and 1 mg/L standard solutions before measuring the water quality. The data probes were inserted below the water surface at a depth of 20 cm, and the data were read when a stable display was observed (

We obtained and calculated accurate data for the mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation of every sampling plot in the last 50 years from the database of the National Meteorological Center, China Meteorological Administration (
