<p>During July and August 2014, we conducted a field survey of invasive 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> in Hunan, Guangxi and Guangdong Provinces in southern China. We selected ponds or rivers in which 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> covered an area of more than 100 m
 <sup>2</sup>. We set 20 plots (10 m × 10 m, at least 10 km apart) spanning a latitudinal gradient from 21°N to 28°N (as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">
  <bold>Figure 1</bold>
 </xref>). Three 10 m transects were evenly set up in each plot, and five quadrats (0.5 m × 0.5 m) were uniformly spaced 2 m apart in each transect. We used the measurement methods of 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al. (2017)</xref> to record the species name, height, coverage, and abundance of each plant species in every quadrat. After the investigation of the plant community, we randomly collected the aboveground portions of eight 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> individuals from each plot and stored them separately in sealed plastic bags filled with silicone. These plant samples were then brought back to the laboratory to measure the total carbon and total nitrogen contents of the leaves and stems of 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> by using a vario TOC cube analyzer (Elementar, Germany), and the stoichiometric C:N ratios (total carbon/total nitrogen) in the leaves and stems were calculated.
