<p>Global change, such as climatic warming, nitrogen deposition, and extreme hydrological events, could optimize the ecological and physiological traits of alien species, greatly facilitating their introduction and establishment in new habitats (

 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Probert et al., 2020</xref>). As an emerging driver of global change, plant invasions alter species interactions and threaten plant diversity and ecosystem functioning worldwide, causing serious damage to the associated microhabitats (

According to previous studies, many factors that affect the impacts of invasive plants on native plant diversity can be classified into two main categories. One of them is the spatial environmental heterogeneity, which emphasizes abiotic factors such as latitude, nitrogen, climate warming, and precipitation (

 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2016</xref>;

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Budzyńska et al., 2019</xref>). For instance, warming could increase the interspecific competitiveness of invasive plants, while the increasing latitude might exacerbate their enemy releases at high latitudinal regions with colder climate (

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Allen et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). The other is invasive plant traits that determine their invasiveness, including phenotypic plasticity, biomass allocation, and fecundity, as invasive plants in invaded habitats usually have the higher abundance, individual size, seed output, and germination than in their origins (

 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Rejmánková et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, higher plant diversity could confer biotic resistance against plant invasions at regional scales, while global environmental changes may significantly alter the physiological and/or ecological traits of invasive plants and exacerbate their negative impacts on native cooccurring plants (

 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Wu and Ding, 2019</xref>). Thus, exploring the abiotic and biotic determinants of plant diversity in invaded ecosystems is critical for predicting plant invasions and conserving native biodiversity under rapid global change (
