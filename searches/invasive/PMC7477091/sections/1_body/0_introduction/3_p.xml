<p>Water hyacinth, 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic>, which is a free-floating aquatic macrophyte native to South America, has widely invaded freshwater systems in over 50 countries (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Villamagna and Murphy, 2010</xref>). It has been listed as one of the most detrimental aquatic invasive plant species in southern China (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bai et al., 2013</xref>). 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> often covers the water surface, obstructs rivers, decreases dissolved oxygen, reduces native aquatic plant diversity and even threatens human health by providing a refuge for mosquitoes (

 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Villamagna and Murphy, 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). Many recent studies on 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> have mainly focused on topics such as its biological control and clonal integration, water purification and the interactions of 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> with herbivores (

 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Pi et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2019</xref>); however, how abiotic factors and the biotic determinants of plant diversity affect the impact of 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> is largely unknown. Given that 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> shows superior abilities in terms of rapid growth, nutrient absorption, and environmental adaptation (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">You et al., 2014</xref>) and climate change is ongoing (
 <italic>e.g.</italic>, warming and frequent floods), this invasive plant may expand its northern boundaries to higher latitudes and thus cause larger negative impacts on aquatic plant diversity in these regions (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Hoveka et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Wu and Ding, 2019</xref>). Therefore, understanding the biotic traits and ecological effects of 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> under global environmental changes is critical for accurately predicting its future invasion trends and conserving native biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems.
