<p>A total of 15 plant species in eight families and 14 genera were recorded in our 20 plots. Poaceae exhibited the greatest richness, with five species in our plots, followed by Pontederiaceae and Polygonaceae, which both presented two species (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">
  <bold>Supplementary Table 2</bold>
 </xref>). Among all species in the communities, 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> exhibited the greatest total importance value (
 <italic>IV</italic> = 17.818). The other primary accompanying species based on the total 
 <italic>IV</italic> were 
 <italic>Paspalum distichum</italic> (
 <italic>IV</italic> = 0.660), 
 <italic>Monochoria vaginalis</italic> (
 <italic>IV</italic> = 0.347) and 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> (
 <italic>IV</italic> = 0.279). The ranges of the four species diversity indices in each plot were as follows: Patrick richness index (1–5), Simpson diversity index (0–0.554), Shannon–Wiener diversity index (0–1.056), and Pielou evenness index (0-0.675).
