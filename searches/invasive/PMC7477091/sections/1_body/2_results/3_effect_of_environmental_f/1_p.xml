<p>For the relationship between the environmental factors and species distributions, the cumulative percentage variance explained by the first two canonical RDA axes was 76.40% (47.60% for axis1 and 28.8% for axis2, see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">
  <bold>Figure 3B</bold>
 </xref>). Longitude was significantly positively related to axis1 (coefficient = 0.858, 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) and elevation was significantly negatively related to axis1 (coefficient = −0.531, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), while dissolved oxygen was significantly negatively related to axis2 (coefficient = −0.547, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">
  <bold>Figure 3B</bold>
 </xref>), 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> (1) was strongly negatively correlated with longitude and dissolved oxygen but slightly positively correlated with elevation. 
 <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> (10) and 
 <italic>Acorus calamus</italic> (11) were both strongly positively correlated with longitude. 
 <italic>P. distichum</italic> (2) and 
 <italic>M. vaginalis</italic> (3) were positively correlated with elevation, while 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> (4), 
 <italic>Polygonum hydropiper</italic> (14) and 
 <italic>Humulus scandens</italic> (15) were all strongly negatively correlated with elevation. The species exhibiting strong correlations with high dissolved oxygen were 
 <italic>Beckmannia syzigachne</italic> (5) and 
 <italic>Arthraxon hispidus</italic> (6), while 
 <italic>Echinochloa phyllopogon</italic> (8) and 
 <italic>Hydrocharis dubia</italic> (9) were highly negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen. In addition, 
 <italic>Fimbristylis dichotoma</italic> (12), 
 <italic>Leersia hexandra</italic> (13), 
 <italic>O. sativa</italic> (10), and 
 <italic>A. calamus</italic> (11) were extremely negatively correlated with 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic>, as their vector directions in our RDA biplot were almost opposite (
