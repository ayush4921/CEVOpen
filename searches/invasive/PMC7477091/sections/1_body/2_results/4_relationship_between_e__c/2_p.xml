<p>According to the RDA results (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">
  <bold>Table 2</bold>
 </xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">
  <bold>Figure 5</bold>
 </xref>), the cumulative percentage of variance explaining the 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> traits–diversity index relationships of the first two canonical axes reached 99.80% (91.0% for axis1 and 8.80% for axis2). Species cover and leaf C:N were the primary biotic determinants of plant diversity, which were all significantly positively related to axis1 (coefficient = 0.522, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; coefficient = 0.501, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, respectively). The abundance of 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> was significantly positively related to axis2 (coefficient = 0.567, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The Simpson and Shannon–Wiener diversity and Pielou evenness index and were strongly negatively correlated with 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> cover and abundance, while the Patrick richness index was slightly negatively correlated with these two traits. The four diversity indices were also strongly negatively correlated with the leaf C:N ratio of 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic>, especially the Patrick richness index (

  <bold>Figure 5</bold>
 </xref>). The remaining other traits exhibited no significant relationship with the RDA axes.
