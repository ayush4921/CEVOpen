<p>A previous study showed species diversity of hydrophytes increases from the northwest to the southeast with increasing longitude in China (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2006</xref>), and this pattern was applied to the 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic>-invaded communities in this study. It might be related to changes in water salinity and hydrological variability along the longitudinal gradient. Moreover, the diverse rugged aquatic landscapes and water-level fluctuations caused by the variable rainfall patterns across longitudes may also support higher hydrophyte diversity and thus resist aquatic plant invasions (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Goldblatt, 1997</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Alahuhta et al., 2018</xref>). With an increase in elevation, habitat filtering plays a stronger role in shaping the biological community assemblage, especially for the aquatic plant community (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Laliberte et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Wang, 2018</xref>). A phenomenon similar to the higher species diversity of hygrophytes in lower-elevation regions observed in our 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> community has been found in the Yangtze River of China (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Wang, 2018</xref>). Elevated dissolved oxygen and precipitation could alleviate the interspecific competition between invasive and native aquatic plants (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Ji et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Lacet et al., 2019</xref>), thus increasing the Shannon–Wiener and Simpson diversity indices and Pielou evenness index. However, as a measure of salinity, conductivity has been proven to have strong detrimental effects on native hydrophyte diversity but to facilitate aquatic alien plant invasions, as these invasive plants are always salt tolerant (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Nielsen et al., 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Pulzatto et al., 2019</xref>). The Patrick richness index was weakly affected by the water environment, likely due to the low plant richness in the invaded community. In fact, in some sampling plots, 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> was the only species present; thus, the Patrick richness index was insensitive to microhabitat changes. In the RDA biplot, 
 <italic>Oryza sativa</italic>, 
 <italic>A. calamus</italic>, 
 <italic>F. dichotoma</italic>, and 
 <italic>L. hexandra</italic> showed exerted negative effects on 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic>, likely due to their superior properties related to the resistance of biological invasions, such as taller growth or tillering growth, allowing them to coexist for a long time in this invaded community. Consistent with our previous studies on aquatic 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides-</italic>invaded community (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2017</xref>), in this study, we found the plant diversity of the 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> community increased as longitude increased. These findings have important implications for predicting aquatic plant invasions and their effects on plant diversity. For example, the rainfall in mainland China would continuously increase with increasing longitude under ongoing climate change, which my further improve aquatic invasive plant growth (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Anufriieva and Shadrin, 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Wu and Ding, 2019</xref>). Additionally, more frequent anthropogenic activities in high longitude in China could result in more pollutants, 
 <italic>e.g.</italic>, organic compounds, nitrogen, and phosphorus, subsequently leading to water eutrophication and then facilitating aquatic invasive plant invasions (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Le et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Wu and Ding, 2019</xref>). Together, all the above-mentioned factors could trigger aquatic plant invasions and then negatively change plant diversity of aquatic invaded communities across longitudes. Therefore, more attention should be paid to the species diversity of aquatic invasive plant communities along a longitudinal gradient at large biogeographical scales compared to the LDG rule (latitudinal diversity gradient) of their terrestrial counterparts (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2016</xref>).
