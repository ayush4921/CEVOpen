<p>In summary, in this study, we identified the abiotic and biotic determinants of plant diversity in 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic>-invaded communities. These findings also provide insights for the risk assessment of other aquatic invasive plants. The spread and establishment of many aquatic invasive plants may further accelerate under rapid global change (

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Capers et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). In the context of global warming and the northward shift of rain belts, the prediction and assessment of aquatic invasive plants will become more complicated at higher latitudes. Exploring the determinants and ecological effects of these aquatic invasive plants is crucial for predicting their dynamics in a changing environment and prioritizing biodiversity protection efforts.
