<p>Invasive plants usually exhibit greater phenotypic plasticity and photosynthetic abilities than accompanying native plants (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Godoy et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). In higher latitudes with relatively extreme environments, many invasive plants may show changes in their ecological and/or physiological traits in response to dramatic environmental changes (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Lacoul and Freedman, 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2017</xref>), as observed in 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> in our study. In general, increasing latitude decreases solar irradiance, temperature and precipitation (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Santamaría, 2002</xref>). Thus, as a thermophilous invasive plant native to the tropics, a higher 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> population density confers the advantage of capturing more solar energy in higher latitudes comparing with the native cooccurring plants, which could compensate for the energy loss caused by thermal fluctuations (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). An increase in stem carbon could improve individual toughness and tolerance to stresses by increasing the biosynthesis of lignins and polyphenols, because lignins depositing in secondary cell wall of stem tissues can improve the structural support and water transport in plant growth and development. Thus, in colder environments increasing lignins could increase stem hardness and then enhance plant tolerance (

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Polyphenols as important secondary chemicals responding to abiotic stresses may also be associated with invasive plant tolerance to low temperature (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, increasing carbon might facilitate the establishment and spread of 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> in stressed habitats in higher latitudes. Additionally, the obvious seasonal exchange of atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> in higher latitudes would also stimulate the carbon concentration of plant tissues (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Denning et al., 1995</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Marko et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Elser et al., 2010</xref>). The similar patterns of abundance and stem carbon varied along the latitudinal gradient have been observed in other aquatic invasive plants, such as 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> in China and 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> in Canada (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Cronin et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). As there was a significant negative co-varying relationship between latitude and temperature at large spatial scales, the response of 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> abundance to increasing temperature showed an opposite trend to that of the latitude gradient (
