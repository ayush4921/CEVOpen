<p>According to the latitudinal biotic interaction hypothesis (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Schemske et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Moles et al., 2011</xref>), plants may suffer more pressures from herbivores at lower latitudes. Thus, plants at low latitudes may develop high resistance to herbivores. This could explain the lower nitrogen contents in plant tissue in low latitudes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">
  <bold>Figures 2G, H</bold>
 </xref>), for reducing its palatability for herbivores (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Schemske et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Grutters et al., 2017</xref>). Some relevant studies also have shown that relative to the plants that grow under decreased annual mean temperature and precipitation in high latitudes, aquatic invasive plants in low latitudes are less nutritious (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Morrison and Hay, 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Cronin et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Petruzzella et al., 2017</xref>). The vigorous growth of aquatic invasive plants and the decomposition of their litter usually consume a large amount of dissolved oxygen, which greatly restricts native plant growth, while higher dissolved oxygen levels in water environments might benefit the restoration of the native plant community by alleviating competition for oxygen and, thus, decrease invasive plant competitiveness (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Sakurai et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Wu and Ding, 2019</xref>), explaining the decreasing height and plant cover of 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> with increasing dissolved oxygen levels. Conductivity is usually proportional to inorganic ion concentrations (e.g. Na
 <sup>+</sup>, Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>, Cl
 <sup>−</sup>); therefore, as a result of the salt-induced water deficit, plant height usually decreases with increased conductivity (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). However, many aquatic invasive plants exhibit high salt tolerance (such as 
 <italic>Myriophyllum spicatum</italic>, 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> and 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic>). Thus, increased water conductivity may stimulate vigorous compensatory growth, resulting in a greater plant height (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Thouvenot et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Chappuis et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Stoler et al., 2018</xref>). Nitrate nitrogen had no effect on 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> performance in this study, likely because 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> has a high nitrogen adsorption capacity (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">You et al., 2014</xref>), and our plots showed relatively high contents of nitrate nitrogen.
