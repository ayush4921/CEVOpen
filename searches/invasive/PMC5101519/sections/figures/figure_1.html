 <caption> Defoliation of pairs of A. philoxeroides vs. the total of the co-occurring native plants in the field surveys in 2013 ( a), 2014 ( b), and 2015 ( c), and the difference in defoliation between A. philoxeroides and the total co-occurring native plants in different seasons in 2013 ( d), 2014 ( e), and 2015 ( f). The sloping line in each figure represents the expected 50:50 distribution if the herbivores did not prefer A. philoxeroides over native plants. </caption>
