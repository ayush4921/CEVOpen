<p>In our study, the defoliation of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> increased significantly as the months progressed, which might be related to the abundance, richness and composition of the herbivores in the recipient communities because such parameters, especially in the insect community, fluctuated heavily in different months. In two previous studies in China, the abundance and richness of the insect species in temperate grasslands and wetlands increased from spring to autumn; the dominant species and dominancy index value were also different in different months
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. The defoliation trend of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> was consistent with the dynamics of the insect abundance and richness. Although the abundance and richness of insect species decreased in winter
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, the total number 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> leaves were also reduced in November due to shedding. Therefore, the defoliation of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> did not decrease in November.
