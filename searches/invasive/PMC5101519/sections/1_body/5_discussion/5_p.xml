<p>In conclusion, our study found that native herbivores prefer 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> to native plants because of its higher leaf N content; under pressure from the native herbivores, the aboveground performance and spread of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> was inhibited. Our study supported the biotic resistance hypothesis and confirmed that native herbivores could limit the spread of invasive plants. Furthermore, it suggested that native herbivores provide an important ecosystem service by helping to deter the invasion of exotic plants and reduce the adverse effects of invasive species. In addition, because native generalist herbivores prefer invasive plants to natives, the interactions among native herbivores and native plants will be altered, which is a valuable topic for further investigation.
