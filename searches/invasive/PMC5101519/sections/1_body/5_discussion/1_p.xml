<p>Our study supported the biotic resistance hypothesis; the majority of the herbivores in the recipient community preferred 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> to native plants, regardless of whether the dominant species was 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> or native plants. In the early seasons, the defoliation of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> was not higher than that of the total native plants. 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> originates from the tropical areas of South America, and Liangzihu Lake is located at the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the northern temperate zone; thus, the sprouting of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> in our field study occurred later than that of the early spring native plants (e.g., 
 <italic>Avena</italic>, 
 <italic>Alopecurus</italic>, 
 <italic>Poa</italic>, 
 <italic>Bromus</italic>, 
 <italic>Beckmannia</italic>, 
 <italic>Carex</italic>, 
 <italic>Elymus</italic>, 
 <italic>Lolium</italic>, etc.). Certain early spring plants had already lost considerable leaf mass through herbivore attacks at the time when 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> began sprouting. Thus, in certain communities in the early seasons, the defoliation of the total native plants was higher than the defoliation of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic>. In our study region, two beetles, 
 <italic>Galerucella grisescens</italic> and 
 <italic>Gastroghysa atrocyanea</italic>, appear to be Polygonaceae weed specialists, particularly those of the genera 
 <italic>Rumes</italic> and 
 <italic>Polygonum</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Therefore, the defoliation of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> was lower than that of Polygonaceae, but it was greater than that of the other native plants. This suggests that the invasive plants suffered lower herbivory pressure compared with the native plants that were eaten by specialist herbivores. If there are no specialist herbivores feeding on native plants in a recipient community, invasive plants will be subject to higher herbivory pressure than the natives.
