<p>Primary and secondary plant metabolites have been suggested to reduce the preference or performance of herbivores and determine the palatability of plants
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. However, Carmona 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> did not observe an overall association between the concentrations of secondary metabolites and herbivore susceptibility and suggested that genetic variation in the life-history traits of plants (e.g., flowering time, growth rate) was most strongly correlated with susceptibility to herbivores. Leaf N content is positively related to photosynthesis and relative growth rates
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, and leaf nutritional qualities may determine plant palatability. Nitrogen is scarce and perhaps a limiting nutrient for many herbivores, so herbivores prefer to feed on plants with higher N contents
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Studies have confirmed that leaf palatability is positively correlated with leaf N content
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, and this is consistent with the results of our study, which found that the leaf N content the leaf C/N ratio were positively and negatively correlated, respectively with plant defoliation. To attain a competitive advantage over native plants, successful invasive plants generally have higher leaf N contents than native plants, which improves their resource-use efficiency

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Consistent with previous studies, our study also found that the leaf N content of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> was higher than that of the other native plants, whereas the leaf C/N ratio of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> was lower than the native plants. These results suggested that the higher leaf N content contributed to the preference for 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> by native generalist herbivores.
