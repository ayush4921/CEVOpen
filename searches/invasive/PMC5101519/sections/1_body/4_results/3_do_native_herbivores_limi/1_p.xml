<p>In the natural-control treatment, the specialist beetle, 
 <italic>A. hygrophila</italic>, was absent, so only native herbivores influenced the defoliation and traits of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic>. The defoliation of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> increased over time. In June and July, the defoliation of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> was 5% and 2.87%, respectively, although the percentage increased to 12.14% in August. In the herbivore-excluded treatment, all of the leaves of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> were intact in the three surveys. After exposure to natural enemies for five months, the shoot biomass of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> in the natural-control treatment was significantly lower than that in the herbivore-excluded treatment (

 <sub>1,16</sub> = 4.129, P &lt; 0.05), while no differences in the root biomass and the total biomass of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> were observed between the two treatments (

 <sub>1,14</sub> = 0.21, P &gt; 0.05; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref> F
 <sub>1,16</sub> = 0.667, P &gt; 0.05). Although the number of shoots in the two treatments was similar (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>, F
 <sub>1,16</sub> = 0.042, P &gt; 0.05), the total length of the shoots in the natural-control treatment was lower than that in the herbivore-excluded treatment (

 <sub>1,16</sub> = 6.874, P &lt; 0.05).
