<p>The results of the three-year field experiments were highly consistent. In the early seasons (June 2013, May 2015, and July 2015), differences in defoliation were not observed between 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> and the total co-occurring native plants. However, in the later seasons (September 2013, August 2014, October 2014, September 2015, and November 2015), the defoliation of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> was significantly higher than that of the native plants, and this difference increased over time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d–f</xref>). The significant species × season interactions indicated that differences in the defoliation response to seasons varied among 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> and the total native plants (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Over time, the mean defoliation of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> increased significantly, whereas the mean defoliation of the total native plants was constant (
