<p>In total, 174 quadrats were surveyed over the three study years, and there were 55 quadrats in which the main species was 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic>; 79 quadrats in which the main species were native plants; and 40 quadrats in which the dominance of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> was equal to that of the native plants. In all three types of quadrats, the mean defoliation of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> was significantly higher than the mean defoliation of the native plants (

 <sub>8,309</sub> = 11.040, P &lt; 0.001). The mean defoliation of the native plant 
 <italic>Polygonum</italic> was higher than that of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic>, whereas the mean defoliation values of the other seven native plants with a high frequency of occurrence (
 <italic>Leersia hexandra</italic>, 
 <italic>Artemisia lavandulaefolia</italic>, 
 <italic>Hemarthria compressa</italic>, 
 <italic>Cynodon dactylon</italic>, 
 <italic>Paspalum paspaloides</italic>, 
 <italic>Carex</italic>, 
 <italic>Elymus sp</italic>.) were lower than that of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> (
