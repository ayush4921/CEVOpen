<p>The difference in the leaf N content among plant species was significant (F
 <sub>8,199</sub> = 21.036, P &lt; 0.001), and the leaf N content of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> was the highest among all of the evaluated species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). The leaf C/N ratio also differed significantly among plant species (F
 <sub>8,199</sub> = 18.046, P &lt; 0.001); the leaf C/N ratio of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> was the lowest of all of the species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Mean defoliation value was positively correlated with the mean leaf N content (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>, P = 0.035) but negatively correlated with the mean leaf C/N ratio (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>, P = 0.08).
