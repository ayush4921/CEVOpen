<p>We conducted field surveys on Liangzi Island (114°34′26″–114°35′22″ E, 30°16′13″–30°15′22″N) and Qingshan Island (30°16′44″–30 °15′44″E, 114°33′40″– 114°34′20″N), which are both in the centre of Liangzi Lake (a typical shallow lake in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River); the areas of the two islands are 2.2 km
 <sup>2</sup> and 1.0 km
 <sup>2</sup>, respectively. In the 1980s, 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> invaded this area, and it is now prevalent in grasslands, gardens, farms, ponds and lake littoral zones on both of the islands. On both islands, with the exception of 
 <italic>Agasicles hygrophila</italic> (the only specialist agent introduced to China for the biocontrol of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> from its original range), the native insects 
 <italic>Atractomorpha sinensis</italic>, the larvae of 
 <italic>Cassida nebulosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Hymenia recurvalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Pieris rapae</italic> as well as some aphids and spiders feed on 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic>.
