<p>The stem weight of each plant was also determined after drying at 70 °C for 72 h to calculate the shoot biomass of each plant and the total aboveground biomass in the entire quadrat. To identify whether species dominance can affect the preference of herbivores for 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> and the native plants, we divided all 174 quadrats from the 8 surveys into three types: (1) communities in which the main species was 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> (the aboveground biomass of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> constituted more than 60% of the total aboveground biomass of the entire quadrat); (2) communities in which the main species were native plants (the aboveground biomass of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> constituted less than 40% of total aboveground biomass of the entire quadrat); (3) communities in which the abundance of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> was equal to the native plants (the aboveground biomass of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> constituted 40–60% of the total aboveground biomass of the entire quadrat).
