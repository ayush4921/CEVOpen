<p>In the four surveys in 2015, 8 native plants (
 <italic>Polygonum</italic>, 
 <italic>Leersia hexandra, Artemisia lavandulaefolia</italic>, 
 <italic>Hemarthria compressa</italic>, 
 <italic>Cynodon dactylon</italic>, 
 <italic>Paspalum paspaloides</italic>, 
 <italic>Carex sp</italic>., 
 <italic>Elymus sp</italic>.) were high-frequency species (present in more than 16 of the 97 total quadrats). The leaf N and C contents in the undamaged, intact leaves of these plants were measured with a C/N analyzer (FLASH 2000, Thermo, USA). If there were more than 30 samples from one individual plant, 30â€“40 samples were randomly selected to measure the leaf N and C contents, and if there were less than 30 samples, the leaf N and C contents of all of the samples were measured. At least 16 samples from each plant were measured for a total of 208 samples.
