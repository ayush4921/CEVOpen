<p>We conducted 8 field surveys over the following months: June and September 2013, August and October 2014, and May, July, September and November 2015. In each survey, communities consisting of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> and native plants were randomly selected, but communities in which 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> was damaged by 
 <italic>A. hygrophila</italic> were excluded. Then, the defoliation of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> and the co-occurring native plants was determined in 100 × 100-cm
 <sup>2</sup> or 50 × 50-cm
 <sup>2</sup> quadrats, depending on the sizes of the communities (100 × 100-cm
 <sup>2</sup> quadrats were established in large communities, and 50 × 50-cm
 <sup>2</sup> quadrats were placed in small communities). In each quadrat, we checked each of the damaged leaves on one plant and scored them on a nine-degree scale: 1 (full leaf was damaged), 3/4 (most parts of the leaf were damaged), 1/2 (half of one leaf was damaged), 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 1/64, and 1/128. The number of removed leaves (
 <italic>Nr</italic>) was calculated as the sum of the damaged leaf scores, and we used two methods to assess the defoliation (% leaf area removed) of each plant (
 <italic>Rd</italic>). If the abundance of the plant was low, the following calculation was used:
