<p>To test our first hypothesis, we evaluated whether 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> suffered higher levels of defoliation than the co-occurring native plants. In the field surveys, after testing for normality and homoscedasticity, two-way ANOVAS with species (
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> or native plants), season (different months in one year) and their interaction as fixed factors were employed to analyze the differences in defoliation between 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> and the total of the co-occurring native plants in the different seasons within each year. Duncan’s tests were then used to compare the levels within factors to determine significance (P &lt; 0.05), and the differences in defoliation between 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> and the total of the co-occurring native plants in the three types of communities were analyzed using paired t-tests. To evaluate whether exotic plants have higher levels of N or lower leaf C/N ratios, a one-way ANOVA of the differences in the leaf N contents and leaf C/N ratios of these plants was employed, and Duncan’s tests were used to compare the levels within the factors for significance (P &lt; 0.05). To analyze whether the higher leaf N content in plants is a contributing factor to higher defoliation, a linear regression analysis was used to determine the relationships between mean defoliation and mean leaf N content, and mean leaf C/N ratios; however, the native plant 
 <italic>Polygonum</italic> was excluded from these analyses because 
 <italic>Polygonum</italic> plants were eaten by specialist herbivores in the field surveys.
