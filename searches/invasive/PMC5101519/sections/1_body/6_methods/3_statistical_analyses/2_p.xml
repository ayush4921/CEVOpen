<p>To evaluate the effects of herbivory on the 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> populations, we used paired t-tests to analyze the differences in shoot number, total shoot length, shoot biomass, root biomass and the total biomass of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> between the herbivore-excluded and natural-control treatments in the herbivore exclosure experiment. All of the analyses were performed using SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
