<p>Novel host-enemy interactions are vital mechanisms that explain the success or failure of exotic plants and mediate the dynamics of invasions in new ranges
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Two prominent hypotheses (the enemy release hypothesis and the biotic resistance hypothesis) have been put forward based on these interactions. The enemy release hypothesis proposes that the success of exotic plants is related to their liberation from their specialist herbivores and pathogens and that the enemies in the recipient regions have a greater impact on native plants than exotic plants
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Furthermore, when herbivores are absent in the recipient regions, selection will favour genotypes with increased competitive abilities and reduced resource allocation to herbivore defence, so the invasive plants will exhibit faster growth rates and larger sizes (Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability Hypothesis, EICA)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. In contrast, the biotic resistance hypothesis proposes that natural enemies in the invaded communities will limit the success of exotic plants because exotic plants usually lack effective defences against native enemies with which they do not share an evolutionary history
