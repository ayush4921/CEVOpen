<p>Many studies have examined the novel host-enemy interactions in invaded ranges, but the results have been inconsistent
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Studies have found that exotic plants suffer less herbivory than native plants in the recipient communities and that native generalist consumers prefer native over exotic plants

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> because the defences employed by the invasive plants are uncommon or absent from the recipient range. Therefore, native generalist herbivores may be deterred or lack a detoxification mechanism
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. These studies are consistent with the enemy release hypothesis. However, other studies have shown that native herbivores prefer exotic plants over native plants
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> because the capability of the exotic plants to express induced resistance to the native herbivores is lower than that of the natives
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. The tolerance of exotic plants to damage by native herbivores is also weaker than in natives
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, so native herbivores can limit exotic plant populations
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. These studies support the biotic resistance hypothesis. However, only a few herbivore species have been studied to test the two hypotheses in these study systems, and the preferences of different herbivores for native vs. exotic plants vary, which might have contributed to the inconsistent results. For example, in a study that tested the preferences of aquatic generalist herbivores for exotic or native macrophytes, a native crayfish preferred exotics over natives
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. In contrast, other studies found that a native snail preferred native over exotic macrophytes, and the larvae of a native moth showed no preference for either native or exotic macrophytes
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Therefore, it is necessary to synthetically evaluate the damage from herbivores to exotic and native plants in recipient communities. Even in field surveys in which the plants suffer attacks from all of the herbivores in the recipient community, a dynamic survey over different seasons is still required because the abundance, richness, and activities of the herbivores vary across seasons
