<p>High leaf nitrogen (N) concentration is thought to confer increased competitiveness because it contributes to a high photosynthetic ability and a relatively high growth rate
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Invasive plants are often characterized as having high leaf N contents and high relative growth rates

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, but plants with leaves that present high N concentrations are also at risk of preferential consumption by herbivores
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Lower nutritive quality has been suggested as an anti-herbivore strategy for plants because low N and water contents have been associated with reduced insect preference and performance
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Studies have found that leaf palatability is positively correlated with leaf N content and water content and negatively correlated with the leaf carbon (C) content and the C/N ratio
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Therefore, invasive plants may be preferentially eaten by native herbivores if they have higher leaf N concentrations compared with the native plants.
