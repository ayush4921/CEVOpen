 <italic>Alternanthera philoxeroides</italic> (Martius) Grisebach (Amaranthaceae) is a perennial herbaceous plant that is both stoloniferous and amphibious. The native range of this species is thought to be the Parana River region of southern Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Currently, 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> has invaded the USA, China, Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, India, and Thailand. In invaded areas, 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> decreases the biomass of native plant species, alters patterns of nutrient cycling, and blocks drainage and irrigation canals, causing economic and ecological problems
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. In China, 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> was first introduced into suburban Shanghai from Japan as a forage crop in the late 1930s, and it has now invaded large areas south of the Yellow River Basin and can be found sporadically in northern China. 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> has been listed as one of the 12 most harmful alien, invasive species in China
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. In China, more than fifteen generalist insects feed on 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic>

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, but there are no reports in the literature discussing the preference of these generalist insects for this invasive species versus native plants or evaluating the effects of native herbivores. In this study, we surveyed the defoliation of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> and co-occurring native plants on two islands in different seasons over three consecutive years and measured the leaf N and C contents of the high-frequency plants. Furthermore, an herbivore exclosure experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of native herbivores on populations of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic>. We attempted to test three hypotheses: (i) the invasive plant 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> will suffer more herbivory damage than the co-occurring native plants in invaded communities, and species dominance will affect the preference of the herbivores for 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> vs. the native plants; (ii) 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> will present higher leaf N concentrations or a lower leaf C/N ratio than the native plants, which will be a contributing factor to its higher defoliation; and (iii) native herbivores will limit the populations of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic>. This study contributes to a better understanding of how native herbivores can drive the success of exotic plant species in their new ranges.
