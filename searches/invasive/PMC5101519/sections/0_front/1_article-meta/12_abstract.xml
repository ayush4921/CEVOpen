 <p>Host-enemy interactions are vital mechanisms that explain the success or failure of invasive plants in new ranges. We surveyed the defoliation of invasive 
  <italic>Alternanthera philoxeroides</italic> and co-occurring native plants on two islands during different seasons over three consecutive years and measured the leaf nitrogen content and the C/N ratio of each plant species. To evaluate the effects of herbivory on 
  <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic>, an herbivore exclosure experiment was conducted. We found that the mean defoliation of 
  <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> was higher than that of native plants, regardless of whether the dominant species was 
  <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> or native plants. 
  <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> defoliation increased significantly as the months progressed, whereas the defoliation of the total population of native plants was constant. The leaf nitrogen content was positively correlated with defoliation, and it was highest in 
  <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic>. Additionally, 
  <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> in the herbivore exclusion treatment showed an increase in shoot biomass and total shoot length. Our study revealed that native generalist herbivores prefer the invasive plant to the natives because of the higher leaf nitrogen content. These results support the biotic resistance hypothesis, suggesting that native herbivore species can limit the population spread of invasive plants.
