 <italic>Tithonia diversifolia</italic> (Hemsl.) A. Gray (Asteraceae), commonly known as Mexican sunflower, is a perennial herb or shrub. It is native to Mexico and Central America and has been introduced into many countries in Asia, Africa, and the Pacific islands (

 <italic>T. diversifolia</italic> was first recorded in southern Yunnan Province in 1936; it is now found in 53 counties of Yunnan and is expanding rapidly in southern China (

 <italic>Tithonia diversifolia</italic> was originally cultivated as an ornamental plant or green manure in villages and farms, but subsequently escaped and invaded into diverse habitats. As a pioneering species, 
 <italic>T. diversifolia</italic> can produce numerous seeds and form dense stands, which suppress the growth of native species significantly and pose a great threat to biodiversity (
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">CABI, 2016</xref>). Intersimple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers have been developed to assess genetic diversity in 
 <italic>T. diversifolia</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2012</xref>), but dominant markers like ISSRs are less powerful in genetic and evolutionary studies. Here, expressed sequence tagâ€“simple sequence repeat (EST-SSR) markers were isolated and characterized. These markers will be useful for genetic and evolutionary studies, providing important information (e.g., mating system, invasion routes) for better management of
