<p>We first randomly selected 130 primer pairs amplifying SSRs containing dinucleotide or trinucleotide motifs. The primers were tested in eight individuals of 
 <italic>T. diversifolia</italic> collected from Yuxi (herbarium ID YNU-YX106), Lincang (herbarium ID YNU-LC011), and Jingxi (herbarium ID YNU-JX004) as preparatory screening. Primers that produced reproducible and clearly defined bands were further tested for polymorphism in three populations (48 individuals in total) from southern China (

 <sup>2+</sup> plus), 0.4 μL MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.4 μL dNTPs (2.5 mM), 0.2 μL of each primer (50 μM), and 1 unit 
 <italic>Taq</italic> polymerase (TaKaRa Biotechnology Co., Dalian, China). The PCR program for amplification of all loci consisted of an initial denaturation at 94°C for 4 min, followed by 27 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 45 s, annealing at specific temperature for 45 s (
