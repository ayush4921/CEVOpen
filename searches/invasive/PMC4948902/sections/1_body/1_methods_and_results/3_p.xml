<p>In total, 16 primer pairs successfully amplified products with expected sizes and showed clearly defined polymorphic banding patterns. The primer sequences, repeat motifs, allele ranges, and annealing temperatures are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. The number of alleles per locus (
 <italic>A</italic>) and the observed and expected heterozygosities (
 <italic>H</italic>
 <sub>o</sub> and 
 <italic>H</italic>
 <sub>e</sub>) were calculated across the three populations using GenAlEx 6.5 (
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Peakall and Smouse, 2012</xref>). The number of alleles per locus varied from two to four alleles. One locus (Cl42) was monomorphic in two populations, but polymorphic in another population. At the population level, 
 <italic>H</italic>
 <sub>o</sub> and 
 <italic>H</italic>
 <sub>e</sub> ranged from 0.000 to 0.824 and from 0.000 to 0.643, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). For 12 of the 16 loci, significant departures from Hardyâ€“Weinberg equilibrium were detected in population LC or YX. This may result from nonrandom mating in the expanding populations. However, this pattern was not found in population GX, which may be due to the relatively small sample size (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10) or other unknown reasons. To evaluate the potential utility of the newly developed markers in other phylogenetically related species, cross-amplification experiments were performed in six individuals each of 
 <italic>T. rotundifolia</italic> (Mill.) S. F. Blake and 
 <italic>Parthenium hysterophorus</italic> L. The results are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>. Among the 16 markers from 
 <italic>T. diversifolia</italic>, 12 could be cross-amplified in the congeneric 
 <italic>T. rotundifolia</italic> and five could be cross-amplified in the more distantly related 
 <italic>P. hysterophorus</italic>, another invasive species in tribe Heliantheae Cass.
