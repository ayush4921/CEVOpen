<p>Dandelion seeds were removed at a rate of approximately 2–4% per day in both South Dakota and the Czech Republic. In South Dakota, seeds were removed from the seed dishes at an overall rate of 0.94 ± 0.11 seeds per dish (3.76% of the seeds; mean ± SEM) on each day of the 7-day observation period. Seeds were removed at a rate of 0.57 ± 0.15 seeds (2.28% of the seeds) over the 1 day exposure period in the Czech Republic. In South Dakota, these rates varied substantially among the observation periods (Dates in 2009:
