<p>Gut analysis revealed a high consumption rate of marked dandelion seeds under field conditions. 21.85 ± 3.74% of specimens were positive per plot (pooled across sample dates) for the seed marker in South Dakota. Both sample date and the duration between putting the seeds in the field and when the granivores were collected had significant effects on the proportion of specimens testing positive (sample period:

However, there were no significant effects of sample period or the duration since seed deposition on the proportion of granivores testing positive for the seed marker in the Czech Republic (sample period:
