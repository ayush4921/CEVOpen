<p>In the Czech Republic, the partial least squares regression analysis revealed significant relationships between the numbers of some taxa positive and seed removal rates per plot (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Cumulative variation explained for predictors was 100%, and cumulative variation explained for the responses was 10.41%. The numbers of 
 <italic>Philoscia muscorum</italic> and 
 <italic>Barypeithes pullucidus</italic> positive for the seed marker were significantly associated with seed removal (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Pearson correlation analysis did not confirm the significant relationship of 
 <italic>B. pullucidus</italic> with seed removal, but did support the interaction of the number of 
 <italic>P. muscorum</italic> positive for the seed marker and dandelion seed removal. Of the other Carabidae collected in the Czech Republic that are not included in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, only one 
 <italic>A. aenea</italic> tested positive for the seed marker. There was one 
 <italic>T. rathkei</italic> that tested positive for the seed marker, and none of the 
 <italic>L. niger</italic> tested positive for the marker.
