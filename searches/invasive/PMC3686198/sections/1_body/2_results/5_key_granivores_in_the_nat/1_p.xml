<p>In South Dakota, the partial least squares regression analysis revealed a strong relationship between certain members of the community and seed removal ratios per plot (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Cumulative variation explained for predictors was 100%, and cumulative variation explained for the responses was 5.11%. Number positive of 
 <italic>Anisodactylus rusticus</italic> was significantly negatively correlated with seed removal rate and numbers of positive Staphylinidae and 
 <italic>Harpalus compar</italic> were significantly positively correlated with seed removal (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Simple Pearson correlation analysis confirmed the relationships between Staphylinidae and 
 <italic>H. compar</italic> with seed removal rates but the relationship with 
 <italic>A. rusticus</italic> was not corroborated. The Pearson correlation analysis added a significant correlation between numbers positive of 
 <italic>Lasius neoniger</italic> and seed removal rates (Pearson correlation coefficient = −0.31; Bartlett 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 4.76, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.03; a negative correlation) with seed removal that was not revealed by the partial least squares regression. For infrequently collected families not included in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, the mean (SEM) percent positives for the seed marker per plot were: other grasshoppers (20.00 ± 12.25% positive), other crickets (30.16 ± 18.10), other camel crickets (50.00 ± 50.00), 
 <italic>Orius insidiosus</italic> (no positive), 
 <italic>Otiorhynchus ovatus</italic> (33.33 ± 33.33), other beetles (14.58 ± 9.68), other caterpillars (21.11 ± 11.84), and other ants (15.56 ± 10.42).
