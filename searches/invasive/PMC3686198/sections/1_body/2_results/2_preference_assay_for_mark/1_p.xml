<p>The process used to mark the seeds had important implications for whether marked seeds were preferred over unmarked seeds. When the filtration method was used to mark seeds, both the marked and unmarked seeds were consumed equally by crickets (
 <italic>G. pennsylvanicus</italic>, standardized by insect size) after 48 h in the laboratory (paired 
 <italic>t</italic>-test, 
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>49</sub> = 0.94, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.34). Mean (SEM) consumption rates were 41.36 ± 3.68 and 40.30 ± 3.69 seeds per 48 h for marked and unmarked seeds, respectively. This was the method used in South Dakota. The same pattern was not found for the lyophilized seeds used in the Czech Republic. Three of the five ground beetle species strongly preferred the lyophilized seeds (that were imbibed for 24 h) over the untreated seeds after 48 h.

 <sub>19</sub> = −5.22,

 <sub>19</sub> = −1.39, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.19; 4.50 ± 1.01 and 6.60 ± 0.93 seeds), which consumed similar numbers of seeds over 48 h. In an extended observation, both of these latter species significantly preferred marked seeds when the total number of seeds consumed over 3 days was compared (
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>19</sub> = −2.64, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.02). When 
 <italic>A. aenea</italic> was offered unmarked seeds either lyophilized (and imbibed for 24 h) or not, they did not have a preference over 2 days(
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>19</sub> = −1.17, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.26), but preferred the lyophilized seeds after 3 days(
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>19</sub> = −2.55, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.02); these results were almost identical to those observed for the protein-marked, lyophilized and un-lyophilized, unmarked seeds. Of these Czech Republic ground beetles used in the preference study, only 
 <italic>A. aenea</italic> was found to have consumed dandelion seeds in the field plots (see below).
