<p>Post-dispersal granivory (i.e., granivory that occurs after the seeds leave the parent plant) affects the density and dispersion of plants within a habitat (Lundgren 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">2009</xref>). Daily seed removal rates of plants can be quite extensive (O'Rourke et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">2006</xref>; Menalled et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">2007</xref>), but are typically &lt; 10% in most systems (Lundgren 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">2009</xref>). This species-rich community is typically regarded as being dominated by rodents (Hulme 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">2002</xref>; Westerman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">2003a</xref>), carabid beetles (Lundgren 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">2009</xref>), crickets (O'Rourke et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">2006</xref>; Lundgren and Harwood 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">2012</xref>), and ants (MacMahon et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">2000</xref>; Nicolai and Boeken 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">2012</xref>), but the community is dynamic in space and time which makes it difficult to generalize as to constituency in a particular habitat. Furthermore, each taxon within the community has preferences for certain seed characteristics such as seed size, defensive properties, seed coat strength, and chemical and nutritional attributes (Pizo and Oliveira 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">2001</xref>; HonÄ›k et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">2003</xref>; Lundgren and Rosentrater 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">2007</xref>). These preferences change in response to various physiological and environmental circumstances (Lundgren 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">2009</xref>). These preferences ultimately drive which species are consumed within a habitat.
