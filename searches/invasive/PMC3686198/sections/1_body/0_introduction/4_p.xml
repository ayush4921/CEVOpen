<p>One problem with our understanding of how enemies of invasive species respond to invasive and weedy plants is that only a small number of studies have explicitly examined the enemy community in both the native and recipient regions (Liu and Stiling 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">2006</xref>). This research aims to advance technology (protein marking of seeds and gut analysis of putative predators, sensu Hagler 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">2006</xref>) to definitively describe the relative trophic linkages of dandelion seeds to the granivore communities in its native range (Czech Republic) and a recipient biota (South Dakota).
