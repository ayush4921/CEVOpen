<p>Dandelion (
 <italic>Taraxacum officinale</italic> agg.; Asteraceae) is a perennial plant that is native to Eurasia and has invaded much of the rest of the world over the past 100–150 years (Stewart-Wade et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2002</xref>). In North America, dandelions are cosmopolitan in most landscapes with spring moisture, including perennial agroecosystems and no-till cropland, where this species has become a readily recognizable pest (Johnson and Larson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">2007</xref>). In addition to competing with natives for light and space, the plant can compete for pollinator services with native flowers and possibly hybridize with native congeners (Kandori et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">2009</xref>; Matsumoto et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">2010</xref>; but see Jones 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">2004</xref>). Research on dandelions in the Old World has advanced our understanding of seed demography and ecology in plants, and the constraints that limit granivory on a target plant species (Brock et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">2005</xref>; Honěk et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">2008</xref>; Martinková et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">2009</xref>). The post-dispersal granivore community in North America is entirely undescribed.
