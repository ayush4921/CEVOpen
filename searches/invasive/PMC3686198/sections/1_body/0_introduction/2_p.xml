<p>Research on granivory as a form of weed management has emphasized identifying the impact of granivores on a seed resource rather than on identifying which granivores have strong trophic linkages to a particular seed. Many studies examine the numerical associations of specific granivore taxa with seed removal rates (Davis and Liebman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">2003</xref>; O'Rourke et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">2006</xref>; Saska et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">2008</xref>; Bohan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2011</xref>). Some studies reinforce these numerical correlations by restricting arthropod access to sentinel seed patches based on granivore size or seasonal phenology (Menalled et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">2000</xref>; Baraibar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">2012</xref>), or by confirming consumption rates using laboratory assays that demonstrate that specific granivores consume a particular seed (HonÄ›k et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">2003</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">2005</xref>; Saska 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">2008b</xref>b). These techniques are helpful in establishing the intensity of seed consumption and in narrowing the number of potentially important members of the granivore community. However, these techniques disrupt the normal behaviors of granivores, and therefore the relative strengths of trophic interactions between specific members of the granivore community remain elusive. One approach frequently used to establish trophic connections of animals to specific foods has been gut or fecal analysis that searches for a food-associated, often molecular, marker; this is particularly well studied for insect predators (Sheppard and Harwood 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">2005</xref>; Weber and Lundgren 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">2009</xref>). Surprisingly, little attention has been given to using this technique to examine the granivore community associated with specific plant species. An exception is in examining the diets of birds (Legagneux et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">2007</xref>) and seed caches of rodents (Li and Zhang 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">2007</xref>), where scat analysis, forced regurgitation, microscopic gut analysis, and marking the seeds with a fluorescent or radioactive dust can establish trophic links to seeds with limited disruption of the normal feeding behavior of the granivore. Still, molecular gut analysis (searching for nucleic acids or proteins; the predominant methods used in insect predation studies) remains relatively undeveloped with respect to granivory.
