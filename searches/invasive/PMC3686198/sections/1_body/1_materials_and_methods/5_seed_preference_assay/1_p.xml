<p>Preferences for marked and unmarked seeds were assayed using seeds marked with the two different marking strategies (see above). In the Czech Republic, 
 <italic>Amara aenea</italic>, 
 <italic>A. similata</italic>, 
 <italic>Harpalus affinis</italic>, 
 <italic>H. luteicornis</italic>, 
 <italic>H. rufipes</italic> (Coleoptera: Carabidae) were all offered marked-lyophilized seeds. In the first set of experiments, 20 individual 
 <italic>A. aenea</italic>, 
 <italic>A. similata,</italic> and 
 <italic>H. luteicornis</italic> were offered 15 untreated (control) and 15 treated (marked lyophilized) seeds mounted on plasticine trays (tin trays filled with white plasticine JOVI® (JOVI, Barcelona, Spain), in which seeds were half stuck so that they can be easily acquired by the arthropods; Honěk et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">2003</xref>). 
 <italic>Harpalus affinis</italic> and 
 <italic>H. rufipes</italic> were offered 30 seeds of each type due to larger body size. Trays with seeds were inspected daily and replaced if more than 50% of seeds were eaten. In a separate assay, we examined the preference of 
 <italic>A. aenea</italic> for untreated versus lyophilized but unmarked seeds, using the methodology described above. In South Dakota, we used similar methods to examine the preference of 50 
 <italic>Gryllus pennsylvanicus</italic> (Orthoptera: Gryllidae) for seeds marked with the filtration method versus unmarked seeds. Each cricket received 75 of each type of seed, which were affixed to the base of the Petri dish arenas using double-sided tape (fine sand was placed over the exposed taped area). In all assays, seed consumption was recorded after 2 days.
