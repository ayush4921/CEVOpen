<p>Research was conducted in both the recipient biota (South Dakota) and the donor biotia (Czech Republic) of dandelion. In South Dakota (SD), research was conducted in 2009 and 2010 on the Eastern South Dakota Soil and Water Research Farm (44.353011, −96.799648; latitude, longitude) near Brookings, South Dakota. In the Czech Republic, research was conducted at the Crop Research Institute (50.511377, 14.188966) near Prague only in 2009 (efforts to capture insects failed in 2010). These regions have similar average high and low daily air temperatures in May and June (May average high 18.7–21.0°C, average low 7.0–8.4°C; June average high 22.0–26.0°C, average low 11.2–12.0°C) and precipitation levels (a monthly average of 73–107 mm in May and June). At both locations, the habitats were perennial orchards with mowed perennial ground cover (one site in the Czech Republic remained unmowed) with edge habitats that varied from tree lines to open meadows. Each had high densities of dandelions. In the Czech Republic, dandelions were abundant at all sites, but were not quantified. In South Dakota, mean (±SEM) densities of plants were 172 ± 20 and 330 ± 33 dandelions per m
 <sup>2</sup> in 2009 and 2010, respectively. There were three replicate sites (each 100 m
 <sup>2</sup>; 10 × 10 m) in the Czech Republic that were separated by 150–300 m. Five replicate sites of the same size were selected in South Dakota, and these were at least 30 m apart.
