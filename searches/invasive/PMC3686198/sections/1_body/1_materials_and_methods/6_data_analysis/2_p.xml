<p>A rarefaction analysis was conducted to estimate the granivore accumulation curves in the native and the recipient biota of dandelion. The abundances of positive specimens in each granivore species were used to calculate this curve (Analytic Rarefaction 1.3). A Chao 1 estimator was calculated for each plot, and resulting mean diversities (S) per plot were used as a further measure of species diversity in the two study locations (Chao
