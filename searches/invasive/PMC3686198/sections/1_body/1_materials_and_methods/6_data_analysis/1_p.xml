<p>Partial least squares regression analyses were used to determine which taxa (percent positive) were significantly correlated with seed removal for each plot and on each sample period. Separate analyses were used for the recipient (South Dakota) and native (Czech Republic) biota. Taxa included in the model were those that represented &gt;1% of the specimens collected and had at least one individual that tested positive for the seed marker. The residuals were examined and revealed normal distributions. To offer further support for the results of the multiple regression analysis, simple Pearson correlation tests between percent positive of each taxon and seed removal were conducted using the Bartlett chi chi-squared test statistic.</p>
