<p>The ability to detect the protein marker on the seeds over time was evaluated by exposing small satchels of marked seeds to the environment. Seed satchels consisted of IgG-marked seeds (25 g) in a coarse muslin material folded in half. Five satchels were affixed to the soil in each plot with a small metal stake. Satchels were recovered 0, 2, 5, 7, and 9 days after placement, and were held at −20°C until processing. To remove the marker, three subsamples of five seeds from each satchel were placed into individual 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes containing 500 μL of 1 × PBS. These subsamples were incubated at 10°C for 24 h. Each of these subsamples was analyzed using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) procedures outlined below.</p>
