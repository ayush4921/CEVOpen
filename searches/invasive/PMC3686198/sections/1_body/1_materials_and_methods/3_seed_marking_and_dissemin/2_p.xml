<p>General seed removal rates of unmarked dandelion seeds were monitored using sentinel seed patches (each with 25 seeds) in each plot. In South Dakota, intact dandelion seeds were affixed to the bases of each of 125 plastic Petri dishes (10 cm diam) using double-sided tape. Fine quartz sand was placed around the seed to prevent insects from adhering to the tape. On the first day of each sample period, five dishes were placed on the soil surface in a centralized × pattern in each plot, and residue from surrounding soil was placed lightly over the tops. Seed dishes were recollected after 7 days (exceeding the pitfall trapping period, but not overlapping observation periods). In the Czech Republic, arthropod activity was monitored using seed cards (sand paper strips 3 × 8 cm, seeds per card glued with 3M® repositionable glue; Westerman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">2003b</xref>). Five cards per site were held in place with nails and were exposed for 1 day following the deposition of marked seeds. The mean numbers of seeds removed or damaged per sentinel station were counted for each plot and observation period.
