<p>Insects were thawed and surface sterilized for at least 30 sec in 70% ethanol. When possible, the stomachs were dissected from specimens longer than 1 cm to reduce excess tissues in the sample that may interfere in the analysis. All specimens (or their stomachs) were macerated in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube filled with 300 μL of 1 × PBS using a sterile, plastic pestle. The specimens were vortexed, solids were centrifuged out over 3 min at 16,100 rcf, and samples were subjected to double-antibody sandwich ELISA. Every other row of 96-well plates (Product number 12-565-501, Fisher Scientific, Denver, CO) were coated with 100 μL of primary antibody (1:500 anti-Rabbit IgG from goat; R-2004, Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS, and incubated for 24 h at 4°C (the other rows were coated with 100 μL of PBS). All subsequent steps were incubated at 23°C. Primary antibody was ejected, each well of the plate was blocked with 360 μL of 1% milk (w/v), and incubated for 30 min. The milk was ejected, and the plate was washed three times with PBS-Tween (PBST; Tween® 20, Product number P1379, Sigma-Aldrich). Each sample (100 μL) was loaded into two wells on a plate, one coated with primary antibody and one coated with PBS. The samples were then incubated for 1 h. Samples were ejected, and the plate was washed three times with PBST. Secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG from goat conjugated with horseradish peroxidase; 100 μL in each well; diluted to 1:1000 in 1% milk; Product A-6154, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each well, and the plate was incubated for 1 h. The secondary antibody was ejected, and the plate washed three times with PBST. TMB solution was added to each well (100 μL), and after incubating for 15 min, the optical density (OD) was read at 630 nm (μQuant, Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT). On each plate, two 8-well control series accompanied the samples, one with PBS in place of the samples (negative control), and one with Rabbit IgG diluted to 1:500 in place of the samples (positive control). A sample was considered positive if the OD generated in the well that received primary antibody and a given sample exceeded the OD generated in the well that received the sample and PBS (in lieu of the primary antibody) by 2.5 times the standard deviation of the 8-well negative control series (Sutula et al.
