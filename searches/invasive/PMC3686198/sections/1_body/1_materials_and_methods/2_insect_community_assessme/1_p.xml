<p>In the center of each plot (5 × 5 m), two sets of barrier-linked pitfall traps were placed perpendicular to one another, each occurring centrally in one half of the plot. Barrier-linked pitfall traps amplify trap captures over individual pitfalls; in our study, these consisted of two dry pitfall traps (10 cm diameter opening), spaced 1.5 m apart that were connected using a metal sheet (150.0 × 14.5 cm long × tall) held vertically to direct foraging arthropods into the traps at either end (Lundgren et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">2009</xref>). Traps were activated by placing a glass collection jar with a 1 × 1 cm piece of material impregnated with insecticide (Dichlorvos, 2, 2-Dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate 18.6%; Prozap; Loveland Industries Inc., Greeley, CO). In the Czech Republic, four single traps per site were added to increase the catch size. These traps consisted of two nested plastic cups (opening diameter 7 cm, volume 300 ml, covered with a metal roof to avoid flooding), and each contained insecticide.
