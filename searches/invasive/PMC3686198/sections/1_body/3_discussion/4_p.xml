<p>Gut content analysis of pitfall-collected arthropods did not consistently correlate with seed removal rates. Of the top five strongest trophic linkages between dandelion seeds and granivores in the recipient and native granivore communities, only the isopod 
 <italic>Philoscia muscorum</italic> was positively correlated with seed removal rates (in the Czech Republic). One potential explanation for the disconnect between strong trophic linkages revealed by gut analysis and the impact that these taxa had on seed removal rates was that our sampling scheme (pitfall trapping) did not reflect the actual densities of these taxa (Topping and Sunderland 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">1992</xref>; Lang 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">2000</xref>). An abundant arthropod taxon with a weak trophic link to dandelion seed could conceivably have a greater impact on seed removal than a rare taxon with a strong trophic link. Some have demonstrated strong correlations of seed removal with particular granivore taxa using pitfall trapping (Davis and Liebman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">2003</xref>), while others have not (Saska et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">2008</xref>). Regardless, obtaining actual densities of the now recognized diverse granivore community would add to our understanding on the relative contributions of these taxa to seed removal.
