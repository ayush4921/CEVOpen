<p>This study reveals a more taxonomically diverse post-dispersal granivore community than has ever been described before. The use of gut analysis to establish trophic linkages to a particular seed substantiates that commonly identified granivores such as ants, carabids, and crickets are important granivores, but expands the list to include certain species of caterpillars, weevils, and rove beetles, which have largely been ignored previously. The study also suggests that isopods and millipedes are important seed consumers in both the recipient and native biota (as was seen by Saska 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b101">2008a</xref>; Koprdová et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b100">2010</xref>). This study suggests that some “carnivorous” species (e.g., 
 <italic>Bembidion quadrimaculatum</italic>, 
 <italic>Cyclotrachelus alternans, Elaphropus</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Poecilus lucublandus</italic>, 
 <italic>Poecilus versicolor</italic>, and 
 <italic>Pterostichus permundus</italic>) are more polyphagous than was believed (our experience with gut analysis leads us to believe that it is unlikely that these predators ate a granivore that just consumed a marked seed), and has important implications on where these species fit within food webs.
