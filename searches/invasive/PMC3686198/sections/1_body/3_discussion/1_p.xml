<p>This study reveals a much more diverse community of granivores than was previously realized for seeds, provides new tools for studying applied and basic questions regarding post-dispersal granivory, and suggests that granivores are fully adapted to dandelion seed resources in the recipient range. Pairing gut content analysis of arthropods with protein-marking of seeds revealed a much more diverse community of post-dispersal granivores than has previously been predicted for a single seed species. Linkage strength of particular granivores did not always correlate well with seed removal rates, potentially due to the fact that relative densities of these taxa were not well measured by pitfall traps. The method of seed marking thus has merit as a tool used in conjunction with other methods (e.g., seed removal, laboratory feeding trials, etc.) to help resolve which species are potentially important granivores of plants.</p>
