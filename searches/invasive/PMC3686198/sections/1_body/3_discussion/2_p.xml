<p>Many members of the diverse communities of post-dispersal granivores are polyphagous, consuming other foods in addition to a given seed species. The percentage of the overall communities that tested positive for the marker was very similar in the two regions (around 22% of granivores tested positive), but apparently this granivory was inflicted by a more diverse community in the recipient biota (although sampling intensities varied between the sites). This is in spite of lyophilizing the seeds in the Czech Republic range, which may have increased their attraction to granivores. Many of the taxa that consumed marked dandelion seeds are polyphagous omnivores, some of which are likely food limited, and may switch or expand their diets in response to local resource availability like local seed rain (Frank et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">2011</xref>; Lundgren and Harwood 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">2012</xref>). Granivory of a particular seed species depends on relative resource availability in the habitat, attributes of the granivores, and the morphological, physiological, and defensive properties of the seed themselves (Lundgren 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">2009</xref>). Clearly in the case of this study system, dandelion seeds were palatable to a wide variety of arthropods.
