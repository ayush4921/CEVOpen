<p>The use of protein marking of seeds offers opportunities for understanding the structure of seed-associated food webs, but there are constraints to the method that also need to be recognized. First, this work clearly demonstrates that the method for applying the marker affects the preferences of the granivore (although it is important to note that different taxa were used to test the two marking methods in this study). Care must be taken not to weaken the seed coat or imbibe the seed, as the strength of the testa constrains which arthropods will successfully consume the seed (Cardina et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">1996</xref>; Lundgren and Rosentrater 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">2007</xref>). The duration of marker stability in the environment and in the insect gut are important considerations for designing experiments using this technique. Ninety percent of the marker is removed from the seed within 4 days of environmental exposure, so targeting arthropod collections within the first few days following seed deployment is advisable. Method development work suggests that the marker was detectable in the stomachs of the carabid beetle

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">2011</xref>). The trophic linkages revealed by this method should be conservatively interpreted because the method gives only a sample of the taxa that have eaten the marked seed within a few hours of being collected and frozen. In the end, the paired use of gut analysis and protein marking of seeds is a powerful tool that is best used in concert with other methods (seed removal, population monitoring, etc.) to get a more complete picture of the dynamic interactions of seeds and their granivore community.
