<p>The work on post-dispersal granivory of an invasive plant suggests that granivore communities are a diverse group including what are traditionally regarded as seed specialists as well as polyphagous arthropods. These soil arthropod communities are shaped by biotic and abiotic characteristics of a habitat, and can be managed to inflict greater effects on a target pest. As such, conserving a healthy and diverse soil arthropod community that can adapt to and resist seedling establishment of exotic plants may be an important component of greater management strategies for curtailing the harm caused by these invasives.</p>
