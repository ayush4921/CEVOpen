<p>Musk thistle’s life cycle was accelerated by warming and earlier reproductive phenology and, as a result, musk thistle’s projected annual population growth rate increased. Experimentally applied warming significantly increased survival and growth. Our experimental manipulation of the timing of seed release had a strong effect on the sizes that new seedlings reached at the end of the growing season. Improved performance of new recruits had effects that perpetuated throughout the musk thistle life cycle. Earlier seed release resulted in increased annualism and increased size at flowering, both of which contribute to increased population growth rate with earlier seed release.</p>
