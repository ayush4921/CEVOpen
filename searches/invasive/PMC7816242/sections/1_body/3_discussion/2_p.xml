<p>Phenological responses to warming have been linked to changes in population sizes, but the mechanisms that underlie these correlations remain unknown (Miller‐Rushing et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3219-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Successful tracking of warming climates has been suggested as a driver of invasive species success (Willis et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3219-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>, Wolkovich et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3219-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>), while failure to shift phenology has been implicated in the decline in abundance of other species (Willis et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3219-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Here we focused on a key mechanism by which earlier reproductive phenology may influence demography: increasing the sizes of new recruits and consequently their probability of surviving and reproducing earlier. Similar mechanisms have been observed in studies focused on mammals (Ozgul et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3219-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>, Frick et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3219-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>), where seasonally earlier reproduction increased offspring survival and reduced age at first reproduction. This pattern, where advancing reproductive phenology allows for increased growth of offspring and subsequent demographic changes may be widely relevant in other systems. Phenological head starts for new recruits may influence population dynamics by increasing the proportion of individuals that are “lucky,” the highly successful individuals that contribute disproportionately high numbers of offspring to populations (Snyder and Ellner
