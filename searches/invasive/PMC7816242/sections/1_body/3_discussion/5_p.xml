<p>We saw no change in the size threshold for flowering when plants were experimentally warmed. This finding suggests that this trait is insensitive to temperature. Warming increased the average size of flowering individuals, but this was a result of changes in annual growth increments and in the size of new recruits that reproduce as annuals rather than a change in the size threshold for flowering. This threshold is a well‐studied trait (Metcalf et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3219-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>, Williams 
 <xref rid="ecy3219-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>), and prior work shows that thistles trade‐off between the immediate value of reproducing at a given size and the potential to grow larger and produce more offspring in the next growing season, discounted by the probability of dying before being able to realize any future potential reproduction. Because this trait is so closely related to individual plants’ fitness, the threshold size for flowering may be subject to selection (Stearns and Koella 
 <xref rid="ecy3219-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">1986</xref>, Williams 
 <xref rid="ecy3219-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>), and as temperature changes occur gradually over time, the size threshold for flowering may shift as well. As natural selection recalibrates this trait to a changing environment, it is possible that future musk thistle populations will outperform our projections.
