<p>The two treatments, temperature and seed release timing, were crossed in a split plot design, with seed release dates splitting temperature treatments. Within each of 6 (cohort 1) and 10 (cohort 2) blocks, we established 2 × 2 m plots for each temperature treatment and randomly divided the eight seed‐release timing treatments (including a control) across them. For the first cohort, each block contained two plots that were randomly assigned to a temperature treatment: one at ambient temperature and one warmed. The seven seed release timing treatments and an unplanted control were randomly allocated to eight areas arranged in a circle in each plot to avoid any effects of chamber edges, which had a slight overhang. For the second cohort, each block contained four plots, two of which were randomly selected to be warmed, leaving the remaining two at ambient temperatures. For this cohort, each plot contained four areas located around the plot center separated by &gt;30 cm, and the seven planting time treatments plus the unplanted control were randomly allocated over the eight warmed and over the eight ambient areas present within the block (now divided over two plots each, see Appendix
