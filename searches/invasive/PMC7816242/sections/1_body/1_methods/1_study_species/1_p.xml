<p>Musk thistle, 
 <italic>Carduus nutans</italic> L. (Asteraceae), is a weed of Eurasian origin and a pest in pastures and rangelands, where its spiny leaves inhibit grazing, reducing livestock productivity (Desrochers et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3219-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">1988</xref>). This thistle has invaded disturbed areas in North America, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand (Jongejans et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3219-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). It is widespread in North America (USDA NRCS 
 <xref rid="ecy3219-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Musk thistle is a short‐lived monocarpic perennial. Individuals germinate in the fall or spring and can persist for one to several years as rosettes before bolting, flowering, releasing wind‐dispersed seeds, and dying (Desrochers et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3219-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">1988</xref>). Musk thistle is a prolific seed producer, with individual plants capable of producing thousands of wind‐dispersed seeds that germinate well immediately following release (Popay et al.
