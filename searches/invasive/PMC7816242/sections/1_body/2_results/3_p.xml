<p>Demographic modeling integrated changes in vital rates and changes in the size distribution of new seedlings to project a substantial acceleration in the life cycle of musk thistle under warming. Under current conditions (ambient temperatures, first full flowering date 29 June), we project that 60.8% of individuals flower as annuals. Under moderate warming and with the expected corresponding advance in phenology (+0.36°C, first full flowering date 25 June), however, we project that 70.8% of individuals will flower as annuals (mean difference in proportion annuals = 10.0%, 95% CI [9.5%, 10.5%], Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy3219-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The increase in the proportion of individuals flowering as annuals was caused by two factors: larger recruit sizes due to earlier seed release phenology, which increased the proportion of individuals that meet the size requirement for flowering in their first year, and higher survival under warming, which increased the proportion of individuals that survive their first year to reach reproduction. We also project that warming and corresponding phenological shifts are expected to significantly increase the total proportion of individuals that ever successfully reproduce, from 72.6% of individuals under current conditions to 89.5% of individuals under warming (mean difference in proportion that ever reproduce = 16.9%, 95% CI [15.9%, 18.0%]). Here again, improved survival under warming and larger recruit sizes drove this result.
