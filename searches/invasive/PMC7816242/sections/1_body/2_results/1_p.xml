<p>Warming significantly increased musk thistle survival and growth across all sizes (Fig.

 <xref rid="ecy3219-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>: Table S2). Size‐dependent probability of survival was significantly affected by warming treatment (χ
 <sup>2</sup>(1) = 10.05, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.002). Survival was higher for warmed plants, with the estimated probability of survival ranging from 73.2% for small individuals (longest leaf length = 0.5 cm) to 95.8% for large individuals (longest leaf length = 50 cm). For plants grown at ambient temperatures, we estimated small individuals had a 49.9% probability of surviving, while large individuals had an 89.4% probability. Warming also significantly affected growth from year to year (χ
 <sup>2</sup>(1) = 16.39, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Across all sizes, warmed plants were expected to have larger next‐year size. For example, under warming, small individuals with longest leaf length 0.5 cm are projected to grow to have longest leaf length 7.4 cm on average at the end of the next year’s growing season, while the same small individuals under ambient temperatures are projected to grow to have longest leaf length of only 4.3 cm on average. We did not observe a significant difference in the number of seeds produced by individuals of a given size when they were subjected to experimental warming (χ
 <sup>2</sup>(1) = 2.50, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.11), nor did we observe a significant effect of temperature on size‐dependent probability of flowering (χ
 <sup>2</sup>(1) = 0.03, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.858).
