<p>Climate warming has caused changes in many organisms’ phenology (Parmesan and Yohe

 <xref rid="ecy3219-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). Changes in phenology may affect demography, but generally the demographic consequences of phenological shifts remain unclear (Miller‐Rushing et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3219-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>, but see Ozgul et al.

 <xref rid="ecy3219-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Although phenology’s effects on individuals’ performance have been documented in numerous cases (Van Dongen et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3219-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>, Colautti and Barrett 
 <xref rid="ecy3219-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>, Scheepens and Stöcklin 
 <xref rid="ecy3219-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>), linking differences in performance to demographic outcomes is difficult, as changes in traits do not always lead to changes in population dynamics (McLean et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3219-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Observational work suggests that phenological sensitivity may underlie changes in species’ abundance over time, however. More phenologically sensitive plant and bird species, for example, are less likely to have declined in abundance over time (Møller et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3219-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>, Willis et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3219-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Additionally, high phenological sensitivity may contribute to the growth of invasive populations (Willis et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3219-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Together, these trends suggest a link between phenology and demography, but mechanisms driving those links remain elusive.
