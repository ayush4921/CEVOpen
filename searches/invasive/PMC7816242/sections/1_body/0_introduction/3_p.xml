<p>Organisms with flexible life histories may see large changes to their demography as temperatures rise. Short‚Äêlived monocarpic perennial plants, which can grow for one to several years and die after reproducing, may see large effects of warming and phenology on both the number of offspring produced and the time it takes for individuals to produce them. Monocarpic perennials have served as illuminating model systems in which to investigate the evolution of plant life histories (Metcalf et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3219-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>), and they make a tractable experimental system in which to investigate climate impacts on life cycles.
