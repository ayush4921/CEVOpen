<p>Here we report the results of a field experiment in which we independently manipulated temperature and reproductive phenology, specifically, timing of seed release. We focus on musk thistle (
 <italic>Carduus nutans</italic> L.), a widespread invasive species that advances flowering in response to warming (Zhang et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3219-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Musk thistle is a monocarpic perennial with size‚Äêdependent reproduction. Changes in growth are therefore expected to directly affect the musk thistle life cycle and hence its demography. We consider the joint impacts of warming and advanced reproductive phenology across the full life cycle of 
 <italic>C. nutans</italic> using demographic models, and address the following:
