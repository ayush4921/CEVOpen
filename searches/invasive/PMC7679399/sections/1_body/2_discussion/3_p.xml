<p id="Par19">The disproportionate distribution of mycorrhizal benefits by CMNs between these invasive and native plants may have played a role in the competitive success of invasive 
 <italic>E. sphaerocephalus</italic> grown with domestic 
 <italic>I. conyzae</italic>. However, the competitive advantage of 
 <italic>E. sphaerocephalus</italic> over 
 <italic>I. conyzae</italic> is more likely due to lower abundances of AM fungal taxa in roots of 
 <italic>I. conyzae</italic>, when grown in the presence of invader (
 <italic>E. sphaerocephalus</italic>), compared to growth without the invasive. Our results are similar to Zhang et al.
