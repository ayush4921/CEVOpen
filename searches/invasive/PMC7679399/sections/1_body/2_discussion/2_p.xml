<p id="Par18">Contrary to our second hypothesis, the difference between the M+ and M− treatments was more pronounced in plants grown in experimentally disturbed soil. In fact, the positive effect of AM fungi abolished negative effects of disturbance on the invasive 
 <italic>E. sphaerocephalus</italic>. This hypothesis was based on our assumption that competitive advantages of invasive plant would originate from linking with existing CMNs and disproportionally profit, at the expense of competing native plants, with the strongest advantage observed in invasive plants grown in pots with non-disturbed CMNs. However, this was not supported by our data, as the invader was competitively more proficient with mycorrhizal inoculation in both initially disturbed and non-disturbed treatments. Although we cannot confirm or reject existence of CMNs directly, molecular analyses indicated that both the invasive and native plants generally shared the same AM fungal taxa, with 
 <italic>F. mosseae</italic> being dominant, regardless of native or invasive plant species. The absence of effects of disturbance on abundance of AM fungi supports a rapid recovery of CMNs following disturbance. Therefore, the invasive plant with intact mycelium was not at an advantage over invasive plants with initially disturbed mycelium.
