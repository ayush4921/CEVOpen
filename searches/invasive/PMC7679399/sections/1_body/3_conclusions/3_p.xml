<p id="Par23">Ecosystems containing nonnative invasive plant species are common, but mechanisms promoting their co-occurrence are not well understood. It may become increasingly important to study the widespread effects of AM fungi on nonnative plant invasibility and establishment as these fungi affect plant species coexistence and community composition

 </sup>. Understanding the mechanisms leading to successful invasion may be especially important in light of global alterations such as increases in invasive plant species, but also climate change, alterations in nutrient availability, and land use changes. This is the first study to directly assess the role of AM fungi in the competition of 
 <italic>E. sphaerocephalus</italic> with a native plant. Our experiment was limited to pair-wise interactions among plant species, and this is a critical first step in resolving complex interactions that occur among native and nonnative plant species in a community. The next step will include assessments of additional invasive-native plant pairs to allow generalization of the results to a broader range of plant taxa, with an ultimate goal of assessing AM fungi in field studies.
