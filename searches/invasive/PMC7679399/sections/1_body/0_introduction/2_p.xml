<p id="Par3">AM mycelium often interconnects two or more plant individuals of the same or different species, establishing arbuscular (common) mycorrhizal networks (CMNs;

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, CMNs affect the survival, fitness, and competitiveness of their hosts, regulate plant coexistence
