  <p>Abundance of the different arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal taxa in the roots of the native plant species 
   <italic>Inula conyzae</italic> as affected by community assembly i.e., plant combination (invasive-native: invasive and native plant growing in competition; native-native: only native plants of the same species growing together) or community assembly and soil disturbance (disturbed: substrate in the pot disturbed before target plants inserted; non-disturbed: target plants planted into non-disturbed substrate, resulting in non-disturbed CMNs of M+ pots) after the second harvest. Bars represent means accompanied by standard errors (n = 20 or n = 10, respectively). Different letters above individual bars indicate significant differences between means at 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05.
