 <caption> Experimental design. This design was used for both harvests. Both mycorrhizal (M+) and nonmycorrhizal (M−) pots were pre-planted with a nurse plant Festuca pratensis. Soil was disturbed or left intact before target plants were planted, resulting in disturbed or non-disturbed arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) networks in M+ treatment. Each figured pot contained 5 replicates. </caption>
