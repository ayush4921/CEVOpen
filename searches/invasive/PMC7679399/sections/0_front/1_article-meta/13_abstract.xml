 <p id="Par1">In a globalized world, plant invasions are common challenges for native ecosystems. Although a considerable number of invasive plants form arbuscular mycorrhizae, interactions between arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and invasive and native plants are not well understood. In this study, we conducted a greenhouse experiment examining how AM fungi affect interactions of co-occurring plant species in the family Asteracea, invasive 
  <italic>Echinops sphaerocephalus</italic> and native forb of central Europe 
  <italic>Inula conyzae</italic>. The effects of initial soil disturbance, including the effect of intact or disturbed arbuscular mycorrhizal networks (CMNs), were examined. AM fungi supported the success of invasive 
  <italic>E. sphaerocephalus</italic> in competition with native 
  <italic>I. conyzae</italic>, regardless of the initial disturbance of CMNs. The presence of invasive 
  <italic>E. sphaerocephalus</italic> decreased mycorrhizal colonization in 
  <italic>I. conyzae</italic>, with a concomitant loss in mycorrhizal benefits. Our results confirm AM fungi represent one important mechanism of plant invasion for 
  <italic>E. sphaerocephalus</italic> in semi-natural European grasslands.
