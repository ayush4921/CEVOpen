<p>Despite the widely accepted relationship between environmental stress and fitness, and chlorophyll fluorescence as an indicator of environmental stress [

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], a link between the chlorophyll fluorescence and fitness has been not clearly demonstrated. Plants of 
 <italic>T. officinale</italic> that showed higher maximum quantum efficiency of Photosystem II produced higher seed-output, suggesting that physiological performance is a good predictor for fitness. Similar results have been found in the past. For example, Figueroa et al. (1997) [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] showed that those Mediterranean species with higher survival percentage showed higher physiological performance towards end of the growing season. These results could be attributed to changes in photosynthetic pathways, reducing the specificity factor of Rubisco from carboxylation toward oxygenation, with a decrease in the photosynthetic performance. On the other hand, thereduction of the net photosynthetic CO
 <sub>2</sub> assimilation rate has been attributed to stomatal closure and increased diffusive resistance of the mesophyll cells, the main cause for decreased photochemical efficiency under fluctuating water availability [

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Additionally, a decrease in Fv / Fm under fluctuating water availability could reflect an alteration in flow of electron transporter rate in photosystem II (PSII) that reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis [
