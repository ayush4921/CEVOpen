<p>To test the hypothesis that seed-output is directly affected by physiological performance, we used standard Pearson correlation in order to investigate the relationship between quantum yield and seed output in 
 <italic>T. officinale</italic> individuals from different localities. Each pair of measurements used to estimate Pearson correlations (physiological performance and seed-output) were recorded in the same individual. On the other hand, we assessed the R-square obtained from Pearson correlations for each locality with the precipitation seasonality (considered as the coefficient of variation of precipitations (CV = Standard deviation / Mean)) in order to evaluate if the strength of the physiology-fitness relationship is modified with environmental scenario. Finally, in order to evaluate if the relationship between physiological performance and seed-output of different localities had an adaptive value, we plotted the variation in fitness (seed output) of all 
 <italic>T. officinale</italic> localities with the physiological performance (Fv / Fm) and precipitation seasonality in both homogeneous and heterogeneous watering condition. Climatic data from each sampled locality was downloaded from the WorldClim data-base (
