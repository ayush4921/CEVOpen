<p>Seeds of 
 <italic>T. officinale</italic> were collected in 17 localities from five continents (
 <xref rid="pone-0076432-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Within each locality a small number of seeds (four to five) per forty to forty-five individual plants were collected. This material provided the initial pool of seeds. Seeds from all localities were germinated in a room at 24 ± 2 °C on wet filter paper in Petri dishes and planted in 500-mL plastic pots filled with potting soil. First generation plants (F
 <sub>1</sub>) were generated from this initial seed pool and were grown in a greenhouse at Universidad de Concepción, Concepción, Chile (36°48´ S, 73°03´ W) under natural conditions of light and temperature (1300 µmol m
 <sup>-2</sup>s
 <sup>-1</sup> ± 50 and 22 ± 2 °C, respectively). All plants were watered daily with 75 ml of tap water. After five months these plants produced the achenes that were used to obtain experimental plants (F
 <sub>2</sub>).
