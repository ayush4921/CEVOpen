 <caption>
  <title>Relationship between fitness (seed-output) and maximum quantum yield (Fv / Fm) of 
   <italic>Taraxacum officinale</italic> from localities with different precipitation seasonality (considered as the coefficient of variation of precipitations (CV = Standard deviation / Mean)), and exposed to different irrigation treatments.
  </title>
  <p>Seed-output was calculated as the ratio between the number of filled seeds and the total number of seeds (i.e., including aborted seeds) produced per capitula. Seed-output is showed with different colors as indicated in the box inside of the figure.</p>
