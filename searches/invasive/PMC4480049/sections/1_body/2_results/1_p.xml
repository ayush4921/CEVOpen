<p>Both the decrease in temperature and availability of nutrients resulted in a decrease in the RD of the seedlings (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV044F1">1</xref>) and increase in the time from the appearance of the first and seventh pair of stem leaves (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV044F1">1</xref>). The slopes of the regression lines arising from the three nutrient levels are significantly different [analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA), 
 <italic>F</italic> = 12.37, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001]. The highest temperature of 34 °C resulted in 5.1, 5.3 and 5.8 times faster development than at 10 °C for the low, moderate and high nutrient levels, respectively. A decrease in the availability of nutrients also resulted in a decrease in the LDT from 5.4 to 3.0 °C (Table 
 <xref rid="PLV044TB1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and increase in the SET needed to complete this stage in the development of the plants from 392.5 to 546.9 DD (Table 
 <xref rid="PLV044TB1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Consequently, the thermal window for development was increased from 28.7 °C when the plants were provided with a full nutrient supply to 31.0 °C when provided with the weakest nutrient supply.
