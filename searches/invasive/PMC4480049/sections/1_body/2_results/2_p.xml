<p>The seedlings grew taller with increase in temperature and decrease in nutrient availability (Table

 <xref rid="PLV044TB2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV044F2">2</xref>B). With decrease in nutrients and decrease in temperature, the seedlings allocated more biomass to roots (Table
