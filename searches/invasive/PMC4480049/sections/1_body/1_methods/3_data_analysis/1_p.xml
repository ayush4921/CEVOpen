<p>The rate of development was defined as 1/(time in days between appearance of the first and seventh pair of stem leaves) = 1/d. For each nutrient level, the relationship between the RD and temperature (
 <italic>t</italic>) was fitted by a linear equation in which 
 <italic>a</italic> is the intercept with the 
 <italic>y</italic>-axis and 
 <italic>b</italic> is the slope: RD = 
 <italic>a</italic> + 
 <italic>bt</italic> (

 </xref>). The LDT, i.e. base temperature, at which the RD ceases (i.e. RD = 0), was then calculated as LDT = −
 <italic>a</italic>/
 <italic>b</italic>. The values were calculated separately for individual nutrient levels. The SET thus corresponds to 1/
 <italic>b</italic>, which indicates the number of DD above the LDT. Thermal window was expressed as the difference between the LDT, and the temperature at which the maximum RD was recorded.
