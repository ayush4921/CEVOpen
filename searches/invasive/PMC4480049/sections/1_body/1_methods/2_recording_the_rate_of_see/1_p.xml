<p>To record the time between the appearance of the first and seventh pair of stem leaves (excluding cotyledons), the plants were checked and measured daily (following 
 <xref rid="PLV044C19" ref-type="bibr">Gramig and Stoltenberg 2007</xref>). The leaves were assumed to have appeared when their size was equal to or exceeded 1 mm. After appearance of the seventh pair of leaves, height was measured and the plants harvested. The biomass was divided into shoots and roots, dried at 70 Â°C for 8 h and weighed.
