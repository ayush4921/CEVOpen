The seedlings were cultivated at constant temperatures of 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30 and 34 °C, which is the full range of temperatures possible using the above growth chambers. The three different nutrient levels used in our experiments were obtained using 10, 50 and 100 % Knop nutrient solution; 100 % Knop solution contained 152 mg N/L. To achieve a stable nutrient supply, conductivity of the solutions was measured daily and nutrient solution or demineralized water was added to keep the conductivity at 370, 1770, 3450 μS cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. In addition, the nutrient solutions were changed every second day to prevent the growth of algae.
