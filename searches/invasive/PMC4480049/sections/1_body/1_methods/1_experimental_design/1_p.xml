<p>The seeds of 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> were collected at a ruderal site (48°43′35.0″N; 16°58′42.7″E) 1.4 km south-east of the town of Lanžhot in S Moravia, the Czech Republic, in October 2009. We collected ∼1000 seeds from at least 50 plants in a population of hundreds of individuals growing in an area of ∼300 m
 <sup>2</sup> at a soil dump. After collection, the seeds were stored in paper bags at room temperature. Before the experiment, the seeds were cold-stratified in wet sand in the dark at 4 °C for 3 months and then germinated at a diurnally fluctuating temperature of 25/10 °C (day/night cycle 12 h/12 h with a corresponding light/dark alternation). Germinated seeds with a radicle length of 5–10 mm were moved to containers filled with pure silica sand. Sixteen germinated seeds were planted and grown at each of the temperatures and nutrient regimes, giving a total of 336 plants (i.e. 7 temperature regimes × 3 nutrient regimes × 16 replicates). Some of the seeds did not germinate or the seedlings died during cultivation and in total 48 individuals (14.2 % of the initial set) were lost.
