<p>Climate-dependent phenological models suggest that the distribution of 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> in Europe is limited by low temperatures in the North where plants are prevented from completing reproduction by autumn frosts, which kill adult plants (
 <xref rid="PLV044C5" ref-type="bibr">Chapman 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2014
 </xref>), and drought in the South, which inhibits seed germination and seedling emergence (

  <italic>et al</italic>. 2014
 </xref>). On the other hand, other environmental variables such as habitat type, land use, crop type and soil nutrients also play a role in the occurrence and abundance of 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> at a regional scale (

  <italic>et al</italic>. 2011
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="PLV044C37" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). At a local scale, soil disturbance and removal of vegetation enhance seedling recruitment of ragweed from the soil-seed bank (
