<p>To obtain a detailed insight into the ecological factors that are likely to co-determine the performance of 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> in the field, we investigated the effect of temperature and nutrient availability on the rate of development (RD) of its seedlings. The good survival of seedlings is crucial for the establishment and successful population regeneration of annual species and there are several studies directly linking seedling traits with invasion success (

This approach, which is based on measuring the rate of plant development at different temperatures, provides results that can be used to calculate the following characteristics: the lower developmental threshold—LDT (the temperature below which development ceases); the sum of effective temperatures—SET [the amount of heat needed to complete a developmental stage measured in degree days (DD) above the LDT] and thermal window (the difference between the minimum and maximum temperatures of the range over which development occurs) (
