<p>In this paper, we ask the following questions: What are the effects of temperature and nutrient availability on the RD of 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> seedlings? What is the SET and LDT for development and are they modified by nutrient availability? How does nutrient availability affect variations in the thermal window of this species? What are the effects of temperature and nutrient availability on size and biomass allocation in seedlings?
