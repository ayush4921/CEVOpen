<p>Plant species distributions are determined by the response of populations to regional climates. Alien plants, many of which arrive in regions from areas with a warmer climate, provide a suitable model for studying the effect of temperature on determining their distribution. Since the early stage of population development is crucial for determining whether or not a species can successfully establish in a given region (
