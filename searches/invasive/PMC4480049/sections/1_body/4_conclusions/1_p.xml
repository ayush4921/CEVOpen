<p>We found that 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> plants grow within a temperature range exceeding the 20 Â°C thermal window, predicted based on the biochemical kinetics of metabolism. The LDT and SET were influenced by growing condition, which contradicts the thermal constant concept. Our results highlight temperature as the main determinant of common ragweed's distribution and identify nutrient availability as a factor that results in the realized niche being smaller than the fundamental niche; both of which need to be taken into account when predicting the future spread of 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic>.
