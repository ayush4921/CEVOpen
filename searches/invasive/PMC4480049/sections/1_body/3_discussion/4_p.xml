<p>The faster increase in height of 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> seedlings recorded at high temperatures may prevent them from being shaded by neighbouring vegetation, and increase the competitive ability of plants in early stages of population establishment. On the other hand, the tall seedlings that developed at high temperatures weighed less and were weak plants, which may have an opposite effect. In addition, the competitiveness at high temperatures is probably further decreased by reduced allocation to the roots, which constrains nutrient acquisition. The negative effect of nutrient limitation on the performance of 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> and the interaction of nutrient availability with temperature explains why this species is confined to nutrient-rich disturbed habitats (
