<p>The maximum rate of leaf development of seedlings of 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> was recorded in our experiment at 34 °C, which is close to the 31.7 °C reported by 
 <xref rid="PLV044C11" ref-type="bibr">Deen 
  <italic>et al</italic>. (1998
  <italic>b</italic>)
 </xref> and the maximum rates of development are also similar. Here it needs to be noted that the rate of seedling development increased up to the highest temperature we used, and testing the response to temperatures above 34 °C was not possible due to the technical limitations of the growth chambers. Nevertheless, the abrupt decrease in biomass recorded at the highest temperature and taking into account the results of 
 <xref rid="PLV044C11" ref-type="bibr">Deen 
  <italic>et al</italic>. (1998
  <italic>b</italic>)
 </xref> it is reasonably certain that 34 °C is indeed likely to be the maximum temperature at which 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> seedlings can develop. Our results also reveal that the optimum temperature for leaf development is much higher than that for seed germination, which is 18.3 °C (
