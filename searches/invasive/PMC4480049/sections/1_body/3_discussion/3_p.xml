<p>The width of the thermal window for seedling development varied from 28.7 to 31.0 °C depending on the nutrient supply, which differs from the theoretical prediction based on the biochemical kinetics of metabolism of a constant width of 20 °C (

  <italic>et al</italic>. 2002
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="PLV044C6" ref-type="bibr">Charnov and Gillooly 2003</xref>). The deviation from this theoretical prediction, as well as the recorded variation in the RD, LDT and SET, is associated with the availability of nutrients; to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study assessing the effect of an environmental factor on thermal constants of a plant. Still, there are some commonalities if our results are compared with those for insects; the increased rate of seedling development at high nutrient supply is analogous to faster development of ladybirds provided with either more and/or better quality food (

 </xref>). For plants, the accelerating effect of nutrients on the development of 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> corresponds to the faster leaf development previously recorded at higher levels of radiance for this species (

 </xref>), or the increase in the rate of leafing and tillering of the tropical grass 
 <italic>Brachiaria brizantha</italic> recorded when provided with nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) fertilizers (
 <xref rid="PLV044C9" ref-type="bibr">de Bona and Monteiro 2010</xref>). Unlike in aphids and ladybirds (

  <italic>et al</italic>. 2013
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="PLV044C25" ref-type="bibr">Jarošík 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2014
 </xref>), the increased nutrient supply did not result in a decrease in the LDT; on the contrary, nutrient-limited seedlings of the common ragweed had lower LDT. However, it needs to be noted that we derived the LDT from a linear model of plant development and possible non-linearity may occur at temperatures &lt;10 °C. The thermal window of 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> is also very wide compared with experimentally obtained windows of a large set of both native and invasive species in central Europe (L. Moravcová and H. Skálová, unpubl. data). Whether a flexible thermal window is a trait associated with invasiveness, which resulted from the evolution of highly invasive genotypes of 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> due to seed-mediated gene flow promoted by agricultural disturbance during the westward expansion of human populations in the USA (
 <xref rid="PLV044C33" ref-type="bibr">Martin 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2014
 </xref>), requires further study. The same holds for possible development of genotypes with wider thermal windows or those shifted towards lower temperatures driven by the existence of locally adapted genotypes, similar to those reported to occur in 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> for salinity (
