<abstract abstract-type="precis">
 <p>Little is known about how alien plants that arrive in central Europe from climatically warmer regions cope with the temperature conditions at the early stage of population development. Using 
  <italic>Ambrosia artemisiifolia</italic> (common ragweed), an invasive annual plant as a model, we found that the rate of seedling development decreased with decrease in temperature and nutrient supply. Our results thus highlight temperature as the main determinant of common ragweed's distribution and identify nutrient availability as a factor that results in the realized niche being smaller than the fundamental niche.
