 <italic>Ambrosia artemisiifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>A. trifida</italic> were mainly distributed in farmland ecotone, roadside, residential area, grassland valley, and other accumulated water in the Yili Valley (Dong et al., 2013), and there was no obvious law for the difference in soil temperature of the four habitats in different periods (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36902-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Therefore, we believe that the existing distribution pattern of the two species is not mainly affected by temperature in the Yili Valley.
