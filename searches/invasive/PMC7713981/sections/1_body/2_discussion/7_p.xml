<p>Since the causes of species distribution include factors other than interspecific competition, seed size, and water demand, other issues need to be discussed in future work if researchers wish to better explain the reasons for the differences between these two species. Additional factors to investigate include the following: (a) How temperature and water work collectively to affect the germination, growth, and reproduction of these two species; and (b) quantitative analysis of the influence of the difference in seed size on the difference in distribution of the two species.</p>
