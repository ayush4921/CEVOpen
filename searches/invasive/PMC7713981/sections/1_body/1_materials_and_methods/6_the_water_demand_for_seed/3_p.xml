<p>Under 560 and 840 mm of simulated annual precipitation, 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>A. trifida</italic> both grew better than under 280 mm of annual precipitation during the growing period. The growth of 
 <italic>A. trifida</italic> was very poor, with a low seed yield, whereas 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> grew better than 
 <italic>A. trifida</italic> under 280 mm of annual precipitation. When comparing plants experiencing 840 mm of simulated rainfall and 280 mm of annual precipitation during the growing period, the densities and plant heights of these two species were not significantly different in ES. From the FR to MR, the density, plant height, and seed yield of 
 <italic>A. trifida</italic> decreased more than those of 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic>. In FR, the density and plant height of 
 <italic>A. trifida</italic> decreased by 88.5% and 74.5%, respectively, while those of 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> decreased by 24.5% and 21.6%, respectively (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36902-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The seed yield per m
 <sup>2</sup> of 
 <italic>A. trifida</italic> decreased from 50,185 to 19, while that of 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> decreased from 15,579 to 530 (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36902-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>).
