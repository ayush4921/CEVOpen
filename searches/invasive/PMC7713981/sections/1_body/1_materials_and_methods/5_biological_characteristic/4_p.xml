 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> was significantly higher than that of the companion species in the farmland ecotone and residential area from EG period to MR period, at 1.84 and 1.7 times that of the companion species in FR period, respectively. However, the coverage was significantly lower than the companion species in grassland, at 0.53 times that of the companion species in FR period (Figure
