<p>The 100‐seed weight and seed size of 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>A. trifida</italic> in roadside habitats were significantly lower than those in other habitats. The seed size of 
 <italic>A. trifida</italic> was about five times that of 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic>, while the weight of 
 <italic>A. trifida</italic> seeds was about eight times that of 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> (Figure
