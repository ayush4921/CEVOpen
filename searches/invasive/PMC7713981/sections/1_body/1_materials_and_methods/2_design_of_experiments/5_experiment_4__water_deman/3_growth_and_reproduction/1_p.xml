<p>A plant growth experiment was performed in the experimental garden from October 2017 to October 2018 in Yining City (43°50′–44°09′N,80°04′–81°29′E), located in the Yili Valley. This locale has an average annual temperature of 10.5°C and an average annual precipitation of 280 mm. Three irrigation treatment gradients were established in the experimental garden: (1) no irrigation with 280 mm of annual precipitation; (2) 2,800 m
 <sup>3</sup>/hm
 <sup>2</sup> of irrigation during the growth period (equivalent to 560 mm of annual precipitation supplemented by 400 m
 <sup>3</sup>/hm
 <sup>2</sup> of irrigation every month from April to October 2018), and (3) 5,600 m
 <sup>3</sup>/hm
 <sup>2</sup> of irrigation during growth period (equivalent to 840 mm of annual precipitation supplemented by 800 m
 <sup>3</sup>/hm
 <sup>2</sup> of irrigation every month from April to October 2018). Each water treatment was tested with three plots, and eighteen plots were randomly arranged with 3 m × 3 m plots for each irrigation sample area. Plastic film was buried vertically to a depth of 40 cm in the soil around each irrigation plot to separate the water received in each plot. Each plot was uniformly sprinkled with 900 seeds of
