<p>In order to compare the water demand between the two species analyzed, soil temperature and humidity meters (Watch Dog 1200, USA) were placed in the 10‐cm soil layer in the four habitats on 1 September 2017; the meters were removed on 2 October 2018. Each temperature and humidity meter recorded data every hour. The data from 1 October 2017 to 30 September 2018 were used to analyze the annual conditions. Three temperature and humidity recorders were placed in three individual sites for each habitat, and a total of 3 (repetition) × 4 (habitat) = 12 recording units were set up.</p>
