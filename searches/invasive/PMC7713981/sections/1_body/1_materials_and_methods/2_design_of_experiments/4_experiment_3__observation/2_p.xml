<p>In the ES (April 20), LS (May 20), EG (June 20), LG (July 20), FR (August 20), and MR (September 20) periods in 2017, the densities, coverage, and plant heights of the two 
 <italic>Ambrosia</italic> species and companion species were measured in the four habitats. Each observation plot was 5 m × 5 m. The plant heights were measured for 30 plants of 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>A. trifida</italic>, and 30 plants of companion species in each plot. If there were fewer than 30 
 <italic>Ambrosia</italic> or companion species plants, we measure all of them. Three plots from each habitat were taken in three individual sites, for a total of 3 (repetition) × 4 (habitat) sampling units in 12 plots being set up.
