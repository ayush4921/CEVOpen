<p>One‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple least significant difference comparisons were used to explore the differences in soil physical and chemical properties (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36902-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and soil temperature and humidity (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36902-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) between the four habitats, while 100‐seed weight, seed size, number of seeds per plant, and seed yield per m
 <sup>2</sup> were compared between 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>A. trifida</italic> (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36902-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). ANOVA was also used to examine differences in densities, coverage, and plant heights of 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>A. trifida</italic>, and companion species between the four habitats (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36902-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). ANOVA, multiple least significant difference comparisons, and 
 <italic>t</italic> tests were used to explore the differences in seed germination (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36902-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>), density and plant height (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36902-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), and seed yield (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36902-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>) of 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>A. trifida</italic> in different water gradients.IBM SPSS Statistics 20 was used for data analysis, and OriginPro 8.5 was employed for graphics.
