<p>Xinyuan County (43°03′–43°40′N, 82°28′–84°56′E) is located in the hinterland of the Gongnaisi grassland in the eastern part of the Yili Valley. This site is the main distribution area of 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>A. trifida</italic>. The average annual temperature and precipitation are 8.1°C and 480 mm, respectively. We studied the interspecific competitive ability, seed size, and water demand differences between the two species in farmland ecotone, residential area, roadside, and grassland in Xinyuan County, because these four habitats were the main distribution areas of the two species (Dong et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36902-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), and there were relatively large differences in water status, temperature status, and companion species between those four habitats.
