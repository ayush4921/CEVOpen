<p>The species abundances were measured in the 25 plots in each habitat. From 2010 to 2017, the abundance of 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> was higher than that of 
 <italic>A. trifida</italic> and increased rapidly in farmland ecotone, residential area, and roadside habitats. By 2017, total abundance of 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>A. trifida</italic> was 57% and 39%, respectively, so that 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> was 1.46 times more abundant than 
 <italic>A. trifida</italic>. However, the abundance of 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> in grassland was less than that of 
 <italic>A. trifida</italic>, where the latter was 3.5 times more abundant than the former (Figure
