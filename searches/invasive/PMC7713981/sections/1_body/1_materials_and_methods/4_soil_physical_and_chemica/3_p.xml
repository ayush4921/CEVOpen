<p>In SP, the soil temperature of farmland was significantly higher than in other habitats, and that of grassland was significantly lower than in other habitats; in GP, the soil temperatures of grassland and roadside were significantly lower than those of other habitats; in FFP, the roadside temperature was significantly lower than those of other habitats. The soil moisture in different habitats showed significant differences in different periods, and the values of soil moisture were ranked as follows: grassland &gt; farmland ecotone &gt; residential area &gt; roadside (Figure
