<p>Water availability affects plant seed germination, growth, and reproduction, factors that are the basis of species distribution and competition, especially in arid and semiarid areas. Leiblein‐Wild and Lösch (
 <xref rid="ece36902-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) found that 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> grew well under moist soil conditions and that it can survive in dry soils. 
 <italic>Ambrosia trifida</italic> needs more water than 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> (Abul‐Fatih &amp; Bazzaz, 
 <xref rid="ece36902-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1979</xref>; Bassett &amp; Crompton, 
 <xref rid="ece36902-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">1982</xref>). It is not clear how the water use capacity affects the distribution difference of the two species. Moreover, the link between the differences in distribution and water demand of these two species during seed germination, plant growth, and reproduction period remains unclear.
