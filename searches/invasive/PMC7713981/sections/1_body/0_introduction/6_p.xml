<p>The Yili Valley, Xinjiang, China, covers an area of 56,400 km
 <sup>2</sup> and contains a rich variety of habitats, including grasslands, farmlands, mountains, and residential areas (Jia et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36902-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Our previous study found that 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>A. trifida</italic> simultaneously invaded the same area of the Yili Valley in 2010, and we also found that the dominant habitat distributions of two species were different (Dong et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36902-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Therefore, the Yili Valley provides a large, relatively closed field experiment site in which to study the beginning of an invasion by the two species along with their subsequent diffusion. This study can therefore help to explain the distribution differences and causes for successful invasion of 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>A. trifida</italic>, providing insight into the reasons for the resulting distribution of these two species worldwide.
