<p>Distribution and abundance of 
 <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>A. trifida</italic> were surveyed and measured from 2010 to 2017 in the Yili Valley, Xinjiang, China. The soil physical and chemical properties, soil temperature and humidity, and the main companion species were determined in farmland ecotone, residential area, roadside, and grassland in 2017. Also, biological characteristics, such as density and coverage, plant height, number of seeds per plant, 100‐seed weight, and seed size of these two species and companion species (density and coverage, plant height) in four habitats, were measured in 2017. Moreover, the differences in water demand between the two species were studied through seed germination and garden experiments from October 2017 to October 2018. The following questions were explored: What were the differences in the distribution of these two species in the Yili Valley? What caused the differences in the distribution of these two species?
