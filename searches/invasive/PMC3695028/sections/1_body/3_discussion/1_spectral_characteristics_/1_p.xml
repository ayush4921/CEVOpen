<p>The spectral characteristics of each species were not unique between phenological stages. They were varying significantly according to their phenological stages. The phenology of plants generally determines the spectral characteristics of vegetation by determining the canopy structure, growth stage, water content, and chlorophyll content of vegetation 
 <xref rid="pone.0067315-Pu1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Spectral differences near the green waveband peak (around 550 nm), red edge (around 720 nm), and in the near-infrared plateau are considered important for discriminating vegetation types at growing stages 
 <xref rid="pone.0067315-Adam1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The differences near red edge and in the near-infrared plateau are usually characterized by differences in canopy structure and the differences near the green waveband peak are usually characterized by differences in chlorophyll content 
 <xref rid="pone.0067315-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In this case, the canopy structure between 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> and 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> was more similar than that between 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> and 
 <italic>Scirpus</italic> in most phonological stages (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0067315.s001">Figure S1</xref>), explaining why 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> is more spectrally separable from 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> than 
 <italic>Scirpus</italic>. 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> generates later than 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> and 
 <italic>Scirpus</italic>, causing it to have notably less green vegetative amounts and low plant height in late spring, thus making late spring the best period to monitor 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> by increasing the spectral separability at wavelengths near the green waveband peak, red edge, and in the near-infrared plateau (see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0067315-t005">Tables 5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0067315-t006">6</xref>). In summer, the three plants reached their peak heights with high chlorophyll content and similar canopy structures (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0067315.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Thus, they were difficult to separate with any hyper−/multi-spectral bands. A previous study, in a single summer, demonstrated that the vegetation amount in terms of the height and cover was important in determining the levels of reﬂectance, particularly at the near-infrared band of saltmarsh communities 
 <xref rid="pone.0067315-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In this study, 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> showed average high levels of near-infrared reflectance in summer (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067315-g003">Fig. 3g and 3</xref> h), as it had denser covers than 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> and 
 <italic>Scirpus</italic>, as well as clearly higher canopy altitudes than 
 <italic>Scirpus</italic> (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0067315.s001">Figure S1</xref>), but this average high near-infrared reflectance was not statistically significant. Early autumn, i.e. the flowering stage of 
 <italic>Spartina</italic>, is another good period to discriminate 
 <italic>Spartina</italic>. The bloom of 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> not only changed its pigment content and proportion but also changed its canopy structure suddenly, while 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> was at a vegetative growth or inflorescence stage and 
 <italic>Scirpus</italic> was at a withering stage (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0067315.s001">Figure S1</xref>), making perfect separability between 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> and the other two on bands located at the visible wavelength range. Another phenological characteristic of 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> is that it senesces and withers more slowly than 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> and 
 <italic>Scirpus</italic>; thus, in early winter, 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> can preserve more green vegetative parts (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0067315.s001">Figure S1</xref>). This phenomenon can result in statistical spectral differences in the visible wavelength region between 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> and the other plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067315-g004">Fig. 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067315-g005">5</xref>). Though these differences were small between 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> and 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> probably because of their similar canopy structure and tended to be marked out in broad multi-spectral bands, they can be enhanced by specific VIs to have enough separability to distinguish them (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0067315-t002">Table 2</xref>).
