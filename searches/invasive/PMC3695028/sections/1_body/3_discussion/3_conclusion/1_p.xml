<p>The field spectra of saltmarsh vegetation including 
 <italic>Spartina</italic>, 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>, and 
 <italic>Scirpus</italic> were collected and analyzed at multi-phenological stages in the largest estuarial wetland of the Yangtze River Estuary to find the best periods for mapping 
 <italic>Spartina</italic>. The three plants showed changing spectral characteristics affected by their phenological stages. The results suggest that the germination and early growth stages of 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> (late spring) as well as its flowering stage (early-autumn) may be the best periods to discriminate 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> from 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> and 
 <italic>Scirpus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0067315-t007">Table 7</xref>). The corresponding best-separable hyperâˆ’/multi-spectral bands were also determined for each period (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0067315-t007">Table 7</xref>). In late-spring, the most separable hyper-spectral bands are located near the green waveband peak, red edge, and in the near-infrared plateau and the multi-spectral bands are NIR and G. In early-autumn, the most separable hyper-spectral bands are located at the whole visible region and the multi-spectral bands are B, G, and R. By utilizing VIs like NDVI, ANVI, VNVI, and RVI, which take advantage of the reflectance contrast between NIR and other bands, it is also possible to discriminate 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> at its withering stage (late autumn and early winter). Proper usage of specific VIs might also enhance the spectral separability between those saltmarsh species in other periods.
