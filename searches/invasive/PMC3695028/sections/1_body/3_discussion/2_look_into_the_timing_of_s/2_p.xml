<p>While phenology is critical in determining vegetation spectral characteristics, the timings of phenological stages are adjusted to climate, like temperature and precipitation patterns. Therefore, optimum periods for saltmarsh vegetation discrimination might shift between years and the right way to determine the periods is to investigate the suggested emergence of phonological divergence between plants but to not adhere to any predetermined periods. A strategy that integrates multi-phenological images may produce a better result. However, improper usage of multi-date images might also waste money, produce redundant information, and increase image processing effort. Still, based on the abundant information provided, users can have their choice based on effectiveness and cost.</p>
