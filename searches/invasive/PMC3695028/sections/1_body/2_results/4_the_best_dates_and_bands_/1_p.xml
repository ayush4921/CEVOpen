 <italic>Phragmites</italic> and 
 <italic>Scirpus</italic>. Among all our sampled days, May 5, 31 and September 20 (which represent two periods, 
 <italic>e.g.</italic> later spring and early autumn) are clearly the best to discriminate 
 <italic>Spartina</italic>, as they have good- or perfect- separability between 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> and either of the other two natives on either hyper- or multi-spectral bands. However, hyper-spectral bands clearly show priority to detect more minor differences by providing more narrow bands that could discriminate each plant from the others at more periods, and the commonly used VIs based on multi-spectral broad bands could enhance their ability for plant discrimination, in terms of expanding time periods and increasing separability on original bands (
