 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0067315-t004">4</xref> show the statistical differences and JM distances on multi-spectral bands (B, G, R, and NIR) and the commonly used VIs at the multi-phenological stages between 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> and 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>, 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> and 
 <italic>Scirpus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> and 
 <italic>Scirpus,</italic> respectively. Excluding VIs, spectral difference and separability were limited on broad multi-spectral bands. 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> and 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> had perfect-separability on May 31 (NIR) and good separability on May 5 (G, R, and NIR) and September 20 (B, G, and R) (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0067315-t002">Table 2</xref>). The broadband spectral separability between 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> and 
 <italic>Scirpus</italic> was much better than that between 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> and 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>. Perfect- or good-separability bands were found on all surveyed days except July 2, July 22, and August 19 when 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> and 
 <italic>Scirpus</italic> were both near their growth summit (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0067315-t003">Table 3</xref>). The three tables also show that the VIs could enhance the spectral separability between the plants at many stages. The four broad bands between 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> and 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> on November 25 and December 22 had either poor- separability or were not statistically different, but the VIs like NDVI, RVI, VNVI, and ANVI were ranked with good- or perfect- separability (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0067315-t002">Table 2</xref>). The VIs significantly enhanced the spectral separability between 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> and 
 <italic>Scirpus</italic> on January 14, April 17, and July 22 (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0067315-t003">Table 3</xref>). The VIs also made it possible to discriminate 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> and 
 <italic>Scirpus</italic> in early winter and mid spring, as perfect-separability was obtained on the VIs, like NDVI and ANVI, on January 14 and April 17 (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0067315-t004">Table 4</xref>). On the whole, NDVI, VNVI, ANVI, and RVI more frequently performed enhanced separability than their combined original broad bands.
