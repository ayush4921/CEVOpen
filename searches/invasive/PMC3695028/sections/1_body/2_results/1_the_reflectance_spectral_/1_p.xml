<p>The mean reflectance spectral curves of 
 <italic>Spartina</italic>, 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>, and 
 <italic>Scirpus</italic> on different days at various phenological stages were plotted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067315-g003">Fig. 3</xref>. Spectral reflectance curves of the plants and the difference between them were affected by phenology. As the phenological stage changed, their spectral signatures exhibited differences in both magnitude and shape of reflectance curves. In the late-withering, dormant, and early germination stages (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067315-g003">Fig. 3a, b, c, k, and l</xref>), the reflectance curves of all plants showed slightly rising lines with no green peak, steep red edge, or near-infrared plateaus (common characteristics of green vegetation). The low chlorophyll content at these stages alone probably can explain the lack of green peak, while the higher reflectance in red due to no chlorophyll absorption and the lower reflectance around 800 nm associated with sparse leaf/canopy structure can explain the absence of the red edge. 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> was the earliest to show typical characteristics of green vegetation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067315-g003">Fig. 3c</xref>). 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> began to show a steep red edge and infrared plateau from April 17 as it sprouted in early April, though no green peaks were observed. Afterwards, the significant green peak, steeper red edge, and higher near-infrared plateau began to show from May 5 when 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> grew up to about 100 cm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067315-g003">Fig. 3d–i</xref>). The reflectance of near-infrared began to decline and the typical characteristics of green vegetation of its reflectance curves gradually disappeared as 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> was inflorescent and withering. 
 <italic>Scirpus</italic> also emerged in early April, but its rapid growth did not begin until late April; thus, its reflectance spectra showed a normal curve of green vegetation until May 5 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067315-g003">Fig. 3d</xref>) when it already grew to 
 <italic>ca.</italic> 15 cm. In its following growth, flowering, fruit development, and even early withering stage, 
 <italic>Scirpus</italic> showed higher near-infrared plateau (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067315-g003">Fig. 3e–i</xref>). However, its reflectance in green and near-infrared wavelength regions declined quickly from August as 
 <italic>Scirpus</italic> turned to mature and withering stages early. Conversely, 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> generated and grew about one month later than 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> and 
 <italic>Scirpus</italic>. Thus, in late spring (e.g., May 5 and 31), it has significantly lower reflectance than the 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> and 
 <italic>Scirpus</italic> in green and near-infrared wavelength regions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067315-g003">Fig. 3d–e</xref>). 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> was the latest to show a steep red edge and near-infrared plateau (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067315-g003">Fig. 3e</xref>), but later, it shows the highest reflectance in the near-infrared region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067315-g003">Fig. 3g–h</xref>). On the other hand, 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> withered later and slower than 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> and 
 <italic>Scirpus</italic>. Thus, its canopy reflectance curves were more similar to normal curves of green vegetation in later times of a year than 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> or 
 <italic>Scirpus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067315-g003">Fig. 3k–l</xref>).
