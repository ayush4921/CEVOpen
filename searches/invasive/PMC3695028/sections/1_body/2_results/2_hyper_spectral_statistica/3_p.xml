<p>There were few good- or perfect- separability bands between the two native species on most days (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067315-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Among all sampled days, May 5 and 31 were the best for discrimination between 
 <italic>Scirpus</italic> and 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>. The best bands for discrimination them were first concentrated in blue and red wavelength regions on May 5 and then shifted to red and near-infrared regions on May 31. Though December 22 showed perfect- separability and good-separability on a many bands, late December is not ideal for discrimination because the distribution of 
 <italic>Scirpus</italic> was narrowed by tidal water and was unable to get the real extent of 
 <italic>Scirpus</italic> according to our field observation.
