<p>It is obviously that 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> was more separable from 
 <italic>Scirpus</italic> than from 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> as a whole (Comparing to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067315-g004">Fig. 4</xref> to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067315-g005">5</xref>). No statistically different bands were found on July 2, 22 and there were no good- separability bands on August 19 between 
 <italic>Scirpus</italic> and 
 <italic>Spartina</italic>, when they were both in stages with high chlorophyll content. Nevertheless, with the exception of July 2, July 22, and August19, there were always many statistically different bands with either perfect- separability or good- separability. The perfect-separability bands primarily distributed in blue, red, and near-infrared wavelength regions, while the good- separability bands were more widely distributed.
