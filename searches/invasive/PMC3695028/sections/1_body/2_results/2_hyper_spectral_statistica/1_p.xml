 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067315-g006">6</xref> shows the statistical differences and JM distances at different phenological stages on 5 nm-wide hyper-spectral bands between each pairs of species, respectively. Good- and perfect- separability between 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> and 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> was achieved on September 20 and May 31. These perfect- separability bands on September 20 were between 405 and 475 nm while those on May 31 were between 735 and 900 nm. Those good- separability bands were distributed in the visible wavelength region (475–530 nm and 570–695 nm) on September 20 and in red and red edges (715–735 nm) on May 31. Good-separability bands between 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> and 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> were also observed on April 17 and May 5. These bands either fell into the green wavelength region or near-infrared wavelength region. On other days, No perfect- or good- separability bands emerged between 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> and 
 <italic>Spartina</italic>.
