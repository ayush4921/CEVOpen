<p>In spite of all of this, there is a common problem for either hyper-spectral imagery or VHR (very high-resolution) imagery in that they are difficult and expensive to acquire

 <xref rid="pone.0067315-Hochberg1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. This proposes an issue that the collected remote sensing data coincides with a period when suitable spectral differences between different vegetation types are captured by remote sensors. Field spectral discrimination serves as an important way to find the differences existing in spectral signatures between plant species

 <xref rid="pone.0067315-Cochrane1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. On the other hand, spectral characteristics of vegetation change obviously with time affected by phenology, complicating the problem but also providing opportunities of spectral discrimination and remote sensing mapping (i.e., some phases must be more appropriate than others for mapping). Therefore, it is important to identify species by exploiting spectral differences at proper phenological stages 
 <xref rid="pone.0067315-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Furthermore, spectral differences can be enhanced by using vegetation indices (VIs) that take advantage of vegetation reï¬‚ectance contrasts between wavebands/wavelengths 
 <xref rid="pone.0067315-PenaBarragan1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. VIs based on multi-spectral broad bands are commonly used to enhance vegetation differentiation 
 <xref rid="pone.0067315-Koger1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0067315-Hansen1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, but as an influence of phonology, the effectiveness of different VIs may also change with time. Recently, a few studies have taken advantages of phenology for species discrimination 
 <xref rid="pone.0067315-PenaBarragan1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0067315-Best1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Nevertheless, few studies concern multi-phonological spectra of saltmarsh vegetation, especially identifying the widespread invasive species, perhaps because of the difficult accessibility of saltmarsh environments for multi-date investigations. However, such work could provide important information guiding future field spectra sampling and remote sensing image collection.
