<p>The Yangtze River Estuary is an important eco-region that covers the main part of Shanghai and a portion of Jiangsu province, China. There are more than 300 km
 <sup>2</sup> of coastal saltmarshes in Shanghai alone that cover 22.5% of its total area and 95.7% of its total wetland area and provide more than 95% of its total value of ecosystem service ($7.3×10
 <sup>9</sup> US/year) 
 <xref rid="pone.0067315-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. However, one recent event, i.e., the 
 <italic>Spartina alterniflora</italic> (hereafter, 
 <italic>Spartina</italic>) invasion, has caused profound impacts on the saltmarshes 
 <xref rid="pone.0067315-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> invasion to the Yangtze River Estuary will likely converse mudflats to 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> meadows, destroy shorebirds’ foraging habitats, bring negative impacts on endangered species, decrease abundance of native species, and cause ecosystem degradation and considerable economic loss and the expanding trend is still not controlled 
 <xref rid="pone.0067315-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. These negative impacts of 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> invasion as well as its wide and dynamic distribution have posed an urgent task to get its spatial information accurately and timely in order to conserve native biodiversity and manage the land ecologically.
