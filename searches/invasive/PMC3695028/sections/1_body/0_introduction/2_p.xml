<p>Techniques of both multi-spectral and hyper-spectral remote sensing have been used to monitor and map saltmarsh vegetation. However, to monitor invasive plant species, the ability to map vegetation at monospecific level is required and thus we have the problems such as different spectra for the same vegetation type, the same spectra for different vegetation types, and mixed pixels that should be minimized. Hyper-spectral sensors with contiguous and narrow bands are able to detect small and local variations which are likely masked within broad bands of multi-spectral data; thus, hyper-spectral data can increase the potential to discriminate vegetation species and have successfully mapped wetland monospecific vegetation covers

On the other hand, though the old generation multi-spectral data such as Landsat TM and SPOT imageries were reported to be insufficient for mapping monospecific covers in detailed wetland environments due to mixed pixels resulting from coarse spatial resolution
