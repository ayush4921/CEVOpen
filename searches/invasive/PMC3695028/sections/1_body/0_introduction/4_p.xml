<p>This study aims to find out the most appropriate periods and corresponding spectral zones for mapping 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> by remote sensing in the Yangtze River Estuary. We hope the expected information would help collect, process, and classify images at suitable periods for dynamically monitoring 
 <italic>Spartina</italic>. To achieve this, spectral analyses were applied at multi phonological stages by sampling spectral curves into hyper−/multi-spectral bands, calculating VIs, and quantifying the spectral differences at each pure band and VI for comparison. More specifically, the objectives of this study were: 1) to characterize the canopy spectral properties of dominant saltmarsh species in different phenological stages and 2) (the more important) to identify the most suitable phenological stages to discriminate invasive exotic 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> and simultaneously determine the corresponding best separable hyper−/multi-spectral bands and VIs.
