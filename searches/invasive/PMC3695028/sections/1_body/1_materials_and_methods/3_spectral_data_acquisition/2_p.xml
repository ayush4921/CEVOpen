<p>Four patches (larger than 10 m×10 m) with similar vegetation height and coverage were selected for each plant species to decrease multi-factors interaction and influence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067315-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Three random sites were taken in each patch (sometimes, only in three patches) for spectral data collection and 20 spectrometer measurements were taken from each site at nadir points. The sensor was placed above plant canopies at approximately 100 cm height using a 20°FOV optic, which resulted in approximately 0.34 m spatial resolution (
