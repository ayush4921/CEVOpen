<p>Spectral data of dominated plants was collected 
 <italic>in situ</italic> using a UniSpec-DC Spectral Analysis System (PP System, Inc. Amesbury, MA, USA). This machine has a detection region of 310∼1 100 nm with optional FOVs of 3°, 6°, 12°, and 20°. The field work was initially planned to be done in 2009. However, limited by weather and tidal conditions, the data in some expected periods was missed in 2009. To fill the data gaps, the missing phenological stages were re-surveyed in 2010. In total, the spectra data was collected on 12 different dates at various phenological stages under clear weather between 10∶00 and 14∶00 (
