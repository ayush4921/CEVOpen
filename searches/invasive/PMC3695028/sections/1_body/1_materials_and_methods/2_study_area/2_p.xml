<p>The saltmarshes of Dongtan were dominated by native plant species 
 <italic>Phragmites australis</italic> (hereafter, 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic>) and 
 <italic>Scirpus mariqueter</italic> (hereafter, 
 <italic>Scirpus</italic>) before the invasion of 
 <italic>Spartina</italic>, and they create a good habitat and provide abundant food for various birds. However, the invasion of 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> is seriously threatening the native ecosystem and coastal aquaculture, and the native species are rapidly being replaced by 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> since it is introduced in 2001 for land reclamation
