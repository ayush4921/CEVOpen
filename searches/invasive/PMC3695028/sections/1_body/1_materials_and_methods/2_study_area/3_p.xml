<p>The phenology of the three presently dominated species is somewhat different 
 <xref rid="pone.0067315-Yan1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Generally, 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> germinates in early April, undergoes a rapid vegetative growth stage spanning from June to mid-August, flowers in mid-October, and senesces in late-November. 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> emerges in early-May, grows rapidly from June to early-September, flowers in late-September, and dies in late-December. 
 <italic>Scirpus</italic> has a relatively shorter lifespan than 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> or 
 <italic>Spartina</italic>. It usually begins to grow in late-April, turns to flowering stage in mid-June, and starts withering process in early-September. These differences in phenology may greatly affect the distinctive spectral signatures between the species, making some periods during a year more likely than others to discriminate them using remote sensing technology.
