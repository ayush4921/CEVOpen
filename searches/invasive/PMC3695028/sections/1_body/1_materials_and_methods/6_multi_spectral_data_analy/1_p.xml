<p>To estimate how 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> is separable from 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> and 
 <italic>Scirpus</italic> by multi-spectral remote sensing on different days, the same process as in a hyper-spectral analysis was applied to calculate the statistical difference and JM distance between each pair of plant species based on multi-spectral broad bands (B, G, R, NIR) and the commonly used VIs of NDVI, RVI, RB, VNVI, ANVI, EVI).
