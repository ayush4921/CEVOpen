<p>One advantage of JM distance over other measurements of statistical separability, such as divergence, is that an upper bound of error probability for classification could be estimated 
 <xref rid="pone.0067315-Swain1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. According to the estimated error probability, the separability of statistically different hyper-spectral bands was classified into four categories: perfect-separability (error probability &lt;1%), good -separability (1% ≤ error probability &lt;7%), normal-separability (7% ≤ error probability &lt;14%), and poor-separability (error probability ≥14%). The formula for computing the JM distance and the error probability (
