<p>To estimate how 
 <italic>Spartina</italic> is separable from 
 <italic>Phragmites</italic> and 
 <italic>Scirpus</italic> by using hyper-spectral remote sensing on different days, the statistical difference and separability of the hyper-spectral bands between plant species were calculated. First, the Mann-Whitney U-test was employed on the 5 nm-wide bands between every pair of vegetation types and the significance level was &lt;0.05. The null hypothesis assumes that there is no significant difference of the same 5 nm-wide band between one type and another. If this null hypothesis was rejected, the alternative hypothesis was that they are significantly different. The significantly different bands suggested the potential to discriminate plant species, but in order to compare the discrimination ability, itâ€™ d better to quantify how far they are in the statistical spaces (the spectral separability).
