 <caption> Maximum photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) and reactive oxygen species. Fv/Fm of detached leaves at 0 and 5 h ( A, B). Proline content in detached leaves ( C). Malondialdehyde (MDA) content of detached leaves at 0 and 5 h ( D). Accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (DAB) and superoxide cation (NBT) in detached leaves at 0 and 5 h ( E, F). The data are shown as means ± standard errors (SE), and the study included five biological replicates. Different letters (a, b, c, d) on the bar represent significant differences at p &lt; 0.05 (Duncan’s test). </caption>
