<p>The total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of leaves was evaluated by measuring the rate of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-09-01227" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In this procedure, 0.05 g leaves were cut into pieces and placed in a centrifuge tube containing 1.5 mL 95% methanol and extracted at 4 °C for 24 h. The 0.3 mL sample was mixed with 2.7 mL 120 μM DPPH. The absorbance was measured at 517 nm (
 <italic>UV-2450</italic>, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), and the concentration was calculated according to the standard curve of DPPH.
