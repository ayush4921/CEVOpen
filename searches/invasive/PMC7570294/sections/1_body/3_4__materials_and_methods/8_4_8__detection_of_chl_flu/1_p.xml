<p>Chl fluorescence was measured by the Chl fluorescence imaging system (Technologica, Essex, UK). The minimum fluorescence (F0) and the maximum fluorescence (Fm) of the leaves and stems were measured using a 6000 μmol m
 <sup>−2</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup> saturating pulse. The maximum photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) was calculated as Fv/Fm = (Fm − F0)/Fm [
