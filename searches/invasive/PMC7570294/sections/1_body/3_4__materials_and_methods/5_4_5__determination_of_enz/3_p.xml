<p>The activity of SOD was evaluated according to the method published by Giannopolitis and Ries [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-09-01227" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], with moderate adjustments. In total, 0.1 mL of the enzyme extract was mixed with 1.7 mL phosphate buffer (50 mM; pH 7.8), 0.3 mL methionine (130 mM), 0.3 mL NBT (0.75 mM), 0.3 mL EDTA-Na
 <sub>2</sub> (0.1 mM), and 0.3 mL riboflavin (0.02 mM). The reaction was conducted at a photosynthetic photon flux density of 4500 Lux for 15 min. Subsequently, the absorbance was determined immediately at 560 nm (
 <italic>UV-2450</italic>, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) after the reaction was terminated in the dark. The amount of enzyme that resulted in 50% suppression of the photochemical reduction in NBT was defined as the unit of enzyme activity.
