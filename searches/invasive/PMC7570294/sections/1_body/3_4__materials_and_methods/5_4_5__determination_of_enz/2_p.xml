<p>The activity of POD was evaluated according to the method described by Chance and Maehly [
 <xref rid="B40-plants-09-01227" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], with moderate adjustments. In total, 0.1 mL of the enzyme extract was mixed with 1.875 mL phosphate buffer (50 mM; pH 7.0), 1 mL H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (30 mM), and 0.025 mL 2-methoxyphenol. The absorbance was recorded nine times (20 s each time) at 470 nm (
