<p>The activity of CAT was evaluated according to the method described by Chance and Maehly [
 <xref rid="B40-plants-09-01227" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], with moderate adjustments. A total of 0.1 mL of the enzyme extract was mixed with 2.9 mL H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (30 mM). After 15 s of incubation, the absorbance was recorded nine times (20 s each time) at 240 nm (
 <italic>UV-2450</italic>, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The activity of CAT (1 unit) was estimated as the quantity of enzyme needed for a 0.01-unit increase in the optical density (OD) within 1 min.
