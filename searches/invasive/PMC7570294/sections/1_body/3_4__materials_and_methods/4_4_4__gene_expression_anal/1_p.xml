<p>The analysis of gene expression was conducted according to the method published by Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-plants-09-01227" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Normalization and fold changes were calculated using the methods of Livak and Schmittgen [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-09-01227" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The 
 <italic>GAPDH</italic> gene was used as an internal reference; the primer pairs were 5′-CTGCTTCATTCAACATC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTCACGGTCAGATCAACA-3′ (reverse). The primer pairs for the 
 <italic>ABA1</italic> gene were 5′-AACCGAGTCTCCAAGCAAGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCAGGTAGAAAGGAACGGCT-3′ (reverse). The primer pairs for the 
 <italic>NCED</italic> gene were 5′-ACGTCGTTTTCCTGCGAGAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCATGGGAAGAACCCGATCA-3′ (reverse). The primer pairs for the 
 <italic>PIP</italic> gene were 5′-GCTCCCAAGCCTCAGGAAAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTCCGGAATGGCAGGTGTTT-3′ (reverse).
