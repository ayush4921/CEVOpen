<p>The MDA was measured according to the method published by Sun et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-09-01227" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A 0.2 g sample was homogenized with 2 mL 10% trichloroacetic acid. After centrifuging at 4000× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant (1 mL) was mixed with an equal volume of 0.67% 2-thiobarbituric acid and then boiled for 20 min. The absorbance of the solution was measured after cooling at 600, 532, and 450 nm using a 
 <italic>UV-2450</italic> spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan).
