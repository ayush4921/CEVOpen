<p>The flavonoids were determined according to the method described by Heimler et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-09-01227" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In this procedure, 0.05 g leaves were cut into pieces and placed in a centrifuge tube containing 1.5 mL 95% methanol and extracted at 4 Â°C for 24 h. The 0.15 mL sample was mixed with 1.85 mL deionized water, 0.2 mL 5% NaNO
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.3 mL 10% AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> (freshly prepared), and 1 mL 1 M NaOH. The absorbance was measured at 510 nm (
