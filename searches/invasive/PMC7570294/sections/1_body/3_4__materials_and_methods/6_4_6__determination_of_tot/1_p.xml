<p>The total phenols were determined by the Folin–Ciocalteu method, as described by Ainsworth and Gillespie [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-09-01227" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In the procedure, 0.05 g leaves were cut into pieces and placed in a centrifuge tube containing 1.5 mL 95% methanol and extracted at 4 °C for 24 h. Then, 1 mL 10% Folin–Ciocalteu and 2 mL 0.7 M Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> were mixed and added to a 0.5 mL sample. The absorbance was measured at 765 nm (
