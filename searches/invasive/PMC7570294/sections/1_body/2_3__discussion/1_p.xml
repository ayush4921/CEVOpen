<p>The hybrid leaves showed no heterosis in controlling water loss. As the main organ of water loss in plants, most of the water is lost through leaves. Therefore, the ability of plant leaves to control water loss can reflect the drought resistance of plants. In this paper, the water loss rate of detached leaves of 
 <italic>W. chinensis</italic>, 
 <italic>W. trilobata</italic>, and their hybrid was compared. The results showed that the water loss rate of leaves of 
 <italic>W. trilobata</italic> was the lowest, and that of leaves of 
 <italic>W. chinensis</italic> was the highest. The water loss rate of hybrid leaves was between that of their parents, and it was closer to that of 
 <italic>W. chinensis</italic>. The phenotype of detached leaves showed that 
 <italic>W. chinensis</italic> leaves wilted first. Water loss in leaves mainly occurs through the stomata on the leaves, and the stomatal opening is positively correlated with the water loss of plants. Studies have shown that under drought stress, plants will reduce stomatal opening or close stomata to reduce water loss and improve drought resistance [

 <xref rid="B25-plants-09-01227" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Many studies have shown that ABA plays a key role in stomatal regulation. The exogenous application of ABA or endogenous increase in ABA expression can cause stomata to close, thus reducing water loss [

 <xref rid="B27-plants-09-01227" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The results showed that the ABA content of detached leaves increased significantly, and that of 
 <italic>W. trilobata</italic> was significantly higher than that of 
 <italic>W. chinensis</italic> and hybrids, which was consistent with the results of water loss. In 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, it was found that the overexpression of ABA synthesis-related genes could increase the ABA content in leaves, reduce the water loss of detached leaves, and improve the drought resistance of plants [

 <italic>ABA1</italic> and 
 <italic>NCED</italic> are the main regulatory genes in the ABA synthesis pathway, and their expression levels are positively correlated with the ABA content. In 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, drought can increase the expression of 
 <italic>NCED</italic> and the content of ABA. Compared with wild type specimens, the ABA content in ABA-deficient mutants decreased, and drought resistance decreased under drought stress [

 <xref rid="B29-plants-09-01227" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The results of this study showed that the expression of 
 <italic>ABA1</italic> and 
 <italic>NCED</italic> in detached leaves increased significantly. The expression level of 
 <italic>ABA1</italic> and 
 <italic>NCED</italic> in 
 <italic>W. trilobata</italic> was the highest, and that in 
 <italic>W. chinensis</italic> was the lowest. 
 <italic>PIP</italic> is a key gene in the synthesis of aquaporin. The increase in 
 <italic>PIP</italic> expression can increase the content of aquaporin. Aquaporin is the most important aquaporin on the cell membrane, and can affect the water transport and regulation between cells. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01227-f002">Figure 2</xref> shows that the 
 <italic>PIP</italic> expression increased significantly, which was consistent with 
 <italic>ABA1</italic> and 
 <italic>NCED</italic> expression. Studies have shown that increasing the content of aquaporin in leaves can improve the drought resistance of plants [
