<p>In the long-term evolution of plants, the mechanism of stress adaptation is restricted by heredity. On the one hand, plants scavenge reactive oxygen radicals by enhancing the activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, and POD), in order to maintain the stability and integrity of the cell membrane [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-09-01227" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The results showed that the activities of SOD, CAT, and POD in detached leaves of 
 <italic>W. chinensis</italic>, 
 <italic>W. trilobata</italic>, and their hybrid increased significantly. Among them, the enzyme activity in the leaves of 
 <italic>W. trilobata</italic> was the strongest, the enzyme activity in the leaves of 
 <italic>W. chinensis</italic> was the weakest, and the enzyme activity in the leaves of the hybrid was between that of its parents. A previous study showed that increasing the activities of SOD, CAT, and POD could significantly reduce the accumulation of ROS in plant leaves [

 <italic>W. chinensis</italic>, 
 <italic>W. trilobata</italic>, and their hybrid increased significantly, and the trend was consistent with enzyme activity.
