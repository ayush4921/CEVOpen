<p>Biological invasion has become increasingly common. In the process of biological invasion, the phenomenon of hybridization between invasive species and native species often occurs. Interspecific hybridization is a common phenomenon in plants. It has been reported that at least 25% of plant species have undergone hybridization or gene penetration with other species [

Hybridization between native and invasive species usually results in new species, which leads to genetic variation, a fixation of heterosis, and a reduction in the genetic load, thus promoting the evolution of invasiveness and adaptability [

The hybridization between native species and invasive species will reduce the genetic diversity and population diversity of native species, especially for endangered species. Sometimes, the diffusion of hybrids will reduce the biomass of native species and even cause the extinction of native species [
