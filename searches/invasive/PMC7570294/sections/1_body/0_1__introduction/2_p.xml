<p>In the face of drought stress, plants have formed a series of strategies, the first of which is to reduce water loss. Most water loss (transpiration) is produced through stomata. Therefore, reducing stomatal opening or closing is key to reducing water loss under drought conditions [

The ability of osmoregulation is considered to be among the criteria for the drought resistance of plants. There are many osmoregulants in plant cells, among which proline is the most studied so far. A large amount of data has shown that there is a positive correlation between proline accumulation and plant drought stress [

Aerobic metabolism provides energy for plant growth and development, but it is also accompanied by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [
 <xref rid="B4-plants-09-01227" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Under ROS stress, the spatial structures of various membrane proteins or enzymes are disturbed, resulting in an increased membrane permeability and ion leakage, chlorophyll damage, metabolic disorders, and even serious injury or death of plants. In order to protect cells from the harmful effects of excessive ROS, plants have evolved a series of complex enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant defense mechanisms to maintain the homeostasis of the intracellular redox state. Protective enzymes include superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POD). Nonenzymatic antioxidants include vitamins, phenols, and ketones. Under drought stress, the content of antioxidants in plants increases significantly [
