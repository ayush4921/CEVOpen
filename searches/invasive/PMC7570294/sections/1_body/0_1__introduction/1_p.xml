<p>In the process of plant growth, organisms are subjected to various adverse environmental stresses, among which drought is one of the most common abiotic stresses. The effects of drought stress on plants are mainly reflected in the effects on cell activity and organ and tissue function [

A large number of reactive oxygen species will damage the properties of the cell membrane. The results of membrane lipid peroxidation are mainly an increase in the malondialdehyde (MDA) content and an increase in the cell membrane permeability [

Due to the destruction of the cell membrane and the increase in the permeability, the cell membrane will lose the function of selective passage, resulting in uncontrolled material passing in and out of the cell, resulting in the disorder of the cell metabolic function.
