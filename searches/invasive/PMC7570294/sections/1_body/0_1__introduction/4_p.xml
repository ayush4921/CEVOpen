 <italic>Wedelia trilobata</italic> (L.) Pruski and 
 <italic>Wedelia chinensis</italic> (Osbeck) Merr. belong to the 
 <italic>Asteraceae</italic> family. They are creeping perennial herbal plants found in South America and South China. A hybrid of 
 <italic>W. trilobata</italic> and 
 <italic>W. chinensis</italic> was identified in the wild in 2013 [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-09-01227" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A previous study showed that the response of the hybrid to nitrogen deposition and the tolerance of the hybrid to weak light and low temperature stress have no heterosis compared with its parents [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-09-01227" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-plants-09-01227" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Our recent research demonstrated that hybridization between 
 <italic>W. trilobata</italic> and 
 <italic>W. chinensis</italic> significantly improved the tolerance of the hybrid to cadmium stress [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-09-01227" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, the stress tolerance of this hybrid to drought stress exposure remains largely unknown. The leaf is the most important organ of water loss in plants. This study aimed to investigate the water loss rate of detached leaves of 
 <italic>W. chinensis</italic>, 
 <italic>W. trilobata</italic>, and their hybrid.
