<p>In summary, the ability of the hybrid of 
 <italic>W. trilobata</italic> and 
 <italic>W. chinensis</italic> to control water loss in leaves was weaker than that of the invasive species 
 <italic>W. trilobata</italic>, but stronger than that of the native species 
 <italic>W. chinensis</italic>. In the process of leaf water loss, the water loss rate of 
 <italic>W. trilobata</italic> was the lowest, and that of 
 <italic>W. chinensis</italic> was the highest. The antioxidant capacity of 
 <italic>W. trilobata</italic> was the strongest, while that of 
 <italic>W. chinensis</italic> was the weakest. 
 <italic>W. chinensis</italic> suffered the most serious oxidative stress, while 
 <italic>W. trilobata</italic> suffered the least. The results indicate that the drought resistance of the hybrid is not superior to that of its parents but is stronger than that of the native species. The survival of native species is threatened not only by invasive species but also by hybrids. Therefore, the emergence of hybrids may accelerate the extinction of native species.
