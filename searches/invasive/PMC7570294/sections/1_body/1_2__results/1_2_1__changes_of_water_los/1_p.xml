<p>The leaf phenotype showed that the leaves of 
 <italic>W. chinensis</italic>, 
 <italic>W. trilobata</italic>, and their hybrid exhibited wilting with the prolongation of the leaf in vitro time, among which the 
 <italic>W. chinensis</italic> displayed the most obvious performance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01227-f001">Figure 1</xref>A,B), and the leaf edge angle had curled at 3 h (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01227-f001">Figure 1</xref>C shows the changes of leaf water loss for the three plants. With the extension of the in vitro time, the water loss rate of leaves of 
 <italic>W. chinensis</italic> was the highest, and that of 
 <italic>W. trilobata</italic> was the lowest. The water loss rate of hybrid leaves was between those of its parents.
