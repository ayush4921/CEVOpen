<p>In detached leaves, the maximal photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) of 
 <italic>W. chinensis</italic> leaves was the lowest, and that of 
 <italic>W. trilobata</italic> was the highest (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01227-f003">Figure 3</xref>A,B). Proline, as an osmoregulation substance, can regulate the osmotic pressure of cells, and the proline content of detached leaves increased (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01227-f003">Figure 3</xref>C). MDA is a product of membrane lipid peroxidation, which can reflect the degree of cell membrane damage. The content of MDA in leaves increased significantly, among which 
 <italic>W. chinensis</italic> had the highest content, increasing by 194%, while 
 <italic>W. trilobata</italic> had the lowest content, with an increase of 32%. The content of the hybrid was between that of its parents, increasing by 108% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01227-f003">Figure 3</xref>D). It was found that the accumulation of ROS in detached leaves increased, and the accumulation of ROS in leaves of 
 <italic>W. trilobata</italic> was the lowest (
