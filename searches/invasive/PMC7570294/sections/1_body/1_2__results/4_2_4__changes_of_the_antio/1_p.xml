<p>Plants can reduce oxidative stress in cells by synthesizing antioxidants. The contents of SOD, CAT, and POD were increased significantly in detached leaves. The contents of SOD, CAT, and POD in 
 <italic>W. trilobata</italic> were the highest, and those of 
 <italic>W. chinensis</italic> were the lowest (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01227-f004">Figure 4</xref>Aâ€“C). Total phenols and flavonoids were nonenzymatic antioxidants, and their contents also increased significantly in detached leaves (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01227-f004">Figure 4</xref>D,E). Furthermore, the trend was consistent with SOD, CAT, and POD. The total antioxidant capacity (TAC) reflected the antioxidant capacity of nonenzymatic antioxidants. The content of total antioxidant substances in the leaves of 
 <italic>W. trilobata</italic> was significantly higher than that of the hybrid, and that of the hybrid was higher than that of 
 <italic>W. chinensis</italic> (
