<p>The ABA content of detached leaves increased significantly. The ABA content of 
 <italic>W. trilobata</italic> was significantly higher than that of 
 <italic>W. chinensis</italic> and its hybrid. The content of ABA increased by 43%, 207%, and 51% in 
 <italic>W. chinensis</italic>, 
 <italic>W. trilobata</italic>, and their hybrid, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01227-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). 
 <italic>ABA1</italic> and 
 <italic>NCED</italic> are the main regulatory genes in the ABA synthesis pathway. The relative expression levels of 
 <italic>ABA1</italic> and 
 <italic>NCED</italic> in detached leaves were significantly up-regulated, and their trend was consistent (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01227-f002">Figure 2</xref>B,C). The results showed that the relative expression of 
 <italic>ABA1</italic> and 
 <italic>NCED</italic> in the leaves of 
 <italic>W. trilobata</italic> was significantly higher than that of hybrids, and that of hybrids was significantly higher than that of 
 <italic>W. chinensis</italic>. 
 <italic>PIP</italic> is a key gene in the synthesis of aquaporin, and the relative expression of the 
 <italic>PIP</italic> gene in detached leaves also increased significantly (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01227-f002">Figure 2</xref>D). Moreover, the trend was consistent with that of 
 <italic>ABA1</italic> and 
 <italic>NCED</italic>.
