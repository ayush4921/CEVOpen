    "In the process of biological invasion, hybridization between invasive species and native species is very common, which may lead to the formation of hybrids with a stronger adaptability. The hybrid of <i>Wedelia trilobata</i> (an alien invasive species) and <i>Wedelia chinensis</i> (an indigenous congener) has been found in South China. In our previous study, we found that the hybrid showed heterosis under cadmium stress. However, the results of this experiment demonstrated that the leaves of the hybrid had no heterosis in controlling water loss. The results showed that the water loss rate of <i>W. trilobata</i> was the slowest, that of <i>W. chinensis</i> was the fastest, and that of the hybrid was in the middle. Compared with <i>W. chinensis</i> and the hybrid, <i>W. trilobata</i> accumulated more abscisic acid (ABA) in leaves to control water loss. After the leaves were detached, <i>W. chinensis</i> leaves suffered the most serious damage, the lowest maximum photochemical efficiency, the most serious membrane lipid peroxidation, and the largest accumulation of malondialdehyde and reactive oxygen species. Compared with <i>W. chinensis</i> and its hybrid, the leaves of <i>W. trilobata</i> could accumulate more antioxidant enzymes and antioxidants, and the total antioxidant capacity was the strongest. The results demonstrate that the ability of the hybrid to reduce water loss was lower than that of <i>W. trilobata</i>, but higher than that of <i>W. chinensis</i>. They showed that the drought resistance of the hybrid may be higher than that of <i>W. chinensis</i>, and it might threaten the survival of <i>W. chinensis</i>."
