  <p>Infection analysis of seeds with different 
   <italic>A. flavus</italic> strains. (a) Host colonization of WT, ∆fab1 and ∆fab1::fab1 strains. Peanut seeds were inoculated with WT, ∆fab1 and ∆fab1::fab1 strains and cultured at 29°C for 7 days. (b) Conidia amounts produced from the infected peanut seeds. (c) TLC assay results for aflatoxin B
   <sub>1</sub> (AFB
   <sub>1</sub>) levels in extracts from infected peanut seeds. (d) MS analysis of aflatoxin production from infected peanut seeds. (e) Maize seeds were inoculated with WT, ∆fab1, or ∆fab1::fab1 strains and cultured at 29°C for 7 days. (f) Conidia amounts produced from the infected maize seeds. (g) TLC was used to detect the aflatoxin B
   <sub>1</sub> (AFB
   <sub>1</sub>) production in the infected maize seeds. (h) MS analysis of aflatoxin production from the infected maize seeds. Data are presented as means ±S.D. and represent the results of three independent experiments. **
