  <p>Fab1 identification and validation. (a) Domain analysis of Fab1 in different species. (b) Relative 
   <italic>fab1</italic> mRNA levels under different growth conditions. Data are presented as means ±S.D. and represent the results of three independent experiments. Statistically significant differences are indicated: *
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. (c) Validation of 
   <italic>fab1</italic> transcript quantification via northern blotting. (d) PCR validation of 
   <italic>fab1</italic> fragment clones by 3’RACE. The second round of PCR was performed with the gene-specific forward primers and the RACE adaptor primers. The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis. Fragment1 and Fragment2 are two independent biological replicates. (e) Sequencing validation of amplified fragment from 
   <italic>fab1</italic> by 3’RACE. The amplified fragment by 3’RACE included the splice site and ploy (A) of 
   <italic>fab1.</italic>
