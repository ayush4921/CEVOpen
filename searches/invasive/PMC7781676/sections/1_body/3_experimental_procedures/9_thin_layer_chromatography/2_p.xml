<p>Mass spectrometry was also used to detect aflatoxins. Briefly, the samples were analyzed by an ACQUITY H-Class UPLC system coupled to a Xevo TQ (Waters, Milford, MA). Aflatoxins were separated with an analytical C
 <sub>18</sub>-nanocapillary LC column (1.7 μm particle, 2.1 × 50 mm) and eluted with a linear gradient elution program as follows: 0–3 min, 15%-50% solvent B (0.1% formic acid/80% acetonitrile, v/v); 4–5 min, 50%-70%; 6.5–8 min, 70%-100%; 8–10 min, 100%-50%; 10–11 min, 50%-15%; 11–15 min, 15%; at 200 nL/min flow rate. The MS was operated in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. MS source conditions included a cone voltage optimized to 30 V, a capillary voltage set to 3 kV, collision energy set to 35 V, nitrogen gas flow at 50 L/h, a source temperature of 150°C, desolvation temperature at 350°C. Data was acquired using MassLynx 4.0. The precursor ions of aflatoxins (AFB
 <sub>1</sub> and AFB
 <sub>2</sub>) were set to 312.92 m/z and 314.78 m/z, respectively.
