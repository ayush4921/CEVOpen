<p>The YES and PDA media were point inoculated with 10
 <sup>5</sup> conidia and kept at 37°C for 5 days in dark to evaluate the growth rate. Then, the colony morphology was recorded and colony diameter was measured. After homogenization and dilution with distilled water, conidia amount was counted using a hemocytometer and a microscope as previously reported [
 <xref rid="cit0065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. For the sclerotia analysis, 10
 <sup>5</sup> conidia were inoculated on Yeast Peptone Dextrose (YPD) media and kept for 9 day at 37°C in the dark and the sclerotial formation was counted. In order to wash away conidia to aid in enumeration of the sclerotia, the plates were washed with 75% ethanol. Each experiment was carried out with three independent biological replicates.
