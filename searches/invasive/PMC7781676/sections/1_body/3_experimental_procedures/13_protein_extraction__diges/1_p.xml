<p>Protein lysates from WT and ∆fab1 strains were extracted and quantified as the protocol described in protein extraction section. We precipitated the lysate using 80% ice-cold acetone and then washed three times with ice-cold acetone to remove the pigment and other small molecules. The protein lysates were finally redissolved in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Equal amounts of protein extracts were then in-solution digested by trypsin (Promega) as previously described [
 <xref rid="cit0063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] and each sample was prepared with three biological replicates. After trypsin digestion, a total of 100 µg of each sample was further processed as the manufacturer’s protocol for TMT 6plex isobaric label kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The labeled peptides were mixed at equal amounts and desalted with C
 <sub>18</sub> (40 μm, 60-Å particle; Agilent Technologies) columns and dried with a vacuum centrifuge.
