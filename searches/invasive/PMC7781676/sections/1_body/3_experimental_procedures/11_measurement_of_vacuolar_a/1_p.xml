<p>The vacuolar and cytosolic pH values were measured as previously described [
 <xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Briefly, all 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> strains were cultured in YES media, and then collected and washed three times with PBS buffer to remove the media. The hyphal filaments were then resuspended in PBS buffer containing 50 µM BCECF-AM [2,7-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein-acetoxymethyl ester] fluorescent dye (GC14603, GLPBIO, Montclair, CA, USA) and incubated at 37°C for 20–30 min. After washing three times with PBS buffer, the fluorescence intensities from different stained hyphal filaments were quantified at the respective excitation/emission wavelengths of 450/535 and 490/535 nm for vacuolar fluorescence, while cytosolic fluorescence intensities were measured at the excitation wavelengths of 405 and 485 nm, with an emission wavelength of 508 nm using an automatic hybrid multi-mode microplate reader (Synergy H1, BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). The calibration curves for vacuolar and cytosolic pH were established according to previously described [
 <xref rid="cit0060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], and the vacuolar and cytosolic pH values were calculated based on the calibration equations: 
 <italic>y</italic> = −7.1084 + 1.8409
 <italic>x</italic> (
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9785, for vacuolar pH) and 
 <italic>y</italic> = −1.8817 + 0.4496
 <italic>x</italic> (
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9948, for cytosolic pH), where 
 <italic>y</italic> is the ratio and 
 <italic>x</italic> is pH value. Each treatment was performed with three independent biological replicates. Statistical comparisons were performed by Student’s 
 <italic>t</italic>-test.
