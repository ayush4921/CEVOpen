<p>A gene deletion mutant was constructed and confirmed by previously described methods [
 <xref rid="cit0064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Briefly, the upstream (
 <italic>AP</italic>) and downstream (
 <italic>BP</italic>) sequences of the 
 <italic>fab1</italic> gene, as well as the 
 <italic>pyrG</italic> gene of 
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> were fused into the interruption fragment (
 <italic>AP-pyrG-BP</italic>) using a fusion PCR strategy. The fused fragment was then transformed into 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> CA14 PTs protoplasts to construct the 
 <italic>fab1</italic> deletion strain (∆fab1). For the construction of the complementary strain, 
 <italic>fab1</italic> gene with its upstream promoter region was firstly cloned into the pPTRI vector (Takara) and the recombinant plasmid was then transformed into the ∆fab1 mutant protoplasts to construct the complementary strain (∆fab1::fab1). All mutant and complementary strains were confirmed by PCR and sequencing.
