<p>The same protein extracts derived from quantitative proteomics were tryptic digested as previously described [
 <xref rid="cit0063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Each experiment was carried out with three independent biological replicates. The digested peptides were separated on an online nano-flow EASY-nLC 1000 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a gradient of 7–25% solvent B (90% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid, v/v) over 40 min, 25%-35% in 8 min, 35%-80% in 4 min and holding at 80% for the last 4 min at 350 nL/min flow rate.
