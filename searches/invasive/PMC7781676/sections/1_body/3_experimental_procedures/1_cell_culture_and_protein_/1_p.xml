<p>All 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> strains used in this study are given in 
 <bold>Table S8</bold>. 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> was cultured on liquid yeast extract-sucrose agar (YES) and potato dextrose agar (PDA) and the 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> were then grown under several conditions. For the low temperature and pH stresses, 10
 <sup>6</sup> conidia were resuspended in fresh YES media at 29°C or YES media (pH 5, with hydrochloride) at 37°C. For the oxidative and hyperosmotic stresses, 10
 <sup>6</sup> conidia were resuspended in fresh YES media containing additional H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (0.8 M) or sodium chloride (1 M), respectively.
