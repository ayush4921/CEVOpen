<p>The metal ions in 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> were assayed by staining with the Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>-specific fluorescence dye Fura-2-AM (Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester, 40702ES50, Yeasen, Shanghai, China), Na
 <sup>+</sup>-specific fluorescence dye SBFI-AM (sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate acetoxymethyl ester, GC44876, GLPBIO, Montclair, CA, USA) and K
 <sup>+</sup>-specific fluorescence dye PBFI-AM (potassium-binding benzofuran isophthalate acetoxymethyl ester, GC18477, GLPBIO, Montclair, CA, USA) as previous reports [
 <xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36–39</xref>]. All 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> strains were cultured in YES media, then collected and washed three times with PBS buffer to remove the media. The hyphal filaments were resuspended in PBS buffer containing 10 mM fluorescence dyes (Fura-2-AM, SBFI-AM, or PBFI-AM) and incubated at 37°C for 20–30 min. After washing three times with PBS buffer, the fluorescence intensities from the different stained hyphal filaments were measured at excitation wavelengths of 340/380 nm and an emission wavelength of 505 nm by using a Synergy H1 Hybrid Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT). The relative metal ions concentrations in different hyphal filaments were calculated based on the ratio of fluorescence intensity after dual-wavelength excitation. The unstained strains were used as controls. Each treatment was performed with three independent biological replicates. Statistical comparisons were performed by Student’s 
 <italic>t</italic>-test.
