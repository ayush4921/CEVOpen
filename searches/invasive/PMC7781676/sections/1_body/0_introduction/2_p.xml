<p>Recent studies have shown that fungal vacuoles/vesicles are versatile organelles, involved in regulating various cellular processes [
 <xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Mutations affecting vacuole function and vacuole membrane homeostasis can lead to defects in fungal virulence [
 <xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12â€“14</xref>]. In 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, mutations of a subset of vacuolar proteins affected hyphal morphogenesis, growth, and virulence [
 <xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Additionally, a lack of the vacuolar transport chaperone Vtc4 in 
 <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic> significantly decreased its virulence on maize [
 <xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and deletion of the vesicle-vacuole fusion protein Vb1 influences aflatoxin synthesis in 
 <italic>A. parasiticus</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Notably, previous efforts have focused on the role of vacuoles and vesicles in the secondary metabolism of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], suggesting that a functional vacuole plays an important role in fungal growth and virulence. However, very little is known about the regulatory mechanism of vacuoles in regulating 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> metabolism, particularly the functions of vacuole-related genes.
