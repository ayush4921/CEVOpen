 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> (
 <italic>A. flavus</italic>) is one of the most important species in the 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> genus because it can cause both noninvasive and invasive systematic aspergillosis in immunocompromised individuals, animals and economically important crops [
 <xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> produces a range of potent carcinogens and toxins collectively known as aflatoxins, creating concerns regarding their potential for environmental contamination [
 <xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of food samples collected between 2007 and 2012 were estimated to contain aflatoxins [
 <xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. When these foods are ingested or when 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> is able to grow without immunological constraint, acute toxicity in addition to a long-term increase in cancer risk can occur in affected individuals [
 <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Owing to the economic and food safety issues in agriculture and medicine, much attention has been directed at the study of aflatoxin synthesis and pathway regulation through the genetics, molecular biology and biochemistry methods. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of aflatoxin biosynthesis and pathway regulation will enable the development of innovative approaches for reducing aflatoxin production in important agricultural crops and human exposure to aflatoxins in populations at high risk for aflatoxicosis. Although a wide variety of factors can induce or inhibit aflatoxin synthesis in 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6â€“10</xref>], the detailed regulatory mechanisms controlling aflatoxin production in 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> are still fragmentary.
