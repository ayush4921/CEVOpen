<p>To further investigate the function of Fab1-regulated proteins, we next explored the biological roles of the proteins based upon their gene ontology (GO) functional annotations. A large portion of these proteins were associated with “metabolic processes,” including phosphorus metabolism. As Fab1 appears to be associated with the vacuolar and pre-vacuolar compartments, and is a key regulator of vacuolar membrane homeostasis in 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic>, it is perhaps unsurprising that these Fab1-regulated proteins were involved in transport and stress-response activities (

 <bold>and Table S3</bold>). Consistent with such roles, most of these proteins were found in the cytoplasm, cell membrane, and endoplasmic reticulum (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0008">Figure 8(a</xref>) 
 <bold>and Table S3</bold>). Over 50 up-regulated DEPs were located on the integral component of the membrane, further indicating the importance of Fab1 in normal membrane homeostasis. Further enrichment analyses demonstrated that these DEPs were significantly enriched in metabolic processes, including metabolism of secondary metabolite glycerolipids and the metabolism of glycerophospholipid (
 <bold>Table S4</bold>). Interestingly, we also observed enrichment for the protein export, peroxisome, and MAPK signaling pathways, supporting a role for Fab1 in counteracting stress, due to the disruption of vacuolar/cellular homeostasis (
