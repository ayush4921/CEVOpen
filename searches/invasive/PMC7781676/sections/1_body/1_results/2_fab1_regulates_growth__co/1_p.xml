<p>To elucidate the functional role of Fab1, we disrupted 
 <italic>fab1</italic> by gene replacement mutagenesis using a fusion PCR approach (
 <bold>Fig. S4A</bold>). Mutant (∆fab1) and complementation (∆fab1::fab1) strains of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> were generated and validated by PCR and sequencing (
 <bold>Fig. S4B</bold>). We also confirmed whether 
 <italic>fab1</italic> was expressed in these strains 
 <italic>via</italic> northern blotting (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1(c</xref>)). In order to verify the 
 <italic>fab1</italic> 3’ untranslated region (UTR), total 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> RNA was subjected to a 3’-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) experiment and the resultant 3’-RACE PCR product was sequenced to verify the splicing sites and poly(A) tail of 
 <italic>fab1</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1(d,e</xref>)).
