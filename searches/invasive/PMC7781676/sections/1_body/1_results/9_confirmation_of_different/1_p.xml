<p>Owing to the high sensitivity and robustness, parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) has recently emerged as the “gold standard” MS technique for targeted proteomic approaches, which are routinely used for quantitative analysis of targeted proteins [

 <xref rid="cit0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. To independently validate our quantitative results, we next conducted a PRM assay for 15 of the identified DEPs. Most of the selected DEPs were represented by either one or two unique peptides, with 28 total peptides represented (
 <bold>Table S6</bold>). Relative to the WT strain, five of these DEPs were down-regulated and the remaining 10 were significantly upregulated in the ∆fab1 strain (
 <bold>Fig. S9B and Table S7</bold>). The PRM analysis revealed results nearly identical to our TMT-based analysis, confirming quality and quantitative accuracy of our MS data.
