<p>The synthesis of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate by Fab1 on the vacuole has the potential to mediate homeostatic regulation of the vacuolar membrane and to regulate proximal ion channels within these vacuoles [
 <xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As such, we hypothesized that vacuolar dysregulation arising as a result of the loss of 
 <italic>fab1</italic> would result in impaired aflatoxin export. To test this hypothesis, we assessed aflatoxin production via thin layer chromatography (TLC) and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. TLC analyses indicated markedly reduced aflatoxin B
 <sub>1</sub> production from the ∆fab1 strain relative to from the WT and ∆fab1::fab1 strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2(e</xref>)), with the levels reduced by &gt;10-fold relative to the WT strain (
 <bold>Fig. S5G</bold>). We then validated this result via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to a Xevo TQ MS machine. This analysis confirmed that only trace levels of aflatoxin B
 <sub>1</sub> were detectable and minimal aflatoxin B
 <sub>2</sub> was evident in the ∆fab1 strain, whereas normal production of these aflatoxins was observed for the WT and ∆fab1::fab1 strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2(f</xref>) 
 <bold>and Fig. S5H</bold>). This thus further suggested that Fab1 was likely to influence the biosynthesis of aflatoxins and their consequent export by controlling vacuolar membrane homeostasis.
