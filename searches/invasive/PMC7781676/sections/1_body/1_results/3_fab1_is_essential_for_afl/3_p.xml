<p>It has been reported that enzymes involved in aflatoxin biosynthesis including Nor-1, Ver-1, and OmtA are localized to the vacuoles and vesicles in 
 <italic>A. parasiticus</italic> [
 <xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesized that 
 <italic>fab1</italic> deletion would similarly impact aflatoxin biosynthesis in 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic>. By staining these cells with neutral red dye, while we observed normal vesicle formation in the WT strain, we saw no vesicles formation in ∆fab1 cells when grown on aflatoxin-inducing medium (YES) for 3 days (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4(a</xref>) 
 <bold>and B</bold>). To further confirm this finding, we isolated the vesicle-vacuole fraction from 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> cells as previously described [
 <xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We then performed TLC to measure aflatoxin levels in these subcellular fractions, further confirming that 
 <italic>fab1</italic> deletion led to a near total loss of aflatoxin levels in this vesicle-vacuole fraction. Our results suggested that aflatoxins biosynthesis and transport may be disrupted in the ∆fab1 strain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4(c</xref>) 
 <bold>and Fig. S6</bold>). This same finding was also evident in the cytosolic and secreted fractions obtained from these cells. Based on these findings and previous reports, we, therefore, concluded that Fab1 is likely to play a central role in maintaining vacuolar/cellular homeostasis, with vacuolar dysregulation upon 
 <italic>fab1</italic> deletion leading to impaired aflatoxin synthesis, storage, and export, in agreement with previous reports [
 <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].
