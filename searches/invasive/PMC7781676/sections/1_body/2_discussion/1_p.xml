<p>Fungal vacuoles/vesicles play a crucial role in the regulation of various cellular processes. In this study, we identified a novel phosphoinositide kinase (Fab1) in the vacuole of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic>. Experimental evidence revealed that Fab1 was essential for the growth, development, cellular acidification and metal ion homeostasis, aflatoxin production and pathogenicity of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic>. Further functional studies of Fab1 suggested that this kinase plays a crucial role in the maintenance of vacuole size and cell morphology in this fungus. Our results provide insight into the mechanisms of aflatoxin synthesis and 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> pathogenicity, highlighting potential novel strategies for controlling aflatoxin contamination.
