<p>We examined the effects of latitude, initial patch size, climatic variables (PC1 and PC2), frequency of tropical storms, and frequency of hurricanes on growth rate of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> patches. Using general linear models in Systat 12 (Systat Inc., Chicago, IL), we developed statistical models using all combinations of latitude (
 <italic>x
  <sub>1</sub>
 </italic>), initial patch size (
 <italic>x
  <sub>2</sub>
 </italic>), PC1 (
 <italic>x
  <sub>3</sub>
 </italic>), PC2 (
 <italic>x
  <sub>4</sub>
 </italic>), frequencies of tropical storms (
 <italic>x
  <sub>5</sub>
 </italic>) and hurricanes (
 <italic>x
  <sub>6</sub>
 </italic>). The best model was selected using corrected Akaike weights 
 <xref rid="pone.0098478-Burnham1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0098478.s001">Table S1</xref>). The time interval over which 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> growth was measured for each site (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.11) and intensity of hurricanes (sum total of hurricane categories [1–5; Saffir-Simpson scale]) (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.71) did not have a significant effect on growth rates of patches. Therefore, we did not include them in analysis. Examination of the standardized residuals in our best model showed that one of the data points was an outlier (Intracoastal City, LA). Removal of that point in the analysis improved the fit of the model to the data (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>2,9</sub> = 36.53, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.89). Because we have no reason to conclude that this data point is spurious, we retained it in our analysis.
