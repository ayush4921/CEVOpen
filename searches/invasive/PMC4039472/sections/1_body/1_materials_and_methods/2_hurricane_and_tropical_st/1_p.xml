<p>We used wind speed as an indicator of the strength of the storm as a disturbance to 
 <italic>P. australis</italic>. Data on other disturbances associated with tropical storms and hurricanes (e.g., storm surge, change in salinity, nutrient levels, deposition of silt and wrack) are mostly unavailable. However, it is likely for coastal marshes that wind speed is correlated with these other variables.
