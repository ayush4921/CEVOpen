 <caption> Effect of hurricane frequency on P. australis growth. Annual growth rate (proportional change in ln area) of P. australis patches as a function of hurricane frequency in the coastal marshes of the United States. Filled and open symbols represent sites occupied by Eurasian and Gulf-Coast haplotypes respectively. Solid curve is the best-fit model representing all sites ( F 2,10 = 21.66, P&lt;0.001, R 2  = 0.81). The diamond-shaped symbol was identified as an outlier based on the examination of standardized residuals. The relationship was still significant when it was removed from the analysis ( P&lt;0.001, R 2 = 0.89). The dotted curve represents the best-fit model for only the sites occupied by the Eurasian haplotype ( F 2,6 = 26.87, P = 0.001, R = 0.90). </caption>
