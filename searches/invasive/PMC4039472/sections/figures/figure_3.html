 <caption> Relationship between the tropical storm and hurricane frequencies (number per year) and latitude. Filled and open symbols represent hurricane and tropical storm frequencies respectively. Lines for each storm category are fit by separate least-squares regression analyses (Tropical storms: R 2 = 0.16, P = 0.16; Hurricanes: R 2 = 0.55, P = 0.004). </caption>
