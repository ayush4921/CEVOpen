<p>We explored the efficacy of efforts to control a highly invasive plant species and to facilitate the restoration of native plant species richness to levels characteristic of uninvaded sites. When an appropriate sequence of sub-treatments is employed, Bitou Bush can be removed, re-invasion is limited, and native plant species can begin to recover. Critical to success is avoiding treatment sequences that may exacerbate invasive plant species problems. However, we also showed there can be value in taking advantage of unplanned events such as wildfires to deploy follow-up spraying to kill the pulse of seedlings likely to germinate after the fire (e.g. [
