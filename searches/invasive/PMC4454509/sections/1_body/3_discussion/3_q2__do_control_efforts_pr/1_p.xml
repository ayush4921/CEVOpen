<p>The so-called “success” of a weed control program needs to be gauged relative to objectives [
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Perverse outcomes can arise if the sole measure of success is a reduction of the target invasive species without consideration of the potential for re-invasion by that species or other non-native plants (

 <xref rid="pone.0128482.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). However, we found no evidence of a significant level of re-invasion of Bitou Bush treated sites where the spray-fire-spray treatment had been applied for at least three years after the final spray (
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). Our study has continued for seven years but as outlined above and given the potential risks of re-invasion, ongoing surveys of vegetation cover (including those of the prevalence of Bitou Bush) are critical. This will help determine how frequently control efforts need to be employed.
