<p>Fire typically led to an increase in most measures of native plant species richness and/or cover, whereas spraying had the opposite effect. Measures like the number of native plant seedlings and native grasses exhibited a significant positive increase over time, suggesting the negative effects of spraying were relatively short-lived (1â€“2 years). Our results also suggest that the increases in native plant species richness and cover over time occurred whilst there was a concurrent decline in the number of live Bitou Bush plants (

We therefore conclude that the removal of the target invasive plant species is providing opportunities for native vegetation recovery, although some individual species of native plants were significantly negatively affected by spraying or burning (
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Indeed, we found a strong negative response to spraying with the level of change ranging from a 19% to 60% reduction (

 <xref rid="pone.0128482.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]) but appear to be counter to the current perception that ULV glyphosate used in winter for Bitou Bush control has only limited impact on native plant species. Moreover, two spray treatments further reduced the number of native plant species. There is therefore a need for careful application of herbicides coupled with ongoing monitoring to determine native plant recovery trends over time.
