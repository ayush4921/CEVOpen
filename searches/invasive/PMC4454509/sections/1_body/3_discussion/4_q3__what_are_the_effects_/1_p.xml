<p>Our results suggest that Bitou Bush was a driver and not a passenger or transformer of environmental change (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). As a result, when appropriate treatment is employed, this invasive species can be effectively removed, re-invasion is limited, and native plant species can begin to recover. We based this conclusion on strong relationships between spraying and burning treatments and native plant species richness, native plant cover, and individual plant species abundance (
