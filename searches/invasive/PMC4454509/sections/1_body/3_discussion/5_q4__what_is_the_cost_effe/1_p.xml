<p>Few invasive plant control programs attempt to integrate data on the ecological effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness of a weed control program [

 <xref rid="pone.0128482.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] as well as a number of studies of invasive plants in agricultural crops). Yet, integration of costs in management assessment is important because only limited funds are available for weed control. We suggest the point at which cost becomes important is when there is more than one possible control action that meets the management objective (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). This was not the case for Bitou Bush. That is, we could not identify an alternative treatment sequence to spray-fire-spray which had the same controlling effect on Bitou Bush while at the same time minimizing the negative impacts on native vegetation.
