<p>Of the treatment sequences we examined, the current spray-fire-spray protocol had the greatest controlling effect (

 <xref rid="pone.0128482.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Some alternative treatment sequences led to perverse outcomes through increasing Bitou Bush cover and/or abundance (
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). In terms of cost-benefit assessment, these treatments were not cost-effective, and only the full spray-fire-spray sequence yielded cost effectiveness in terms of outcomes. This has important implications, given resourcing issues associated with implementing the full treatment sequence. However, there can sometimes be opportunities to improve cost-effectiveness such as after unplanned fires in areas infested with Bitou Bush to spray the pulse of germinants after fire. This would be particularly cost-effective as fire management is the most expensive component of the treatment sequence protocol. Hence, managers should be alert to the potential ecological and financial benefits that can arise from unplanned events. Application of post-fire spraying would need to be timed appropriately to limit its impacts on native plant species. Moreover, as many weed control programs have sub-components of a full treatment protocol and each step has a monetary cost, there may be opportunities for savings by eliminating unnecessary, non-significant sub-components. As an example from this study, repeated spraying events following wildfire were unnecessary as the number of individual Bitou Bush plants was reduced close to zero after the first round of post-fire spraying (
