<p>Our study suggested that spray-fire-spray was the best treatment sequence for reducing the number and cover of live Bitou Bush plants (Figs

Conversely, evidence suggests that fire without spraying led to an increase in the abundance of Bitou Bush, highlighting the importance of control methods (and the sequence of treatments within the protocol) that are tightly aligned to the ecology of the target plant species. We readily acknowledge that despite the comparative success of the spray-fire-spray as the best treatment sequence, constant monitoring, evaluation and potentially follow-up control will be required, especially as birds and other animals may continue to bring Bitou Bush seeds into the study area.
