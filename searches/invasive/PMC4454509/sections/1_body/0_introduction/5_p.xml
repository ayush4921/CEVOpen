<p>The fundamental objective (i.e. primary, underlying motivation) of Bitou Bush control in BNP is to restore native plant species richness to levels characteristic of uninvaded sites [
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This aim is pursued through attempts to limit the spread of the species and confine it to low levels of abundance within those places where it currently exists. Whether these means objectives (secondary aims that are collectively designed to meet the fundamental objective, i.e. means to an end) are appropriate for achieving the fundamental objective will depend upon whether Bitou Bush is a driver, passenger or transformer of environmental change (
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). If Bitou Bush is a driver of ecological change resulting in native species loss, its control (which may need to be ongoing if Bitou Bush propagules continue to arrive) should lead to ecosystem recovery, assuming minimal off-target impacts of the control method, an absence of tipping points and alternative stable states, a lack of other invasive, driver species, and availability of native seeds and mutualists (
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). If Bitou Bush is a passenger of environmental change, control (ongoing or not) that targets the species will not lead to native species recovery and ecosystems will likely be invaded by other exotic plant species where exotic seed sources are available. This may also occur if the weed is a transformer of the environment such that sites are no longer suitable for the native plant species [
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. If Bitou Bush is a passenger of environmental change, a different means objective will be required to achieve the fundamental objective as Bitou Bush control will not help to restore native plant species richness. To date, it has not been possible to assess whether efforts to control Bitou Bush in BNP are meeting any of the fundamental or means objectives and therefore if program costs are warranted relative to benefits obtained.
