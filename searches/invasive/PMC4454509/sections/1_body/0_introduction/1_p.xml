<p>Biological invasions are considered to be a major threat to biodiversity [
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Consequently, invasive species management is often justified through its contribution to biodiversity conservation goals. However, there are frequently complex issues associated with invasive species control, including potentially deleterious impacts on native species [
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and ecosystems, such as herbicide effects on pollinators [
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Invasive species control also may increase resource availability (e.g. light, water, nutrients) and can make a community more susceptible to re-invasion by the target invader or other invasive species [
