<p>Given that Bitou Bush was extensively planted in parts of BNP, and the reserve supports few other non-native plant species [
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], our first hypothesis was that it was a driver of environmental change, which is consistent with other research (e.g. [

 <xref rid="pone.0128482.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,

 <xref rid="pone.0128482.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). Therefore, if the abundance of Bitou Bush was reduced through management, we postulated that the abundance of native plant species would increase. However, off-target impacts of control or a lack of native seeds and mutualists could mask ecosystem recovery following Bitou Bush removal. Notwithstanding these limitations, testing this hypothesis would allow us to quantify the benefits of Bitou Bush control relative to its costs and also determine whether control efforts were successful in terms of meeting the means objectives and the fundamental management objectives of the control program. To test this hypothesis, we addressed four questions articulated in our general model (
