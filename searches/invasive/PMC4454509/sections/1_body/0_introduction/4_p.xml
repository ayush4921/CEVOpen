<p>We addressed some of these major knowledge gaps using a 7-year experimental case study focused on examining aspects of the effectiveness of the Bitou Bush,

 <italic>rotundata</italic> (DC) T. Norl., control program within Booderee National Park (BNP) in Australia (

 <xref rid="pone.0128482.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], experimental studies of the effectiveness of control efforts have rarely been evaluated in the scientific literature (although see [
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] for several case studies), and particularly the efficacy of different sub-components of the sequence of treatments employed in an attempt to control Bitou Bush (but see [
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]). In addition, the cost-effectiveness of different sub-components of the sequence of treatments has not been determined.
