<p>Under the Driver-Passenger model for invasive species [
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], if the invader is a passenger of environmental change (i.e. native species decline and exotic species invasion both result from environmental change that occurs independently of invasion), removal of the invader will not lead to ecosystem recovery. In such cases, it will likely be more effective to invest in an alternative management approach that addresses the underlying ecological change (e.g. altered disturbance regimes, habitat fragmentation or dispersal limitation of native species) rather than species-specific control of the invader. Conversely, if the invader is a driver of ecosystem change where invasion does not follow, but causes, ecological modification (e.g. suppression of native species whether directly or indirectly), then its removal can lead to ecosystem recovery (e.g. [

 <xref rid="pone.0128482.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In rare cases where species alter environmental conditions in their favour [
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], species can be both drivers and passengers of environmental change: initial invasion leads to environmental change, which facilitates more invasion, establishing a positive feedback between invasion and environmental modification. As a consequence, transformer species, and the ecosystems they invade, are particularly difficult to manage [
