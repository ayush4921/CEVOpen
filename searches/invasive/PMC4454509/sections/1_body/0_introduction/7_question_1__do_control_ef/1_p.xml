<p>The primary treatment for Bitou Bush at BNP comprises a series of sub-treatments including herbicide spraying, burning, and repeat spraying. For logistical and other reasons, not all of these are necessarily completed, nor is the recommended sequence of sub-treatments always conducted. A subsequent question therefore was: 
 <bold>Is there a difference in the response of Bitou Bush when the full sequence of sub-treatments is employed versus when only part of the treatment protocol is applied?</bold>
