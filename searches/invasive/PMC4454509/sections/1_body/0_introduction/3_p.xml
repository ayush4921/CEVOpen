<p>Despite considerable understanding of invasive species ecology, control efforts are rarely evaluated in terms of progress towards key management objectives or relative costs and benefits [

 <xref rid="pone.0128482.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Key inter-related questions often remain unanswered, including: 
 <bold>(1)</bold> whether the target invasive species has been effectively controlled, 
 <bold>(2)</bold> whether a target species is a driver, passenger or transformer of environmental change and hence whether its control is likely to lead to ecosystem recovery, 
 <bold>(3)</bold> whether the methods used to control invasive species have positive or negative impacts on other plants or animals (including other undesirable species), and 
 <bold>(4)</bold> if invasive species management is cost-effective in terms of its benefits relative to levels of expenditure [
