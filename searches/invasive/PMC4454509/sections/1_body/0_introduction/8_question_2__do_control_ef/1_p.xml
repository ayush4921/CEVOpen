<p>Attempts to control invasive plants can increase the susceptibility of an ecosystem to re-invasion by the same or another non-native plant species, termed the “weed-shaped hole effect” [
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We quantified the response of Bitou Bush and other exotic plants to management treatments to determine whether the overall level of invasion (i.e. total abundance of all exotic species) rebounded post-control, which would be evidence of the “weed-shaped hole” effect (
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). As other non-native species are largely absent from those parts of BNP infested by Bitou Bush [
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], we predicted that if a “weed-shaped hole” were created by management, then Bitou Bush would reinvade the managed plots leading to no change in Bitou Bush abundance through time. An alternative possibility was that disturbance by the spray-fire-spray regime may be larger than the individual sub-treatments alone, potentially leading to open niches or lack of competition from native plant species.
