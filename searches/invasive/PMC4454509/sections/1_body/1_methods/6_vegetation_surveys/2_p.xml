<p>We targeted two distinct vegetation types. Major levels of plant species diversity are typically associated with the ground layer in the Swamp Oak woodland and forest ecosystems and this layer was the focus of our experiment. Given this, we elected to pool data from the series of plots at each site to assess the number of individuals of each species. Our aim was 
 <bold>not</bold> to create a comprehensive list of all plant species nor a full documentation of total species richness. Rather, we sampled in a consistent manner across all plots within the 33 sites in our experiment and then compared various measures of plant response through time and between sites subject to different treatment sequences.
