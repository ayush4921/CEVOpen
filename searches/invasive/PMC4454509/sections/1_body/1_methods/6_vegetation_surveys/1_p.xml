<p>We established four 1 m x 1 m permanent survey plots on an 80 m transect on each of our 33 sites. Plots on each transect were set at least 20 m apart. At each plot, we placed a 1m x 1m frame on or over the vegetation. We then completed % cover measurements for live Bitou Bush, dead Bitou Bush, all native vegetation, crown cover (by observation above the plot to an area of approximately 10 m x 10 m). In addition, we completed counts of the number of individual live Bitou Bush plants, dead Bitou Bush plants, other exotic plant species, and native plant species. We derived a list of species in each 1m x 1m survey plot, from which we generated data for the number of exotic and native plant species on the transect. A single observer (CM) completed all vegetation surveys between 2007 and 2014.</p>
