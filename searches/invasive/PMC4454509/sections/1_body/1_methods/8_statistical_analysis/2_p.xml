<p>We fitted Hierarchical Generalized Linear Models (HGLM) [
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] to our data on the number of individual Bitou Bush plants, percentage cover of live and dead Bitou Bush, native plant species richness, percentage cover of native plants, number of individual native plants, percentage crown cover, and the number of individuals of the most abundant species of native plants. For count data, we assumed a quasi-Poisson distribution and a gamma distribution with a log link function for the random component of the model [
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Because observations of cover data appeared to be less variable for sites with very high or low cover, we used a quasi-binomial distribution with a logit link, and a beta distribution with a logit link for the random component (see [
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]). We fitted random effects for both site and survey year to account for between-site differences not related to the treatments. Because many treatments were applied after surveys had commenced, comparison of treatment sequences is possible for individual sites, and estimates of treatment effects are based on the combination of both observed within-site differences and observed between-site differences. Thus, each treatment site acted as its own control given it was surveyed on a repeated basis after different sub-components of the treatment sequence.
