<p>Initially, we ignored the random structure and fitted all possible subsets of these predictors plus the sequence factor defined above. We ranked these models using the Schwarz Information Criterion (BIC) [
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and then fitted the best model for the fixed effects with year and site random effects included in the model. We used Wald tests to identify the terms that still had significant effects, and we dropped terms that were clearly non-significant at this stage. We investigated interactions between the remaining terms.
