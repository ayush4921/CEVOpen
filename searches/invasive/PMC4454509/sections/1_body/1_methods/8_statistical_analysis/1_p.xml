<p>We employed a suite of statistical approaches to determine whether Bitou Bush was a passenger or driver. These methods were used to quantify the effects of the components of the Bitou Bush treatment sequence on various metrics of native vegetation cover as well as their impacts on a suite of individual species of native plants. We also quantified the impacts of the occurrence of Bitou Bush on individual native plant species. In all models reported, we included site as a random term to allow for the likelihood that sites differed in their susceptibility to Bitou Bush infestation, and in the vegetation that would normally be found on those sites.</p>
