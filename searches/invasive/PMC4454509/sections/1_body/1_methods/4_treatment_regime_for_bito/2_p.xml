<p>After the first application of herbicide, dead Bitou Bush plants dry for &gt;1 year before being burned in a prescribed fire. The fire triggers germination of Bitou Bush seed in the soil and a year later, a follow-up spray of ULV glyphosate kills fire-triggered seedlings (
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). Treatment burns are applied to 15â€“85 ha areas of vegetation where Bitou Bush has been sprayed in any given year. These areas are currently not subject to additional prescribed burning programs for fire hazard reduction or the protection of human infrastructure. Unlike many other invasive plant species control programs, there is no replanting or seeding of native plants in BNP as it is assumed that native vegetation will recover by seeds dispersing from untreated to treated areas.
