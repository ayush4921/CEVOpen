<p>We generated cost estimates (in AUD ha
 <sup>-1</sup> in 2012) for the different sub-treatments employed in Bitou Bush control from actual costs of spraying and burning incurred according to budget records of resource managers based in BNP who applied the treatment programs. The cost of aerial spraying was $A145 ha
 <sup>-1</sup>. Fire treatments entailed burning of 15â€“85 ha compartments after herbicide spraying. Fire treatment costs were estimated to be $A1150 ha
 <sup>-1</sup>, based on the number of people and fire control vehicles involved, the size of burned areas, and pre-fire track maintenance to limit the risks of fire escaping the compartment targeted for burning.
