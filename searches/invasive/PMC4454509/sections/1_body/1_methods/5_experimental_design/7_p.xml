<p>Our experiment comprised 33 sites, each with an 80-metre long transect and encompassed three site types: 
 <bold>(1)</bold> Control sites with no Bitou Bush. 
 <bold>(2)</bold> Sites with Bitou Bush where the complete control regime of spray-fire-spray was applied. And, 
 <bold>(3)</bold> Sites with Bitou Bush where only part of the treatment regime was applied. Each site was surveyed on up to 14 occasions, giving 356 site-survey combinations in total (
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Our study focused on documenting the history of treatments at a given site in the preceding four years. Spraying was denoted S, Fire was denoted F. For example, the treatment sequence spray-fire-spray at a site is shown as SFS, and spray-spray-fire is SSF. The absence of a component of the treatment sequence was denoted X; for instance a site subject to spray and a fire was presented as SFX. Sites where there was no fire or spraying were represented as XXX. Control sites without Bitou Bush were denoted XXSc if they had been sprayed and XXXc otherwise (see
