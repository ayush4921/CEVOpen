<p>First, under the management plan for BNP, areas invaded by Bitou Bush 
 <bold>must</bold> be subject to some kind of treatment (even if the recommended protocol cannot be fully implemented; see below). This precluded the establishment of permanent control sites where Bitou Bush occurred but remained untreated. However each site was surveyed on a number of occasions at different stages of the treatment sequence, so comparisons of no treatment, a partial sequence of treatments, and a full sequence can be made from observations at the same site. We also included external control sites where Bitou Bush did not occur. Half of these non-infested sites were sprayed with ULV glyphosate. These sites were used to help assess the effect of the treatments on native vegetation in the absence of Bitou Bush. Importantly, the control sites had a similar past disturbance history (of grazing and clearing) to the treatment sites so they could be appropriately compared. All sites were located in the same broad area (with similar climatic conditions) and in the same two target vegetation types where infestation is a particular problemâ€”Swamp Oak and forest dominated by Bangalay.
