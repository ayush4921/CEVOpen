<p>After Bitou Bush, the next three most prevalent exotic plant species recorded in our surveys were rare. They were Creeping Woodsorrel 
 <italic>Oxalis corniculata</italic> L. (89 individuals recorded across all sites in all years), Fleabane 
 <italic>Conyza bonariensis</italic> (L.) (65 individuals recorded), and Black-berry Nightshade 
 <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic> L. (17 individuals recorded). Bitou Bush removal did not lead to a significant increase in the abundance of these or any other (even rarer) exotic species (data not shown).
