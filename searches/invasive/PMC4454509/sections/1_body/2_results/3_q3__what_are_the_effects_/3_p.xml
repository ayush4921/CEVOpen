<p>Nine of the 19 individual species we examined exhibited a significant (P &lt; 0.05) negative response to spraying with the level of change ranging from 18% to 67% reduction (

 <italic>Glycine tabacina</italic> (Labill.) Benth. and Snake Vine 
 <italic>Stephania japonica</italic> (Thunb.) Miers, exhibited a marked increase following fire. Others (e.g. the grasses 
 <italic>Microlaena stipoides</italic> (Labill.) R.Br. and 
 <italic>Entolasia marginata</italic> (R.Br.) Hughes) declined markedly after fire (
