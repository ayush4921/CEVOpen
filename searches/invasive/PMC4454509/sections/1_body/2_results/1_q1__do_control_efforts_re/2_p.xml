 <xref rid="pone.0128482.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> highlights the composite effects for sites in a given treatment sequence on the abundance of Bitou Bush (i.e. cover and number of plants). We decomposed these effects to examine site-specific responses for eight experimental sites (Figs 
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.g006" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.g007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). This underscored the importance of following fire with a spray treatment to achieve effective control. Our data showed that after spray-fire-spray, Bitou Bush abundance remained at zero or close to it for at least 2â€“3 years (
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). Other treatment sequences such as spraying and fire (without subsequent spraying) led to a significant increase in the abundance of Bitou Bush (
