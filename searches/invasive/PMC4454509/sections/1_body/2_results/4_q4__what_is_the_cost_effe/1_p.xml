<p>We calculated the costs (on a ha
 <sup>-1</sup> basis) of the different treatment sequences and compared them with their effects on the abundance of both Bitou Bush and native plant species. This enabled comparison of relative cost-effectiveness of different sequences of sub-treatments (
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Spray-fire-spray ranked best among treatment sequences in terms of Bitou Bush control, close to the top in terms of native plant species richness and cover, but was relatively expensive compared to some other treatment sequences (
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>). Sequences like fire-fire-spray were more costly than spray-fire-spray (
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) but somewhat less effective in controlling Bitou Bush (
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). Less expensive options such as a single spray event had limited controlling effects on Bitou Bush (
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>), but significant negative effects on native plant species (Tables 
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>). Comparatively costly sequences like two spraying events followed by fire ranked moderately well in terms of Bitou Bush control and best for species richness. Fire without spraying exacerbated the invasive plant species problem by leading to an increase in Bitou Bush abundance and cover (
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). Yet, other treatment sequences such as fire followed by a series of three spraying events resulted in a significant reduction in the number of Bitou Bush plants (
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). However, in this case, there were no significant differences the number of Bitou Bush plants after one spraying event compared with three post-fire spraying events (
 <xref rid="pone.0128482.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>), suggesting no additional benefits were derived from the added costs of extra spraying.
