 <p>We thank the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community for support and the Australian Research Council and National Environmental Research Program for funding. We acknowledge the input of the late John Toth who was very supportive of this project and its attempt to gather empirical evidence on the effectiveness of the Bitou Bush control program in BNP. We also acknowledge the assistance of Charles Krebs and Gene Likens in their field review of the project design and implementation, including the recommendation to apply a spraying program to control sites without Bitou Bush.</p>
