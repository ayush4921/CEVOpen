 <caption> Treatment sequence effects on the number of individual Bitou Bush plants (A) and the amount of Bitou Bush cover (B). S denotes spray and F denotes fire. For example, the sequence spray-fire-spray is denoted SFS. Where there were fewer than three treatments an X denotes the missing event. The numbers above each treatment sequence correspond to the number of surveys completed for that sequence. Each column has an associated 95% confidence interval. A given site is surveyed many times throughout the duration of the study and can appear under different treatment sequences according to the progression of particular treatments over time (see text). </caption>
