  <title>Appropriate management actions following incursion of an invasive species (Bitou Bush) and concurrent loss of native species.</title>
  <p>The decision tree can be applied to any situation where an invasive species is suspected of causing native species loss, but where understanding of the process is limited. Actions are based on post-treatment observations, but can be tailored depending on knowledge of a system (e.g. the sequence of tests for scenarios 3–5 can be altered). The decision tree accounts for the main factors that may limit recovery of native species (changed biotic conditions (competition from invaders, loss of mutualists), propagule availability and environmental suitability) and tests these in a sequence likely to be most cost-effective for native species restoration. Costs include resources and off-target impacts. Where Bitou Bush acts as a driver of ecological change (Scenarios 2–5) and its propagules continue to be dispersed into the area, ongoing control will be required. Scenarios 3–5 may be the result of prolonged Bitou Bush invasion (Bitou Bush as a driver, albeit not immediately detectable), off-target impacts of the control method or they may be independent of Bitou Bush invasion (although evidence indicates that this is unlikely); additional means objectives (see text) will be required to enable native species restoration. In Scenario 6, means objectives will need to be changed from control of the invader to management of the environment to meet the fundamental objective of management. Because inferences are based solely on post-treatment observations, it is not possible to distinguish between an invader that is a passenger or transformer with this decision tree (environmental change may be dependent or independent of invasion). However, this lack of certainty does not affect the recommended application and sequence of management actions when this framework is first applied to a case study, though it will affect future recommendations for that case study (i.e. if invaders are passengers, not transformers, only the environment need to be managed).</p>
