Researchers interested in obtaining the data need only register with the LTERN Data Portal and make a request. This approach to data publication allows the authors to monitor and report on who is wishing to use their data and why. This information is shared with the Wreck Bay Indigenous Community, on whose land the study was conducted. The Community is an Associated Party of the data and the authors report to its Board.
