 <caption> Chi-square test for the stable population structure. The test shows the difference between the observed population vector and the predicted stable population vector (i.e., the right eigenvector of the transition matrix). These vectors give the relative proportion of individuals at the different life-stages (SB, Juv, Ad 1.5 , Ad 5 , â€¦, A d 300 ). Because the fraction of seeds in the seed bank (SB) was much higher than the fraction of individuals at all other life-stages combined (more than 0.95), we tested the difference with and without the seed bank.
