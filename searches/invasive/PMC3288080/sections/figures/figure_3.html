 <caption> Life-cycle and life-stages of Parkinsonia aculeata. Nodes represent the three main demographic stages: seed bank ( SB), juvenile ( Juv: non-reproductive) and adult ( Ad). Nodes (continuous lines) represent stages that can be stratified at an annual time step. The adult stage (dashed line) was stratified into 7 sub-stages according to canopy volume: Ad 1.5 , Ad 5 , Ad 20 , Ad 50 , Ad 100 , Ad 200 , Ad 300 m 3: for instance in the volume class A 1.5 , trees have a volume between ]1.5 m 3â€“5 m 3], and Ad 300 have volume larger than 300 m 2. Arcs that link nodes represent the flow of individuals that transit from one stage to another. Self-loops represent the capacity for individuals to delay the transition to the next stage. </caption>
