 <caption> Spatial distribution of P. aculeata and survey design according to climate and habitat. A) Current distribution of P. aculeata across Australia (&gt;800,000 km 2) and the survey design across a 1,000 km rainfall gradient. B) Australian locations climatically similar to surveyed sites, as determined using climate-matching function in CLIMEXâ„¢ [70]. Within each climate region, populations were surveyed where possible between 2001 and 2007 in three habitat types (defined according to inundation patterns), for a total of 23 populations and more than 3,000 individuals at different life-stages. </caption>
