   <bold>A</bold>) Current distribution of 
   <italic>P. aculeata</italic> across Australia (&gt;800,000 km
   <sup>2</sup>) and the survey design across a 1,000 km rainfall gradient. 
   <bold>B</bold>) Australian locations climatically similar to surveyed sites, as determined using climate-matching function in CLIMEXâ„¢ 
   <xref rid="pone.0032323-Sutherst1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. Within each climate region, populations were surveyed where possible between 2001 and 2007 in three habitat types (defined according to inundation patterns), for a total of 23 populations and more than 3,000 individuals at different life-stages.
