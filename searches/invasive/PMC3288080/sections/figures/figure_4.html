 <caption> Tree-level plastic response between the mass of individual seeds and the number of seeds produced across the rainfall gradient. A) Reversible plastic tree-level response of the seed mass-seed number trade-off to rainfall. B) Reconstruction of seed mass distribution across the rainfall gradient from 1930 to 2007, using the observed plastic response. C) The most parsimonious tree-level trade-off between seed production and seed mass across the rainfall gradient. Nomenclature - colours correspond to climate regions, as in Figure 1A. Error bars represent s.e. </caption>
