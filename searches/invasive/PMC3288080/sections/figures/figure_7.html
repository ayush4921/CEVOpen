 <caption> Selection pressure on the plastic trade-off across the annual rainfall gradient, calculated as the sensitivity of average fitness to potential change in the slope ( α) and intercept ( β) of the trade-off between seed mass and seed number. Error bars represent s.d. For the riparian habitat in the semi-arid hot and semi-wet tropical region, sensitivities are not stochastic and s.d. represents the variation between years at those sites. </caption>
