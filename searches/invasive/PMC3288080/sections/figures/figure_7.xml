 <caption>
  <title>Selection pressure on the plastic trade-off across the annual rainfall gradient, calculated as the sensitivity of 
   <italic>average fitness</italic> to potential change in the slope (
   <italic>α</italic>) and intercept (
   <italic>β</italic>) of the trade-off between seed mass and seed number.
  </title>
  <p>Error bars represent s.d. For the riparian habitat in the semi-arid hot and semi-wet tropical region, sensitivities are not stochastic and s.d. represents the variation between years at those sites.</p>
