<p>Three spatial strategies have been proposed by which phenotypic plasticity can benefit components of fitness (the vital rates) for some life-stages 
 <xref rid="pone.0032323-Richards1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and in some cases ultimately increase average fitness across the life-cycle 
 <xref rid="pone.0032323-Hulme1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0032323-Davidson1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>: the “
 <italic>Master-of-Some</italic>” (
 <italic>MS</italic>) strategy, where plasticity results in an increase in average fitness in a limited number of habitats or climatic conditions (fitness maximization), possibly allowing for higher population densities under favourable conditions; the “
 <italic>Jack-of-all-Trades</italic>” (
 <italic>JT</italic>) strategy, where plasticity maintains average fitness in the face of stressful environmental conditions, possibly conferring greater ecological breadth across their distribution (fitness homeostasis); and the hybrid “
 <italic>Jack-and-Master</italic>” (
 <italic>JM</italic>) strategy, where organisms are able to maintain average fitness in sub-optimal conditions and to opportunistically increase average fitness in optimal environments. 
 <italic>JM</italic> species represent the “ideal” organisms 
 <xref rid="pone.0032323-Baker1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, as they are considered more likely to have geographic ranges that can span diverse environments, are better able to respond to rapid environmental change, and are more likely to be highly invasive 
 <xref rid="pone.0032323-Richards1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0032323-Davidson1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Theory suggests that these plastic strategies can be expected to influence the shape, size and dynamics of species distribution 
 <xref rid="pone.0032323-Sultan1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0032323-Muth1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0032323-Pohlman1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0032323-Santamaria1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. For example, a 
 <italic>JT</italic> strategy occurring at range margins may be expected to sustain the size and the expansion of the species geographic range, whereas a 
 <italic>MS</italic> strategy occurring at the range centre may help amplify the difference in population abundance between the centre and the margin of the range 
 <xref rid="pone.0032323-Sagarin1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0032323-Sagarin2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. The challenge is to determine whether this actually happens in the field.
