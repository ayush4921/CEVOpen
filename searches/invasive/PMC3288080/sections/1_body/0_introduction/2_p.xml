<p>Organisms' morphology can plastically respond to changes in environmental conditions, such as through independent plastic traits (such as changing plant size) or through reallocations between pairs of traits (such as between seed mass and seed number)

 <xref rid="pone.0032323-PaulVictor1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. These plastic responses can enhance physiological (e.g., growth, germination) and demographic (e.g., survival, fecundity) components of fitness

 <xref rid="pone.0032323-Funk1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. However, these benefits do not necessarily translate into a higher intrinsic rate of natural increase or “average fitness”

 <italic>Average fitness</italic> is a single life-cycle measure that synthesizes the fitness benefits of all the vital components of fitness (survival, growth and fecundity) for each life-stage

 <xref rid="pone.0032323-Caswell2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. There are a few examples where plastic responses have been demonstrated to increase average fitness at a local scale

 <xref rid="pone.0032323-Jongejans1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Also, some studies have described plastic responses across species geographic ranges
