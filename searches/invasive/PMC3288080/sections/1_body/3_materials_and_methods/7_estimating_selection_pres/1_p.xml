<p>Multivariate linear regression analysis can be used to estimate the selection pressure on plastic morphological traits when few fitness components are measured

 <italic>α</italic> and intercept 
 <italic>β</italic> of the trade-off) is under selection pressure at an individual tree level, with regard to the

 <xref rid="pone.0032323-Caswell2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>). As we used the average estimate of the trade-off between seed mass and number, we approximated the sensitivity of the

 <italic>λ
  <sub>s</sub>
 </italic>) to changes in the slope 
 <italic>α</italic> and intercept
