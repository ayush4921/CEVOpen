<p>Juvenile and adult growth and survival rates, and seedling survival rates, were estimated for a maximum of six years between 2001 and 2007. Where possible, juvenile and adult growth and survival rates were estimated per site and year. Seed survival rate, germination rate, seed mass and seed number (i.e. fertility) were only estimated from 2001 to 2003. These values were therefore extrapolated through to 2007 using empirical relationships between seed mass and annual rainfall, seed mass and seed survival, germination and rainfall, and seed mass and seed number (see results).</p>
