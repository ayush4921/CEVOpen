<p>Juvenile and adult growth and survival rates at each site were calculated empirically from annual census data from individually tagged trees (large juveniles &gt;1 m tall) and un-tagged small juveniles (&lt;1 m). Only healthy plants were used to estimate growth rates in order to determine the undisturbed plastic response of trees
