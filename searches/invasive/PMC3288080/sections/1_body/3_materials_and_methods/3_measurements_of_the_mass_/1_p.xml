<p>The number of seeds and the average seed mass per tree (calculated from 100 randomly selected seeds) were measured annually between 2001 to 2003, by placing litter traps under the canopy of ten randomly selected large adult trees (≥100 m
 <sup>3</sup> in canopy) within each of the 22 sites. Annual number of seeds produced per tree (fertility rate

 <sup>3</sup>[, [5–20 m
 <sup>3</sup>[and [20–50 m
 <sup>3</sup>[), using exponential regression of fecundity against tree volume for every site and year. Seed production at some sites was greatly reduced in trees that severely affected by a soil-borne pathogen

 <xref rid="pone.0032323-DeWitt1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. We used tree-level estimates of seed mass and seed number (seeds per canopy area) to model the average trade-off between seed mass and number across the species distribution. We then modelled its relation with rainfall in the year preceding seed production.
