<p>No specific permits were required for the described field experiments. We selected 23 sites in Australia's Northern Territory along a 1000 km climatic gradient spanning four climate regions (arid, semi-arid, semi-wet/dry tropics, wet/dry tropics). Sites were chosen to best represent the range of habitat types within each climate zone (upland, wetland and riparian) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032323-g001">Fig. 1A, 1B</xref>), and that could be accessed year-round. The surveyed populations had few or no other competing plant species, and had sufficient canopy openings for continued invasion and to minimize density-dependent effects. We selected sites to include at least 10 healthy large adults (&gt;200 m
 <sup>3</sup>). Where there was a discrete population, the entire population was included within the site. Surveys at all life-stages were conducted from 2001 to 2007 annually during winter (June-Sept) when conditions were cool and dry and populations were relatively static. Some sites were terminated prematurely (and in some cases replaced with new sites) following major disturbance events. The site characteristics can be found in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0032323.s001">Table S1</xref>. All seedlings (&lt;20 cm) and small juveniles (20–100 cm) were systematically censused from 2001 to 2007. All trees above 1 m in height were individually tagged during the first census, or as they reached that size in subsequent censuses. For each tagged plant we recorded its fate (alive or dead), height, and canopy width (along both axes). Canopy volume was used to track growth by assuming canopy volume as a spheroid. Seed bank density (

 <sup>2</sup>, 5 cm deep) placed under each of five randomly selected large adult trees.
