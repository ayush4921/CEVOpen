<p>The effect of the observed level of phenotypic plasticity on average fitness across the rainfall gradient was tested. We first calculated average fitness (
 <italic>rs-value</italic>) for each site using the observed trade-off between seed mass and seed number for that site. We then compared this result with average fitness assuming that there was no reallocation between seed mass and seed number across the moisture gradient (i.e., no plastic reallocation). This was done using the lowest average seed mass (i.e., 48.7 mg), or lowest fertility from where seeds were biggest (in the wet-dry tropics). We compared the 
 <italic>r
  <sub>s</sub>-values
 </italic> across the rainfall gradient (with or without plasticity) to assess whether plasticity allowed some populations to maintain positive 
 <italic>r
  <sub>s</sub>-values
 </italic> (JT), to increase already positive 
 <italic>r
  <sub>s</sub>-values
 </italic> (MS), or both (JM). We then tested whether the geographic pattern of JT,MS or JM strategies (i.e. the gain in 
 <italic>r
  <sub>s</sub>-values
 </italic> provided by plasticity) could be predicted by the rainfall gradient. For this analysis, we fitted a non-linear model of distribution using the software SciDavis and the Scaled Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with a tolerance 10
