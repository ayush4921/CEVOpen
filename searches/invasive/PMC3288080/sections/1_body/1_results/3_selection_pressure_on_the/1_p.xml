<p>Prospective sensitivity analysis suggests that plasticity itself is not fixed on an evolutionary time scale. This analysis suggests that both the slope 
 <italic>α</italic> and intercept 
 <italic>β</italic> of the trade-off between seed mass and number are under natural selection pressure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032323-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). Selection pressure on the slope was linearly correlated with the selection pressure on the intercept (Selection[α] = −59.9(±3.7)×Selection[β], R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.98, p&lt;10
 <sup>−6</sup>), and both followed a lognormal distribution along the rainfall gradient (for selection on 
 <italic>α</italic>: 
 <italic>R
  <sup>2</sup>
 </italic> = 0.71, 
 <italic>χ
  <sup>2</sup>

 <italic>df</italic> = 5.10
 <sup>−4</sup>, with y
 <sub>0</sub> = 120.7±2.08, θ = 244.8±3.9. ζ = 6.63±0.01, σ = −0.93±0.02; and for selection on 
 <italic>β</italic>:

 <italic>df</italic> = 10

 <sup>−4</sup>, θ = 190.4±0.08. ζ = 6.54±5.97, σ = 0.73±2.10
 <sup>−4</sup>). Selection pressure is greatest at the range centre (for rainfall≈500–1100 mm), such that trees are expected to produce more seeds under ideal conditions while maintaining the same seed mass. This would result in a more pronounced MS at the range centre and maintenance of the 
 <italic>JT</italic> strategy at range margins.
