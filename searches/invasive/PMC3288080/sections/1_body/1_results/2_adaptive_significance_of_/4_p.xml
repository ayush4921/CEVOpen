<p>Both 
 <italic>JT</italic> and 
 <italic>MS</italic> strategies can co-occur across the species distribution, as predicted from the correlation between the reduction of extinction probability and the average fitness gain provided by plasticity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032323-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>). Trees tend to be more 
 <italic>MS</italic> where the average fitness gain is high compared to the extinction probability gain (i.e., at the range centre), while trees will be more 
 <italic>JT</italic> where the extinction probability gain is high compared to the average fitness gains (i.e., at the range margins). The semi-wet/dry tropic (SWT
 <sub>2</sub>) was an exception. Extinction risk was relatively high at that site despite it being in the range centre, and the 
 <italic>JT</italic> strategy was therefore most pronounced. Altogether, the plastic reallocation between seed mass and seed number is a combination of 
 <italic>JT</italic> and 
 <italic>MS</italic> strategies across the species distribution, that is, a 
 <italic>JM</italic> strategy.
