<p>Seed mass at the individual tree level varied through space and time, and this was best explained as a plastic, reversible tree-level response of seed mass to rainfall. A hierarchical linear mixed-effect analysis which included trees and sites as random grouping factors (years 
 <italic>nested within</italic> trees 
 <italic>nested within</italic> sites) showed that variability in seed mass at the individual tree-level was greater between years at a site (s.d. = 7.8 mg) than between trees within a site (s.d. = 2.6E
 <sup>−04</sup> mg), and was similar to variability between sites (s.d. = 6.4 mg). This random model was then compared with other models that incorporated combinations of climate, habitat, annual rainfall and time as fixed explanatory variables. The most parsimonious model showed that the variation in seed mass produced by each tree between years and between sites was best explained by changes in climate region, years and rainfalls (AIC = 1316, 
 <italic>wAIC</italic> = 1). Habitat was the least significant factor (AIC = 1469, 
 <italic>wAIC</italic> = 0). The average seed mass produced by each tree (
 <italic>m
  <sub>seed</sub>
 </italic>) responded linearly to rainfall (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032323-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>) being smaller than those produced in wetter years (2001, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032323-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>) in the semi-arid areas (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032323-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Similarly, seeds produced in the driest years in the semi-arid region (2002, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032323-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>) were smaller than those produced in the wettest year (2001, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032323-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) in the arid region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032323-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). A reconstruction of historical fluctuations in seed mass, based on local rainfall data since invasion commenced 
 <italic>ca</italic> 1930 (using the relation between seed mass and annual rainfall), showed that the amplitude of the plastic response within the different climate regions may have been higher than observed from three years of observations, with individuals in the wet-dry tropics and arid regions frequently producing seeds with overlapping mass within their life time (c. 30 years) (
