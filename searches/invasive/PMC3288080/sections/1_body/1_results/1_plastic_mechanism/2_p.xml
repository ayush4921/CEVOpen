<p>The average seed mass produced by each tree (
 <italic>m
  <sub>seed</sub>
 </italic>) was found to be linearly negatively correlated with the density of seeds produced (
 <italic>ϕ</italic>) by these same trees across the species distribution (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032323-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>), such that

 </italic>+
 <italic>β</italic> (where the fecundity rate 
 <italic>f</italic> = 
 <italic>ϕ</italic> ×υ, and where υ is the tree canopy volume). The strength of the trade-off depended on habitat type and geographic location, with both the slope and intercept being higher in riparian (R) semi-wet tropics (SWT) (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.44, n = 36, p&lt;0.01, 
 <italic>α</italic> = −4.17±1.28 and 
 <italic>β</italic> = 404±82) than at other locations (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.28, n = 196, p&lt;0.001; 
 <italic>α</italic> = −2.7±0.32 and 
 <italic>β</italic> = 257±23). Riparian trees in the range centre (SWT) produced more seeds than expected given the rainfall in 2002, but seed mass was as predicted (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032323-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Furthermore, the amplitude of seed mass/number plasticity in response to inter-annual change in rainfall was similar across climate regions, except in the arid margin where it was smaller (
