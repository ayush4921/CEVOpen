<p>Plant invasions represent a special case of geographic range expansion, as it occurs in a new environment and is frequently a rapid process 
 <xref rid="pone.0032323-Gaston1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Phenotypic plasticity is expected to accelerate invasions at a large scale through different types of spatial strategies (
 <italic>JT</italic>, 
 <italic>MS</italic> and 
 <italic>JM</italic>: 
 <xref rid="pone.0032323-Richards1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>). This is supported by experimental observations that introduced species show more plasticity than native species when individuals encounter new and more diverse conditions 
 <xref rid="pone.0032323-Davidson1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0032323-Funk1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, and by different spatial patterns of invasion according to the type of plastic strategy involved 
 <xref rid="pone.0032323-Richards1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. However, despite strong theoretical support, the role of plasticity on invasiveness in general

 <xref rid="pone.0032323-NilssonEhle1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and the different invasive strategies in particular 
 <xref rid="pone.0032323-Richards1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, had not yet been demonstrated through overall population dynamics 
 <xref rid="pone.0032323-Hulme1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Here we mechanistically confirm at a large scale the critical role that temporal plasticity plays in quickly maintaining (through the 
 <italic>JT</italic> strategy) or maximizing (through the 
 <italic>MS</italic> strategy) the average fitness, respectively in optimal and sub-optimal conditions. Without the reversible plastic reallocation, the rate of invasion of 
 <italic>P. aculeata</italic> would not have been as high in its range centre (
 <italic>r
  <sub>s</sub>-values
 </italic> maximized), and the current wet and dry range margins may have never been invaded (
 <italic>r
  <sub>s</sub>-values
 </italic>&lt;0: 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032323-g006">Fig. 6A, 6B</xref>). Our results also confirm that large-scale invasions can occur across continental-scale environmental gradients without the need for genetic differentiation, and therefore without the lag-phases typically associated with even rapid genetic adaptations (Xu et al. 2010).
