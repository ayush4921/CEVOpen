 <italic>P. aculeata</italic> trees produce few-big-seeds that will germinate quickly and have higher survival rates though to the adult stage, but will delay seed production; while in very arid conditions (∼200–300 mm) trees produce many-small-seeds that will delay germination, and seed production will commence when plants are smaller. Under moderately wet conditions, an intermediate response can be observed, such that trees in riparian habitat within SWT produced many big seeds (
