<p>In this study the integration of coordinated plastic responses across the life-cycle has provided important insights into the way organisms can adapt to new and changing environments. To extend our results, we propose that future studies should aim to capture the entire plastic syndrome of an organism across its life-cycle, synthesize it in a single integrated measure of plasticity (e.g. using measures already developed
