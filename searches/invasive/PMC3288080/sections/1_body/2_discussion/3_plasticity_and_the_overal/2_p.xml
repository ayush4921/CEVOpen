<p>In our study, we show that 
 <italic>P. aculeata</italic> uses two coordinated reversible plastic responses (i.e., the seed mass/number trade-off 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032323-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>) in order to adaptively respond to changes in rainfall, irrespective of whether rainfall varied through time at a site, or between sites across a 1000 km climatic gradient. A plastic response in the number of seeds produced (fertility rate) directly affects average fitness whereas plasticity in seed mass only affects average fitness through a positive relationship with seed and seedling survival rates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032323-g005">Fig. 5</xref>) (Caswell, 2001). Other less direct plastic relationships may play an adaptive role, although their contribution was not tested in this study. For instance, seed mass was positively correlated with germination rate 
 <italic>Germ</italic> (i.e., the rate of dormancy release), the later also being passively induced by rainfall and heat (

 <xref rid="pone.0032323-vanKlinken1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> for heat). Furthermore, seed production is delayed to larger tree sizes in the wet-dry tropics when compared to the arid region (estimated by multiplying seed production density [m
