<p>Current explanations and predictions of species invasiveness and geographic distributions rely largely on species distribution models (SDMs:

 <italic>JM</italic>). Our results suggest that SDMs that explicitly consider reversible plastic responses may predict very different species range dynamics compared to models that only consider genetic differentiation. For example spread or shift rates will be faster than observed through genetic differentiation, and will be less sensitive to environmental perturbations at different scales. General rules on the role of plasticity in explaining the underlying process of invasion and species range dynamics may emerge by replicating this type of study on other species, other types of plastic traits and at different temporal and spatial scales.
