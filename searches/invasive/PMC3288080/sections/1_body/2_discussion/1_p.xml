<p>In this study we used a long-term, continental-scale field study of a highly invasive plant to provide the first empirical evidence for the adaptive significance of phenotypic plasticity across a species geographic distribution, and to provide insights into the plastic mechanisms underlying the “

 <xref rid="pone.0032323-Davidson1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Specifically, individual trees used a linear plastic trade-off between seed mass and seed number to maintain fitness across an environmental gradient (through a JT strategy) and maximize it where conditions were ideal (a 
 <italic>MS</italic> strategy). A trade off between seed mass and seed number is a fundamental feature of plants which allows them to adaptively adjust the phenotype of their offspring in response to various environment characteristics

 <xref rid="pone.0032323-Moles1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Here we extend those findings to show that the “
 <italic>Jack-and-Master</italic>” strategy contributes to determining the limits, the shape and the dynamic of a species distribution. Furthermore, we show that the trade-off itself is under natural selection, which is expected to result in an even more pronounced “
 <italic>Jack-and-Master</italic>” strategy.
