<p>Reversible phenotypic plasticity, as a trait, can potentially evolve directly or indirectly in response to selection pressure

 <xref rid="pone.0032323-Sultan2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, the resulting spatial heterogeneity in average fitness benefits are expected to impact the shape of the geographic distribution 
 <xref rid="pone.0032323-Sagarin2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. However, no study provides mechanistic predictions for this phenomenon. Here we show that the selection pressure on the parameters describing the trade-off between seed mass and number (slope and intercept) is expected to increase 
 <italic>average fitness</italic> more at the range centre than at range margins. Therefore, selection on plasticity itself may result in a stronger 
 <italic>MS</italic> strategy at the range centre, whereas the 
 <italic>JT</italic> strategy may already be near its evolutionary limit at the margins. Evolution of the 
 <italic>JM</italic> strategy may therefore contribute more in reinforcing the invasion process within the current climate envelope by amplifying the abundant centre shape of distribution, rather than expanding its existing range limits. This is not to say, however, that further range expansions are not possible as the result of selection on other fitness components.
