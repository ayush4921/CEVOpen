<p>Demonstrating a phenotypic plastic response across an environmental gradient is contingent on excluding the possibility of local genetic adaptation

However, they are generally impractical when looking at seed production of long-lived trees as it can take several years for reproduction to commence. We therefore used an alternative method that relies on tracking through time individual plants located across a spatially and temporally varying environment to test whether variability in seed mass was a reversible plastic response. This approach has previously been used to demonstrate reversible plastic responses in phenological development in response to climate variations or species interactions

 <xref rid="pone.0032323-Brzek1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Our analysis showed that tree-level seed mass responded linearly to rainfall, irrespective of whether rainfall varied through time at a site, or between sites across an environmental gradient. We can therefore conclude that the observed seed mass response to rainfall is the result of the same reversible phenotypic plastic response across the species distribution, and not local adaptation.
