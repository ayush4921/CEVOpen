<p>Living organisms adapt to the environmental stress conditions by undergoing several phenotypic, physiologic and molecular changes, which requires precise regulation at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and translational levels. These changes include but are not limited to activation and repression of several genes [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], changes in molecular chaperones [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], activation of transposable elements [
