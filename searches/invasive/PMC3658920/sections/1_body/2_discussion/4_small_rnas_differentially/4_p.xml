<p>Interestingly, we noted an abundance of sRNAs on the antisense strands of LTR/Gypsy elements, while there was a roughly equal distribution of them on either strand of the LINE/Tad1 elements. This was different from the recent study by Nunes et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] on sRNA species in 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, which showed a more equal distribution of siRNAs on both LTR-associated strands, and may be attributable to the differing conditions used in each study and differing sequencing depth. Association of small RNAs with one strand or the other has been well-studied in Drosophila, for example, antisense siRNAs are abundant for repeat regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In general, transcription of transposons is activated by stress conditions; for example, carbon or nitrogen stresses activate the transcription of Drifter, a novel low copy transposon in 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>. Some of the transposons are transcribed in both directions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>] and environmental stress-regulated antisense transcription of Ty1 LTR-retrotransposons is observed in 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>[
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>].
