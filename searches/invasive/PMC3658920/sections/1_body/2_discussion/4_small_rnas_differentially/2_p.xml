<p>In pathogenic fungal species, efficient pathogen nutrition is essential for successful colonization and fungal fitness [

 <italic>M. oryzae</italic> and many other fungi have demonstrated that nutrient acquisition is a tightly regulated process, involving genes that function in amino acid metabolism and uptake, global nitrogen regulation and pathogenicity [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. In the present study, we found that repeat-associated sRNAs generally and LTR-retrotransposons specifically were induced by oxidative stress and nitrogen starvation, respectively (Additional file 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>: Figure S5). This observation may be similar to Arabidopsis roots undergoing phosphate starvation, which induces a high level of DICER-LIKE1-dependent sRNAs derived from the long terminal repeat of a retrotransposon and a group of 19 nt sRNAs that correspond to the 5’ end of tRNA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. In rice, some repeat-derived sRNAs are down-regulated by abscisic acid and abiotic stresses accompanied by an increased accumulation of their precursors [
