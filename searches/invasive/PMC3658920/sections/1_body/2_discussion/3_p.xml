<p>After spore germination and appressorium formation, 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic> generates a penetration peg that enters into the plant’s epidermal cell. Primary infection hyphae colonize this cell followed by formation of bulbous secondary hyphae and spreading to adjacent epidermal cells (the biotrophic phase; [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]). At about 72 hpi, secondary hyphae spread into mesophyll cells and at this time approximately 10% of total biomass is fungal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], which could account for the reduced amount of total and distinct genome matched reads in 
 <italic>in planta</italic> libraries, compared to the mycelial libraries. Under favorable disease conditions, visible lesions are formed by 96 hpi [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The drastic changes undergone by the pathogen during invasive, later stage growth are reflected in the increased number of genes showing differential abundance for sRNAs during 72 and 96 hpi, as determined by the cluster analysis (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). During these later invasive stages, the fungus is believed to be coping with nutrient-limited environments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In the 
 <italic>in planta</italic> libraries, we observed 562 distinct reads associated with LMg72 compared to LMg96 after the removal of LMg0, which represent rice-only reads (Additional file 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>: Figure S7). Furthermore, out of the ~8000-9000 sRNA reads found in both the LMg72 and LMg96 libraries, only 2132 overlapped, indicating that many unique small RNAs are generated during these invasive, later growth stages. We took advantage of previous transcriptional data generated from our lab in 2011 to determine whether clusters with sRNAs have a negative correlation with significantly differentially expressed genes in the microarray study. Ninety-eight such genes from the microarray study associated with sRNAs and 37.7% of these showed a negative correlation indicating that these particular genes may be regulated epigenetically. The remaining ~60% of the microarray genes showed a positive correlation with the sRNA data. While these are relatively low numbers from a genome-wide perspective, the microarray data was generated from a very early version of the 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic> genome annotation, which has changed considerably in the last four years; furthermore, the 98 genes from the microarray study were based upon highly stringent criteria used both in this study, as well as the study from 2011, limiting the number of such genes we can identify.
