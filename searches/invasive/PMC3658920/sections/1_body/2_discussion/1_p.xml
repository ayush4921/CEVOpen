<p>Only a small fraction of RNA species (2-3%) are translated into proteins in higher organisms, while the remainder includes non-coding yet functional species such as small RNAs [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Small RNAs in eukaryotes have some well-established roles in modulating gene expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, as well as in shaping the organization and modification of chromatin [

 <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>, and in the budding yeast ([

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]). Recently, several detailed studies on sRNAs have emerged in fungal pathogens, including 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic> amongst others [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The current study presented here, adds to this growing information by analyzing sRNAs under various physiological stress conditions and during plant infection. Understanding the epigenetic response of plant pathogens to different environmental conditions may elucidate how these pathogens so successfully adapt to new climates and/or new hosts.
