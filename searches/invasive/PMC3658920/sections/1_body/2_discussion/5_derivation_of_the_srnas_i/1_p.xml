<p>Around 25% of the tags that matched to genes are in antisense orientation (TableÂ 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Interestingly, one-fifth of the annotated genes of this fungus encode both sense and antisense transcripts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. The sources of the dsRNAs for Dicer processing include inverted repeats, bidirectional transcription and antisense transcripts from various loci [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. There is a possibility that overlapping transcripts in an antisense orientation produced from a pair of neighboring genes on opposite DNA strands (convergent overlapping gene pairs or natural cis-antisense gene pairs) form dsRNAs, which may be further processed into sRNAs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Recently, antisense transcripts were also found in other fungal species like the ectomycorrizal ascomycete 
 <italic>Tuber melanosporum</italic>[
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>] and basidiomycete mushroom 
 <italic>Schizophyllus commune</italic>[
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. It is also proven that siRNAs matching to mRNAs in 
 <italic>S. castellii</italic> and in the RNAi reconstituted strain of 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> were indeed produced from dsRNA formed by antisense and overlapping transcription [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. Even in 
 <italic>M. circinelloides</italic>, the majority of the exonic-siRNAS (ex-siRNAs) are antisense to mRNA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Together, these results suggest that at least part of the siRNAs that matched to genes are produced from dsRNA formed by overlapping sense and antisense transcripts in 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic>. We observed that both 5S rRNA and tRNA loci were producing more of sense strand specific sRNAs whereas pseudo-tRNA loci have both sense and antisense sRNAs (data not shown). It has been shown that pseudo-tRNA of 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> is detected to have a function outside protein synthesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>]. Moreover, a subset of pseudogenes generates endo-siRNAs from double-stranded RNAs or directly in mouse oocytes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. The same scenario may exist in 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, because around 40% of pseudo-tRNAs are present either within a gene or opposite strand to it.
