<p>In the RNAi pathway, the Dicer-cleaved sRNAs are bound by Argonautes, and based on their 3’ complementarity Argonautes exert homology dependent transcriptional cleavage or post-transcriptional silencing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>]. The binding of sRNAs to AGO is mainly dependent on structural features of precursor duplexes in animals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>] whereas in plants, it is determined by the 5’ nt of the sRNA. In 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> AGO2 and AGO4 preferentially recruit sRNAs with 5’ A, likewise AGO1 with U and AGO5 with C [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Abundant U at the 5’ end observed in all the mycelial libraries in our study may be biologically significant (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), since this kind of preference was observed in other organisms including the single cell green alga 
 <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>[
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>]. Importantly, a preference for U (T) and suppression of C was observed in 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic> in a recent study, which our data supports [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In the fungal kingdom, 5’ preference for U is observed in qde-2 (Argonaute) associated sRNAs and milRNAs, and disiRNAs of 
 <italic>N. crassa</italic>[
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]; ago-1 associated sRNAs of 
 <italic>S. pombe</italic>[
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]; sRNAs of 
 <italic>S. castelleii</italic> and 
 <italic>K. polysporus</italic>[
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]; and Ex-siRNAs of 
 <italic>Mucor circinelloides</italic>[
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].
