<p>Our results demonstrate that the majority of the sRNAs originate from intergenic regions followed by repeats, protein coding regions and mitochondrial regions, when sRNAs from all libraries were taken together. Our results are supported by those of Nunes et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], who reported abundant sRNAs matching to intergenic regions, transposable elements, rRNA, tRNA, and protein-coding genes, from mycelial and appressorial libraries. Transposons account for about 7% of the 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic> genome (including 5.4% contribution by retrotransposon; [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]); our data suggests that only 4.5% of the total sRNA population matches to transposons (11% of the repeats population), which indicates RNAi may not act as the only mechanism to suppress transposons in 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic>. This observation is further supported by the hypothesis of Murata et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], which supports the operation of a transposon- or repeat-silencing mechanism distinct from both transcriptional gene silencing and siRNA-mediated gene silencing.
