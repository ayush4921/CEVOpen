<p>Though Dicer-like (DCL) proteins are evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotes, their numbers vary among organisms. In the multiple DCL protein-containing organisms such as Drosophila and 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, they function in distinct RNA silencing pathways with overlapping specificity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>]. Both 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic> and its close relative 
 <italic>N. crassa</italic> encode two Dicers. However, MoDcl2 in 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic> functions in siRNA production under normal conditions, whereas 
 <italic>N. crassa</italic> Dicers, orthologs of the 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic> Dicers, act redundantly. While it is likely that MoDcl1 does not have the ability to render or exert a silencing role under normal conditions either triggered by hairpin RNA-expressing transgenes or endogenous repetitive sequences, it is capable of producing siRNAs when overexpressed in an 
 <italic>MoDcl2</italic> deletion background. Moreover, its mRNA levels were up-regulated by 10- to 15- fold during the sexual stage. It has been proven that both 
 <italic>MoDcl1</italic> and 
 <italic>MoDcl2</italic> define functionally diversified RNAi pathways which may have arisen from transcriptional control and protein specialization [
