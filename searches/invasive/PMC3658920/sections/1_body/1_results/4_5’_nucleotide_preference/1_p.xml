<p>Nucleotide preference in the 5’ position is the determining factor in plants for binding of sRNAs to specific AGO proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. While fungi do not appear to share this exact characteristic, preference for particular 5’ nucleotides have been observed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, analysis of different libraries for their 5’ nt preference revealed that sRNAs starting with U were abundant in both mycelial and 
 <italic>in planta</italic> libraries, and there was a suppression for C in mycelial libraries and for G in 
 <italic>in planta</italic> libraries (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The 5’ U preference was maintained in individual mycelial libraries – CM, MM, NS and PQ, but the CS library contained more sRNAs starting with G, closely followed by U. The suppression of C at the 5’ position was also maintained in most of the mycelial libraries except for MM and PQ (data not shown). The 5’ end nucleotide preference for the LTR class was U, and for LINE/Tad1 was both A and U (data not shown). The general pattern of abundant U and less G for sRNAs from 
 <italic>in planta</italic> libraries was reflected in the LMg0 and LMg96, while LMg72 library had abundant A and less G (data not shown).
