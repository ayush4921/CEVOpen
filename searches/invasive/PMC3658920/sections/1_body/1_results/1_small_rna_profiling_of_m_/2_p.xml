<p>The size distribution of total genome-matched reads for mycelial libraries were bimodal with peaks at 23/24 nucleotides (nt) and 26/27 nt, while distinct genome-matched reads showed a normal distribution curve with the peak at 23/24 nt (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The abundance of 24 nt reads represented 16.77% of the total population. 
 <italic>In planta</italic> libraries also had a similar pattern of abundance, but the major peak was at 26 nt followed by 24 nt for the total genome-matched reads and 22/23 nt for the distinct genome-matched reads (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Almost 12% of the sRNAs are represented by the 24 nt class. Collectively, all mycelial libraries showed the majority of sRNA peaks at 24 followed by 26 nt, whereas 
 <italic>in planta</italic> libraries showed the majority of sRNAs peaking at 26 followed by 24 nt.
