<p>We performed a cluster analysis on each 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic> supercontig, based upon the proximity-based algorithm of Lu et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] for a comparative analysis of the mycelial and 
 <italic>in planta</italic> small RNA libraries. This clustering algorithm allowed us to determine the abundance of sRNAs and their distribution across the 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic> genome by dividing the genome into a series of 500 base pair (bp) windows (clusters) and calculating the abundance of sRNAs for each cluster. The clusters are defined by fixed coordinates, which allows comparative analyses of multiple libraries and the identification of differentially regulated clusters (DRCs) in the genome. In our study, DRCs represent regions of the genome with a sRNA abundance that differs by 10-fold or more in pairwise comparisons between the libraries. All mycelial libraries were compared to CM, which resulted in a total of 477 DRCs. We examined the total number of sRNA clusters for each library and identified clusters that map to genic (which includes UTRs, introns and exons) and intergenic regions, various forms of repeat regions and transposable element regions. Out of the 477 total sRNA clusters, 251 were from genic regions, 213 were from intergenic regions and 20 were from repeat regions and transposable element regions (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The CM vs. CS comparison revealed four DRCs, indicating carbon starvation had a minimal impact on the accumulation of sRNAs. NS vs. CM and PQ vs. CM had the greatest number of intergenic and genic-associated clusters. The genic and intergenic-associated clusters were 52 and 96 for NS vs. CM, and 179 and 69 for PQ vs. CM respectively. The NS vs. CM comparison resulted in the highest number (5) of sRNAs mapping to retrotransposons and transposons, versus other comparisons. Results from the 
 <italic>in planta</italic> libraries showed that the majority of clusters associated with genes and intergenic regions, as opposed to other genomic regions, and this was similar to what was seen in the CM vs. PQ comparison. Overall, the mycelial libraries showed more small RNAs mapping to transposons and retrotransposons, compared to the 
 <italic>in planta</italic> libraries; for the latter libraries, with the exception of two clusters mapping to retrotransposons, almost everything else associated with genic regions (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).
