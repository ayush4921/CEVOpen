<p>We observed that many of the annotated tRNAs and 5S rRNAs represent a significant portion of intergenic region -associated sRNAs. In order to study these genomic features, we selected random loci of each feature and analyzed their size distribution. The results showed a bimodal distribution for sRNAs originating from a majority of the rRNA loci, with size peaks at 20 and 23/24 nt (Additional file

All analyzed 5S rRNA and tRNA loci showed sRNAs on the sense strand (data not shown). sRNAs originating from mitochondrial sequences occupied only a small proportion, comprising 0.6% and 1.2% of total and distinct genome-matched reads, respectively (TableÂ
