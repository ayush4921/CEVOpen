<p>To further characterize the sRNAs associated with retrotransposons, representative loci from major repeat classes in 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic> such as LTR/Gypsy and LINE/Tad1 retrotransposons were analyzed for their size distribution, changes under different physiological conditions, strand specificity and 5’ nt identity. Strand orientation of sRNAs was also included in our analysis because abundant antisense siRNAs are known to be associated with repeats [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and are affected by the loss of RNAi machinery [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Also, studying strand specificity is important because sRNAs originating from overlapping gene pairs or natural cis-antisense gene pairs have been shown to play an important role in salt tolerance in Arabidopsis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and gene regulation in mouse oocytes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. LTR/Gypsy retrotransposons showed major peaks at 20–23 nt and abundant sRNAs in the antisense orientation (Additional file 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Figure S2A and B). These sRNAs differentially accumulated under different physiological stress conditions; for example, one class of LTR/GYPSY retrotransposon called GYMAG2 showed a spike in sRNA accumulation during nitrogen and oxidative stress conditions that was roughly 28% and 50% higher than any other condition (Additional file 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Figure S2D). Analysis of the next most abundant major repeat class of retrotransposons, LINE/Tad1, revealed that its major peak for sRNAs based on abundance, was at 20 nt followed by 23/24 nt (Additional file 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>: Figure S3A). Similar to the LTR/Gypsy retrotransposon class, sRNAs matching to LINE/Tad1 repeats also showed differential accumulation in various physiological stress conditions, but unlike the LTR class, LINE/Tad1 sRNAs did not show a spike under any one particular condition (Additional file 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>: Figure S3C). Unlike LTR/Gypsy, sRNAs matching to LINE/Tad1 did not show abundant sRNAs in the antisense orientation (Additional file 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>: Figure S3B).
