<p>To determine whether our libraries identified repeat-associated siRNAs (known as rasiRNAs), we analyzed six different classes of repeats, and found that the majority of the sRNAs emanated from rRNA loci (89%) followed by retrotransposons (LTR/Gypsy and LINE/Tad1; 11%). Small RNAs that matched to transposons (DNA/TcMar-Pogo), simple repeats, and low complexity repeats occupied only a small fraction of the total sRNAs. Though rRNA-associated sRNAs are more abundant compared to retrotransposons-associated sRNAs, the distinct reads associated with the former were less (43%) compared to the latter (52%). The majority of sRNAs matching to protein-coding regions were in a sense orientation (77%; TableÂ
