<p>In total, taking data from all the libraries together, the majority of sRNAs were found to be associated with intergenic regions (54%), followed by repeat-containing regions (41%; Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). On the other hand, comparisons across libraries resulted in more DRCs associated with genes (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Although more total sRNAs mapped to intergenic regions compared to protein-coding regions, protein-coding regions contained a greater number of distinct sRNAs (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). This difference may be explained by the presence of repeats which have not yet been annotated, and which were not identified by the RepeatMasker repeat identification program ([

 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.repeatmasker.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.repeatmasker.org</ext-link>). Though approximately 50% of the genome codes for proteins and 7% is occupied by repeats [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], our sRNA data suggests only 4% of the total sRNAs sequenced matched to protein coding regions.
