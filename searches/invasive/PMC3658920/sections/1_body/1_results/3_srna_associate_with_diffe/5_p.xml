<p>Stress conditions altered the proportion of individual classes of sRNAs associated with different genomic features (Additional file 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>: Figure S5A). The PQ library revealed a notable reduction in both total and distinct abundance sRNAs matching to protein coding regions, compared to all the other libraries. Distinct abundance for the PQ library also showed an increase in sRNAs associated with intergenic regions, and with repeats. Another prominent difference was observed in the CS library; there was an increase in sRNAs associated with LTR Gypsy transposons, and a decrease in sRNAs associated with rRNA repeats (Additional file 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>: Figure S5C). An increase in LTR retrotransposons was also observed during infection of rice plants with
