<p>In order to confirm whether these genes might truly be under post-transcriptional regulation, we generated four sRNA biosynthetic mutants, and utilized real-time qRT-PCR to determine the expression of seven genes identified from the above analysis, namely MGG_08843.6, MGG_01596.6, MGG_04428.6, MGG_06609.6, MGG_05869.6, MGG_01439.6 and MGG_04470.6. Mutants tested included gene replacement deletions in the following loci: Dicer 1 and Dicer 2 (MGG_01541 and MGG_12357, previously generated and characterized by Kadotani et al. 2002, and hereafter referred to as 
 <italic>MoDcl-1</italic> and 
 <italic>MoDcl-2</italic>), one RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRP MGG_13453; hereafter referred to as 
 <italic>RdRP</italic>) and a double-knockout mutant in both Dicers (see Additional file 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S10">10</xref>: Figure S8 for deletion construct details, confirmation of deletions and Southern hybridization, revealing one disruption cassette per mutant line). We hypothesized that suppression of gene expression would be lifted if the genes for generating sRNAs in the fungus were no longer present, and sRNAs were no longer made. Six of the seven genes analyzed showed 1.5 to 1.9-fold increased expression over the wild type in the 
 <italic>MoDcl1</italic> mutant. The MGG_01596 gene, encoding a DNA damage response protein 
 <italic>DUN1</italic>, increased in expression in the ∆
 <italic>modcl1, modcl2/modcl1</italic> and in the ∆
 <italic>mordrp-1</italic> and was reduced in the ∆
 <italic>modcl2</italic> mutant backgrounds. The MGG_04428 gene encoding the transcription factor 
 <italic>ACE1</italic> was increased ~1.7-fold in the ∆
 <italic>modcl1</italic> background (Figure
