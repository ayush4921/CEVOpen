<p>We hypothesized that transcriptional down-regulation of genes may correlate with a plethora of sRNAs accumulating either around that gene in the intergenic spaces, or within the gene itself. In order to gain a genome-wide perspective on how transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation might be related, we compared our sRNA data to transcriptional genome data generated from 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic> under the same “stress” conditions as Mathioni et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] in their microarray study. From this dataset, we identified 98 genes associated with clusters that showed differential accumulation of sRNAs (≥ 10-fold compared to CM control), 28 and 9 of which showed a negative correlation with microarray data under PQ and NS conditions, respectively (Additional file

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). Of these, only MGG_16711.7 (earlier annotated as MGG_05869.6) coding for a hypothetical protein containing an importin-beta N-terminal domain, had many sRNAs originating from its intron.
