<p>For the 
 <italic>in planta</italic> libraries, we were most interested in sRNAs that were exclusively present at 72 hpi and/or 96 hpi (Additional file 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>: Figure S7), indicating that these fungal sRNAs might be involved in invasive growth. In order to determine whether any of these sRNAs were negatively correlated with genes from the microarray study as described above, we first selected genes associated with sRNA clusters from the comparisons of LMg0 vs. LMg72, LMg0 vs. LMg96 and LMg72 vs. LMg96 that showed a ≥ 10-fold difference. Next, their corresponding loci from the CM vs. LMg72 data were compared to the microarray study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. This resulted in 12 genes that were both down-regulated in the microarray, associated with large quantities of sRNAs (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>). For each gene, abundant sRNAs present in LMg72 and/or LMg96 were analyzed for their position, and checked for their absence in non-inoculated rice sRNA libraries (

The resultant sRNAs were largely found to be associated with exons, 5’ UTR or 3’ UTRs in a sense orientation (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>). Interestingly, one sRNA matching to MGG_08843 coding for the magnesium transporter, ALR2, was abundant at 72 hpi and present in an antisense orientation to the 5’UTR; Mathioni et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] demonstrated down-regulation of this gene during carbon starvation, as well as 
 <italic>in planta</italic> growth in rice and barley. Another gene includes the well-characterized transcription factor, 
 <italic>ACE1</italic> (MGG_04428.7); this gene is of interest, as it is known to be tightly regulated and involved in appressorial formation [
