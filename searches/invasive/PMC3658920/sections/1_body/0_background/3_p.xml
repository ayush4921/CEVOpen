<p>The carefully controlled and timed life cycle of 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic> warrants examination into both transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation. To date, endogenous small RNA species have been examined in several fungal species including the budding yeast, 
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the model ascomycete fungus and close relative of 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, 
 <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> and 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic> itself ([

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]–[
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]). The 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic> genome encodes putative RNAi pathway components consisting of two Dicer-like proteins (DCL), three Argonautes (AGO), three RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRP) and one exportin-5 [

 <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> in which both of the Dicers are redundantly involved in the silencing process [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. While the Kadotani et al. study (2004) did not find a clear role for the Magnaporthe Dicer-like-1 (MoDcl1) in the generation of siRNAs, the function of this gene is yet to be discovered. Exportin-5, which plays a role in nuclear export of pre-miRNAs in animals, was identified and deleted in 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic> and shown to have reduced pathogenicity on roots, and to complement its yeast homolog, the nucleocytoplasmic transporter Msn5 [
