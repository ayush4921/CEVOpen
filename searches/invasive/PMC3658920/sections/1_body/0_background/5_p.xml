<p>In the 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic> life cycle, transition from the biotrophic to the necrotrophic stage is likely induced by environmental cues that the fungus encounters during the pathogenic process [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Conditions encountered by the fungus during its growth in rice leaves, particularly during disease symptom expression, include nitrogen starvation, and this is regarded as one of the inductive cues for disease symptom expression during rice plant infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Starvation is also considered a key factor for inducing the germ tube tip to differentiate into an appressorium [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. These and similar studies prompted us to examine whether post-transcriptional changes occur in 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic> during exposure to different physiological stressors, as well as during several invasive stages of pathogenic growth. Recent studies on genome-wide transcriptional changes demonstrate that 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions such as nitrogen and carbon deprivation are comparable to genome-wide changes that occur during invasive plant growth [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The role of post-transcriptional control during these stresses, however, has not yet been studied. We examined small RNA profiles of 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic> during stress conditions matching those of Mathioni et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], namely, nitrogen starvation, carbon starvation, minimal media, and paraquat-induced oxidative stress. We also examined small RNA fungal profiles 
 <italic>in planta</italic> at 72 and 96 hours post inoculation (hpi), as well as mock inoculated plants. Small RNAs from certain conditions showed association with specific genomic loci; for example we observed an abundance of sRNAs associated with retrotransposons during nitrogen starvation. We also identified a small subset of genes whose transcriptional down-regulation during several of the stress conditions showed association with high numbers of sRNAs. To further examine whether this represented a true link between transcriptional and post-transcriptional control, we generated four small RNA biosynthetic fungal mutants, and performed quantitative real-time RT-PCR on this down-regulated subset of genes. These results revealed a previously unknown role for the 
 <italic>Magnaporthe Dicer-Like1</italic> (
 <italic>MoDcl1</italic>) gene.
