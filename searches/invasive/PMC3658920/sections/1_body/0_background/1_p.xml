<p>RNA silencing, the RNA-mediated suppression of a target gene in a sequence specific manner, has been described in many organisms as post-transcriptional gene silencing, RNA interference, and quelling, in plants, animals, and fungi, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These silencing pathways are involved in transposon silencing, viral defense, DNA elimination, heterochromatin formation, and post-transcriptional repression of cellular genes [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The critical steps of these pathways include production of small RNAs (sRNAs) of 19â€“27 nucleotide (nt) from structured or double-stranded RNA by RNase III-like endonucleases called Dicers, followed by loading of these sRNAs into Argonaute-containing complexes to form RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISC) that guide the cleavage of target transcripts [
