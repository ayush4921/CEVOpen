<p>The complexity of RNAi components in this fungus suggests the possible existence of multiple sRNA pathways. Though miRNAs have not been identified in 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, the published data have demonstrated numerous components of the 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic> sRNA repertoire, including small interfering (siRNA) -induced silencing of transgenes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], the presence of viral derived siRNAs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], methylguanosine-capped and polyadenylated small RNAs (CPA-sRNAs) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and sRNAs matching to repetitive elements, tRNA loci, rRNAs, protein coding genes, snRNAs and intergenic regions ([
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]; this study). Moreover, several new classes of small RNAs have been described recently in fungi, including QDE-2-interacting siRNAs (qiRNAs), microRNA-like small RNAs (milRNAs) and Dicer-independent small interfering RNAs (disiRNAs) of 
 <italic>N. crassa</italic>[
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The existence of RNAi has been demonstrated in many fungal species including pathogenic species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]â€“[
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In 
 <italic>Mucor circinelloides</italic>, production of two classes of small antisense RNAs requires a functional 
 <italic>Dcl-2</italic> gene [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].
