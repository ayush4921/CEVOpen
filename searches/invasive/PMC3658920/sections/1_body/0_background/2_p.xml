 <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> (hereafter 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic>), a filamentous fungal pathogen that causes rice blast disease, leads to severe yield losses in cultivated rice worldwide. The 
 <italic>Magnaporthe</italic>-rice pathosystem is an excellent model to study the molecular basis of pathogenesis, in part because of the economic importance and molecular and genetic tractability of both host and pathogen, availability of genome sequences and transcriptome data, and the similarity of the rice blast fungus with other cereal diseases in terms of appressorium formation and intra-cellular tissue invasion [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The blast fungus infects rice plants at all stages and all tissues – leaves, stems, nodes, panicles and roots [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Leaf infection starts with reversible attachment of conidia to the host surface. The release of spore tip mucilage from conidia forms an irreversible attachment to the surface [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Conidia then germinate and form infection structures called appressoria at the end of the germ tubes. Appressoria generate enormous amounts of turgor pressure to penetrate the outer surface of the plant, which is followed by tissue invasion and colonization resulting in disease lesions [
