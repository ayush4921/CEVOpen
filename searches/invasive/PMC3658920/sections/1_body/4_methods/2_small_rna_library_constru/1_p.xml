<p>Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, New York, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The quality of the RNA was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis and NanoDrop ND-1000. High molecular weight RNA was removed by PEG precipitation, and low molecular weight RNA was size-fractionated on a polyacrylamide gel. Gel portions corresponding to 20–30 nt were recovered and small RNA libraries were constructed by following the protocol by Lu et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>] with modifications using standard Illumina sRNA adapters. The quality of the resulting libraries was checked by subjecting an aliquot of each library to TOPO® cloning (Invitrogen, USA), and approximately 96 clones from each library were sequenced by the Sanger method. The resulting sequences were checked for the presence of adapters, size of cDNAs, and their genome match. The libraries were then sequenced using Illumina’s Genome Analyzer II (GA
 <sub>II</sub>) at the Delaware Biotechnology Institute. Adapters were removed from the resulting sequences and matched to the 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic> genome (version 6 assembly) from the Broad Institute, and reads with sequencing errors were filtered out using PERL scripts. tRNA, rRNA, snRNA or snoRNAs -matched reads were removed from the total reads, and genome-matched reads were obtained using the program Bowtie, accepting only perfect matches. From the total genome matched reads, distinct genome matched reads were calculated. The abundance of each read was normalized to 5 million units of transcripts per 5 million (TP5M) to account for the difference in the sequencing depth and to facilitate accurate comparisons across libraries. To compare the different libraries, the entire genome was divided arbitrarily into 500 bp windows/clusters based on the proximity-based algorithm ([
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]; described in the Results section). Clusters showing ≥ 10-fold difference between 2 or more libraries were selected for further cluster analysis. Repeat analysis was performed using programs namely, RepeatMasker [
