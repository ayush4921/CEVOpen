<p>Genomic DNA was removed from total RNA by TURBO® DNase treatment (Ambion, New York, USA). Reverse transcription reactions were performed with 500 ng of RNA in 20 μl reaction using High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Applied Biosystems, California, USA) by following the manufacturer’s instructions. Real time PCR was done using 5 PRIME SYBR mastermix for Real-time PCR (5 PRIME, Maryland, USA) in an Eppendorf Mastercycler using 2 μl of diluted reverse transcribed templates. All samples were repeated three times. Relative expression values were calculated using the 2
 <sup>-ΔΔCT</sup> method with GADPH (MGG_01084.6) as a housekeeping control. Primers used are listed in Additional file
