 <italic>M. oryzae</italic> wild type strain 70–15 was used in this study because of the availability of genome sequence and transcriptome data. Filter paper stocks stored at -20°C were inoculated onto Oatmeal agar plates (OM: oatmeal 50 g/L and agar 15 g/L) for germination and to establish starter cultures. Fungus grown on OM plates were transferred to complete medium (CM: 10 g sucrose, 6 g yeast extract, 6 g casamino acid and 1 mL trace elements/L) plates and subsequently to complete liquid medium. Liquid grown fungus was harvested under sterile conditions and washed with sterile distilled water. The resulting fungal mat was carefully divided into equal pieces for further exposure to physiological conditions in liquid such as complete medium (CM), minimal medium (MM), carbon starved medium (CS: MM lacking carbon source), nitrogen starved medium (NS: MM lacking nitrogen source) and a reactive oxygen species-rich environment generated by amendment of Paraquat (PQ) to the CM, as described in detail by Mathioni et al.

 <italic>M. oryzae</italic> 70–15 grown on OM plates for 10 days (d) were harvested using 0.2% gelatin. Concentration of the conidial suspension was adjusted to 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> spores/mL and 3 mL of the suspension was spray inoculated onto rice plants; leaves were harvested after 72 hours post-inoculation (hpi) and 96 hpi respectively for LMg72 and LMg96 libraries.
