<p>Gene replacement cassettes were constructed using adaptamer-mediated PCR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>]. Typically, 1.3 kb of upstream and downstream sequence of each target gene was amplified with primers that contained adaptamer sequences. A 1.4 kb fragment containing the hygromycin B phosphotransferese gene with the 
 <italic>trp</italic>C promoter from 
 <italic>A. nidulans</italic> was amplified from plasmid pCB1003 using the adaptamer sequence attached to the forward HPHF and reverse HPHR primer set (Additional file 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S11">11</xref>: Table S3). Using nested primers, three individually amplified fragments of upstream and downstream sequence and hygromycin resistance gene were combined and amplified together to construct a hygromycin cassette for gene replacement of approximately 3.3 kb in length. The hygromycin cassette was transformed into 70â€“15 protoplasts as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>]. Gene disruption mutants were identified by PCR screening using primers outside the flanking regions and gene specific primers (Additional file 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S11">11</xref>: Table S3) and further confirmed by Southern blot analysis (Additional file 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S10">10</xref>: Figure S8). For deletion of 
 <italic>MoDcl1</italic> and 
 <italic>MoDcl2</italic>, gene replacement cassettes were constructed as described previously with the modification of BAR gene, amplified from pCB1530, being used as the selectable marker [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>] in place of HYG. Gene replacement cassettes for 
 <italic>MoDcl1</italic> and 
 <italic>MoDcl2</italic> were transformed into protoplasts of 
 <italic>MoDcl2</italic> and 
 <italic>MoDcl1</italic> knockouts, respectively.
