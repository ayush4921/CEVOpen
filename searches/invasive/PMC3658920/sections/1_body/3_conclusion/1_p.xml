<p>In conclusion, various stress-inducing and 
 <italic>in planta</italic> conditions alter the sRNA profile of 
 <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, with the main effect exerted on loci associated with protein coding regions. A subset of these genes showed an association with the transcriptome data, as well as a differential accumulation of their transcripts between the two 
 <italic>Dicer</italic>-deficient mutant backgrounds. Stress conditions repressed the sRNAs associated with protein coding regions, and marginally increased the intergenic- and repeat- associated sRNAs. Considering our results and previous reports, questions of Dicer-independent mechanisms, and genetic redundancy of multiple copies of sRNA biosynthetic genes in the genome, warrant a detailed dissection of sRNA generating pathway(s) through the use of various sRNA biosynthetic mutants. Further studies on 
 <italic>in planta</italic> interaction using sRNA biosynthetic mutants would provide better understanding of molecular mechanisms behind host-pathogen interaction which in turn useful for developing novel disease control strategies.
