   <bold>Proportion of sRNAs in each size class for the environmental mycelial libraries.</bold> Proportion of sRNAs for total genome-matched reads (top panel) and distinct-genome matched reads (bottom panel). Total genome-matched reads shows a peak at 24 nt for the starvation libraries, CS and NS, while the other libraries are roughly evenly distributed. Distinct genome-matched reads shows a relatively even distribution, except for NS and PQ, which have the highest peaks between 19â€“20 nt. CM = complete media; CS = carbon starved; MM = minimal media; NS = nitrogen starved; PQ = paraquat.
