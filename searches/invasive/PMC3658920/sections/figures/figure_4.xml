   <bold>Association between transcriptional control of genes within the different environmental conditions and post-transcriptional control of the same set of genes under the same conditions.</bold> Genes from three different environmental conditions are negatively regulated in the microarray study for that condition, while they showed an abundance of small RNAs associated with the gene for that condition compared to the complete media (CM) control (
   <bold>A</bold>); Genes from four different environmental conditions were induced in the microarray for that condition, while they showed a low amount of sRNAs associated with the gene compared to the CM control (
   <bold>B</bold>). CS = carbon starved; MM = minimal media; NS = nitrogen starved; PQ = paraquat; T72 = Infected rice leaf at 72hpi.
