 <caption> Expression of selected genes in different mutant backgrounds. In order to understand the regulation of genes with a negative correlation between sRNA levels and microarray expression, seven genes were selected and analyzed in wild type and in RNAi mutant backgrounds using real time qRT-PCR; expression levels were calculated using 2 -ΔΔCT method. MoDcl1: Dicer1; MoDcl2: Dicer2; RdRP: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (MGG_13453); MoDcl2/MoDcl1: Dicer2 knock-out in a Dicer1 knock-out background (the reciprocal was also performed and showed similar results); KO: knock-out; ECT: ectopic. MGG numbers correspond to the following genes: MGG_08843 = magnesium transporter ALR2; MGG_01596 = damage-response protein DUN1; MGG_04428 = ACE1; MGG_06609 = acetyl-CoA hydrolase; MGG_05869 = importin domain-containing; MGG_01439 = inorganic phosphate transporter; MGG_04470 = nucleolar complex protein 14. </caption>
