 <caption> Proportion of sRNAs in each size class for the in planta libraries. M. oryzae - specific reads were parsed out from the total reads by aligning them to the M. oryzae genome. Top panel: Proportion of total genome-matched reads shows a peak at 26 nt for the LMg72 and LMg96 libraries. Bottom panel: Proportion of distinct genome-matched reads shows peaks at 23 and 24-nt for the in planta libraries (bottom panel). LMg0 = mock inoculated; LMg72 = 72 hpi; LMg96 = 96 hpi. </caption>
