 <caption> Additional file 9: Figure S7 Venn diagram depicting the clustering of sRNAs from LMg0, LMg72 and LMg96 libraries. The center gray area likely represents small RNAs from rice that were also found in the inoculated samples. (LMg0 = mock inoculated rice; LMg72 = 72 hpi; LMg96 = 96 hpi). </caption>
