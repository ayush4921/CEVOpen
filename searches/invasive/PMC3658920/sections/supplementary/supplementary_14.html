 <caption> Additional file 5: Figure S5 sRNAs associated with different genomic regions. Fraction of small RNA reads that associate with different genomic loci in mycelial libraries (A) and in in planta libraries (B). Proportion of individual repeat classes to total repeats in mycelial libraries (C) and in in planta libraries (D). (CM = complete media; CS = carbon starved; MM = minimal media; NS = nitrogen starved; PQ = paraquat; LMg0 = mock inoculated rice; LMg72 = 72 hpi; LMg96 = 96 hpi). </caption>
