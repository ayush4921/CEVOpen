    "An increasing global focus on neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) has resulted in the set up of numerous control and elimination activities worldwide. This is partly true for Taenia solium taeniasis/cysticercosis, the most important foodborne parasitic infection. Despite substantial progress, adequate monitoring and surveillance (M&S) are required to sustain a status of control/elimination. This is often lacking, especially for T. solium. Therefore, the objective was to conduct a systematic literature review of the currently available M&S systems at the control/elimination stage of the four top-ranked helminth NTDs. Specifically, Taenia spp., Echinococcus spp., Schistosoma spp., and soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) were considered to determine if there are any similarities between their M&S systems and whether certain approaches can be adopted from each other. The systematic review demonstrated that rigorous M&S systems have been designed for the control/elimination stage of both STHs and schistosomiasis, particularly in China. On the other hand, a concept of M&S for Taenia spp. and Echinococcus spp. has not been fully developed yet, due to a lack of epidemiological data and the fact that many endemic countries are far away from reaching control/elimination. Moreover, accurate diagnostic tools for all four diseases are still imperfect, which complicates proper M&S. Finally, there is an urgent need to develop and harmonize/standardize M&S activities in order to reliably determine and compare the epidemiological situation worldwide."
