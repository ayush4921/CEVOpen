    "<h4>Background</h4>A supramolecular complex of praziquantel (PZQ) with disodium salt of glycyrrhizic acid (Na<sub>2</sub>GA) was obtained by mechanochemical technology to increase solubility, absorption rate and hence bioavailability of the drug and reduction its therapeutic doses. The aim of our study was evaluation of anthelmintic efficacy of supramolecular complex of PZQ.<h4>Methods</h4>Different samples of PZQ with Na<sub>2</sub>GA were obtained by mechanochemical processing and examined for some physico-chemical properties. The anthelmintic activity of the most perspective samples was studied on the laboratory model of <i>Hymenolepis nana</i> infection of mice and <i>Moniezia expansa</i> infection of sheep by the results of helminthological necropsy of the small intestines (the controlled test).<h4>Results</h4>A high efficacy (> 98%) of supramolecular complex of PZQ with Na<sub>2</sub>GA (1/10) was shown at doses of 3; 2 and 1 mg/kg of body weight at single oral administration against <i>H. nana</i> in mice and <i>M. expansa</i> in sheep. While the basic PZQ had 27.19% and 36.64% efficacy respectively at the dose of 1 mg/kg. The PZQ:Na<sub>2</sub>GA 1/10 physical mixture (without mechanochemical processing) revealed no anthelmintic efficacy.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Joint mechanochemical treatment the PZQ substance and Na<sub>2</sub>GA led to increased solubility, reduction of particle sizes, amorphization of substance, incorporating it with micelles of glycyrrhizic acid and high anthelmintic efficacy in reduced dose. The supramolecular complex of praziquantel was found to be a perspective anthelminthic with enhanced pharmacological activity that needs further research."
