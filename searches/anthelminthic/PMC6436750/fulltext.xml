Surprisingly, insect-derived compounds have largely been neglected so far in the search for novel anthelminthics, despite the generally recognized high potential of insect biotechnology for drug discovery. This motivated us to assess the antischistosomal capacity of harmonine, an antimicrobial alkaloid from the harlequin ladybird <italic>Harmonia axyridis</italic> that raised high interest in insect biotechnology in recent years. We observed remarkably pleiotropic effects of harmonine on physiological, cellular, and molecular processes in adult male and female <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> at concentrations as low as 5 &#x003bc;M <italic>in vitro</italic>. This included tegumental damage, gut dilatation, dysplasia of gonads, a complete stop of egg production at 10 &#x003bc;M, and increased production of abnormally shaped eggs at 5 &#x003bc;M. Motility was reduced with an EC50 of 8.8 &#x003bc;M and lethal effects occurred at 10&#x02013;20 &#x003bc;M within 3 days of culture. Enzyme inhibition assays revealed acetylcholinesterase (AChE) as one potential target of harmonine. To assess possible effects on stem cells, which represent attractive anthelminthic targets, we developed a novel <italic>in silico</italic> 3D reconstruction of gonads based on confocal laser scanning microscopy of worms after EdU incorporation to allow for quantification of proliferating stem cells per organ. Harmonine significantly reduced the number of proliferating stem cells in testes, ovaries, and also the number of proliferating parenchymal neoblasts. This was further supported by a downregulated expression of the stem cell markers <italic>nanos-1</italic> and <italic>nanos-2</italic> in harmonine-treated worms revealed by quantitative real-time PCR. Our data demonstrate a multifaceted antischistosomal activity of the lady beetle-derived compound harmonine, and suggest AChE and stem cell genes as possible targets. Harmonine is the first animal-derived alkaloid detected to have antischistosomal capacity. This study highlights the potential of exploiting insects as a source for the discovery of anthelminthics.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Natural compounds represent one of the richest sources for the discovery of new active compounds against diseases such as cancer or infections, including helminth infections that cause the highest disease burden in tropical countries. Surprisingly, insects have been almost completely neglected with respect to anthelminthics discovery although they represent the most species-rich class of animals known on earth, producing a wide spectrum of compounds with biological activities. In insect biotechnology, the harlequin ladybird <italic>Harmonia axyridis</italic> raised high interest being a rich source of antimicrobial compounds such as the alkaloid harmonine.

The compound damaged tissues essential for survival and reproduction of schistosomes (tegument, intestine, gonads) and also affected stem-cell proliferation. Furthermore, we obtained first evidence for acetylcholinesterase as one potential molecular target, which was partially inhibited by harmonine. This is the first time to proof a direct effect of a defined insect-derived compound on a helminth parasite, a finding that will encourage further studies to explore insects as sources of novel anthelminthics.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The work was funded by the excellence initiative of the Hessian Ministry of Science, Higher Education and Art (HMWK) supporting the LOEWE Centre DRUID and awarded to CGG and SH.

From 1981 to 2010, 33% of approved drugs represented natural compounds and derivatives, mostly from plants, algae, and fungi [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In recent years, the search for novel anthelmintic compounds from natural sources has been intensified with the aim to identify new hit and lead compounds for drug development [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. So far, medicinal plants and their metabolites (like alkaloids, terpenes, and peptides) have been widely exploited as sources of novel natural compounds with anthelmintic activity. In contrast, only few studies have focused on animal-derived molecules [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Surprisingly, although insects are among the most successful and widespread organisms on earth, especially regarding their diversity and adaptability, they are still rather underrated as sources of compounds with medical importance. Along these lines, insects have been almost completely neglected with respect to anthelminthic discovery [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The chemical defense of insects against pathogens and parasites relies on effector molecules such as antimicrobial peptides and secondary metabolites. The invasive harlequin ladybird <italic>Harmonia axyridis</italic>, which is also known as Asian ladybird or Multicolored ladybird, represents an outstanding example in this regard [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Its immune system encompasses more than fifty antimicrobial peptides, the highest number ever reported for an animal [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition, its hemolymph contains extraordinarily high concentrations of the constitutively expressed antimicrobial alkaloid harmonine ((17R,9Z)&#x02010;1,17&#x02010;diaminooctadec&#x02010;9&#x02010;ene), an aliphatic, long-chain diamine which displays antimicrobial activities [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Its superior immune system promotes its invasive success in a multifaceted manner. The beetle&#x02019;s antimicrobial peptides have been demonstrated to mediate resistance against pathogenic bacteria [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], whereas harmonine has been postulated to keep its microsporidia under control. Microsporidia are highly specialized relatives of fungi that propagate as intracellular parasites in insects and other taxa [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. <italic>H</italic>. <italic>axyridis</italic> carries a high load of microsporidia which can infect and kill native competitors such as the two-spotted ladybird <italic>Adalia bipunctata</italic> and the seven-spotted ladybird <italic>Coccinella septempunctata</italic> when transmitted e.g. during intraguild predation. Therefore, these parasites have been postulated to function in invaded areas like bioweapons to successfully outcompete native competitors [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In addition, first tests against human pathogens showed that harmonine displays a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity including <italic>in vitro</italic> effects against mycobacteria as well as protozoan parasites [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Activity against helminths has so far not been investigated, even though novel active compounds are highly needed for a whole list of helminth infections, which includes neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in humans and veterinary infectious diseases [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Schistosomiasis is among the helminthic diseases causing highest disability and mortality in humans worldwide [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In endemic areas, schistosomiasis occurs as a chronic disease, which derives from the longevity of blood-resident adult schistosomes persisting many years in the host. Pathology is mainly caused by tissue deposition of eggs which are produced in hundreds per day by the female worm [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Approximately 700 million people are at risk of schistosomiasis [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and there is no vaccination that might prevent infection. Treatment relies on a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ). PZQ is active against all three major schistosome species, <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic>, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>haematobium</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>japonicum</italic>, it can be produced at low cost and is well tolerated. It is therefore used in mass treatment programs and as preventive chemotherapy for people at high risk [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This and its continued use since the 1980s have increased the risk of resistance development. Indeed, evidence was obtained for schistosomes with lowered PZQ susceptibility in human drug administration programs and in experimental animal models [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, finding alternative treatment options has become an urgent issue [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Due to their outstanding species number and diversity, insects constitute a huge &#x0201c;drug cabinet&#x0201d; to be explored which might also include novel compounds with anthelmintic activity. To make a start, we focused in our study on the antimicrobial alkaloid compound harmonine derived from the harlequin ladybird. The aim of this study was to reveal whether this insect-derived compound shows anthelmintic capacity against adult <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> worms. By physiological, cellular, and molecular analyses we observed a complex multifaceted phenotype comprising tegumental damage, gut dilatation, gonadal dysplasia, egg-production deficits as well as cellular and molecular effects on stem cells. Furthermore, we found first evidence for AChE as one potential target. With the results of our study, we want to promote insect-derived compounds and move them into spot-light as possible sources of new drugs in the treatment of schistosomiasis and further parasitic diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials &#x00026; methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Animal experiments were performed in accordance with the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes (ETS No 123; revised Appendix A) and have been approved by the Regional Council (Regierungspraesidium) Giessen (V54-19 c 20/15 c h 02 GI 18/10Nr.

Indeed, sublethal concentrations of 5 and 10 &#x003bc;M harmonine reduced the number of proliferating cells in both ovaries and testes compared to organs of control worms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007240.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). In order to quantify the number of proliferating stem cells per organ as an objective measure, we established a procedure to separate gonads <italic>in silico</italic> from the surrounding worm tissue with the help of the analysis software IMARIS. 3D visualization of ovaries revealed that proliferating stem cells are exclusively located in the anterior part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007240.g007">Fig 7</xref>). In addition, stem cells are not homogeneously nested between oogonia, but preferentially located at the outer edge of the organ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007240.g007">Fig 7C and 7D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007240.s004">S1 Movie</xref>). Next, we determined the percentage of EdU-positive stem cells per total Hoechst-positive cells for each ovary or testis. The percentage of proliferating stem cells per organ was significantly reduced in harmonine-treated worms compared to control worms. While control ovaries and testes showed on average 30% and 47% EdU-positive cells, respectively, the percentage dropped to 5% and 7% after exposure to harmonine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007240.g008">Fig 8A&#x02013;8D</xref>). This resulted in a merely scattered distribution of stem cells within the gonads.

Remarkably, we found that harmonine affected not just one or few, but all of these parameters simultaneously.</p><p>Our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies showed that harmonine reduced the motility of adult worms in a dose-dependent manner, with an EC50 of 8.8 &#x003bc;M and lethality at 10&#x02013;20 &#x003bc;M within 3 days of culture. These effective concentrations are desirably low, also compared to other natural compounds with described schistosomicial activity, many of which were found to be active in the range of 50&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;M and even higher [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Motor activity alterations belong to the most important indicators of schistosomicidal activity. If the neuromuscular system is affected, mating may be disrupted because the female is released from the gynaecophoric canal of the male partner which eventually leads to degeneration of the female and a complete cessation of egg production [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In addition, intact muscle function is required for the suckers to allow the worm to attach to the host endothelial wall, and for functionality of the digestive, reproductive and excretory organs which are lined by musculature [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Indeed, harmonine-treated male and female worms separated from each other, were unable to attach with their suckers to the culture well, and stopped egg production at 10 &#x003bc;M. <italic>In vivo</italic>, reduced motor activities would very likely result in removal and degradation of worms by the host and, because egg production is affected, to reduced pathology and the interruption of transmission.</p><p>Harmonine also caused adverse effects on the tegument at concentrations as low as 5 &#x003bc;M, which plays crucial roles for nutrient uptake, secretion, osmoregulation, and immune evasion [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Damage of the tegument could facilitate the penetration of schistosomicide compounds but also of antibodies to deeper-lying tissues, which may culminate in greater damage to the parasite including disruption of the above-mentioned physiological processes and the ultimate elimination of worms [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].

Tegumental damage is also induced by PZQ, which may contribute to the compound&#x02019;s efficacy [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Previous work showed the induction of early necrosis in <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites, which involved the loss of cell-membrane integrity [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Also in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic>, induction of necrosis might contribute to the detrimental effects of harmonine.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>AChE as possible target</title><p>Besides the tegument, the nervous system of helminths has been considered a promising target for drug discovery. Several components of the neuronal system are targets of currently approved anthelminthics, including monepantel, levamisole and pyrantel [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. We found a reduction of schistosomal AChE activity and of AChE transcript levels by harmonine, which suggests two molecular mechanisms that contribute to the observed motility reduction and subsequent paralysis of the parasite&#x02019;s musculature. We conclude that the reduced enzymatic activity in schistosome protein extracts is not exclusively a consequence of reduced gene transcription, because worms used to prepare extracts have not been treated with harmonine, instead harmonine was added directly to the enzyme assay. According to diverse studies in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic>, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>haematobium</italic>, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>japonicum</italic>, and S. <italic>bovis</italic>, AChE fulfills two different functions: a classical role in the neuromuscular system for motor activity, and a non-classical role in the tegument related to glucose import from host blood [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The tegumental damage observed in harmonine-treated worms might be correlated with the high tegumental expression of AChE [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], while the observed paralysis might be linked to the neuromuscular role. At cholinergic synapses, the neurotransmitter ACh binds to nicotinic ACh receptors (AChRs) and thereby mediates muscular contraction via membrane depolarization. AChE plays a central role in the termination of transmission by hydrolysis of ACh. Treatment of adult schistosomes with either ACh agonists or inhibition of AChE (resulting in higher levels of ACh) led to excessive stimulation, desensitization, and flaccid paralysis of worms [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. If harmonine inhibits AChE, this should likewise induce paralysis. Indeed, this was observed in our study. To clarify whether the antischistosomal effects of harmonine are mainly due to targeting of AChE, a gradual knock-down of AChE expression to a similar degree as found for the reduction of AChE activity by harmonine might be of interest for future work. While we found a generally high expression and enzymatic activity of AChE in males and unpaired females, both parameters were strongly decreased in paired females. This might reflect a reduced need in motor activity of the female after pairing and/or a different need for AChE-mediated glucose uptake. Up-and down-regulation of genes in females after pairing and separation, respectively, is a known phenomenon [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. We also found other genes involved in the function of the neuromuscular synapse being downregulated, such as genes annotated as nicotinic AChR (Smp_176310, Smp_139330, Smp_180570) and as choline acetyltransferase (Smp_146910), the enzyme involved in ACh synthesis [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Altogether, it seems likely this contributes to a reduced motor activity of females after pairing. Our findings of a sex- and pairing-dependent AChE expression and activity pattern adds novel aspects to the wealth of data on AChE function in schistosome biology, and might explain why females appeared less sensitive than males towards harmonine during the first 24 h of treatment.</p><p>The druggability of AChE was demonstrated by the use of the AChE inhibitor metrifonate against <italic>S</italic>. <italic>haematobium</italic> in the past [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, metrifonate was withdrawn from the market because of the need for multiple doses, its toxicity to the host, and its unsatisfying efficacy against other schistosome species [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Nonetheless, AChE remains an interesting antischistosomal target for rational drug design.

Also for harmonine, rational drug design might be used to obtain even better efficacies.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Schistosome stem cells as targets</title><p>Our conclusion that there are further harmonine targets beyond AChE is based on three observations: (1) the merely weak AChE inhibitory capacity of harmonine, (2) the multifaceted phenotypes observed after treatment with harmonine, and (3) effects by the AChE inhibitor metrifonate that were different in strength involving a rapid paralysis within only 1&#x02013;3 hours, which was reversible [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Additional targets might be related to stem-cell biology. Due to the fundamental role of stem cells in the parasite life cycle and parasite survival, it was recently proposed that many helminth infections may be considered as stem cell diseases [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Compounds targeting stem cells are thus particularly attractive candidates for drug development. In order to not only assess but objectively quantify stem cell effects, we established a 3D reconstruction approach of schistosome ovaries and testes to quantify proliferating stem cells. Harmonine significantly reduced the number of proliferating stem cells in gonadal tissues and the parenchyma where they are known as neoblasts [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Furthermore, we used for the first time quantification of <italic>nanos</italic> gene expression as a measure for compound-induced effects. <italic>Nanos-1</italic> was characterized as a germline-specific stem cell marker in adult <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] and is known as a conserved regulator of germ cell development [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Somatic stem cells, so-called neoblasts, were only recently identified in adult schistosomes and are characterized by expression of <italic>nanos-1</italic> and <italic>nanos-2</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. <italic>Nanos-2</italic> is a post-transcriptional regulator responsible for the formation, development, and maintenance of pluripotent cells in many metazoans [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Knock-down of <italic>nanos-1</italic> and <italic>nanos-2</italic> in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> resulted in loss of mature germ cells and in degenerated testes, and it was concluded that <italic>nanos-1</italic> and <italic>nanos-2</italic> are required for germ-cell differentiation [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Since the levels of <italic>nanos</italic> expression were reduced upon harmonine treatment, one could speculate about a reduction of total stem cell numbers by induction of cell death. However, it is not clear whether <italic>nanos</italic> expression might also be affected in alive but cell cycle-arrested stem cells. Therefore, it remains open whether harmonine induces cell-cycle arrest or cell death in gonadal and somatic stem cells. In the case of cell-cycle arrest, removal of harmonine before EdU addition to the culture would lead to a resumption of cell proliferation and may clarify this question.</p><p>AChE as the target of harmonine in schistosomal stem cells is another attractive hypothesis. Indeed, according to previous RNAseq analyses, transcripts of a variety of ACh receptors were found in ovaries and testes of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], suggesting a non-neuronal role of the AChE-ACh-AChR axis in gonads. In addition, AChE is known to be expressed in certain stem cells where it regulates cell proliferation. For instance, embryonic stem cells of human and mouse express AChE and showed reduced proliferation upon ACh stimulation [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], just like an ACh over-abundance by inhibition of AChE activity might do. Furthermore, inhibition of AChE by organophosphates in mesenchymal stem cells or by donezepil in neural stem cells led to suppression of proliferation, differentiation and self-renewal ability [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Therefore, future studies should address the possible role of ACh signaling in schistosomal stem cells in detail, and we propose RT-qPCR analysis of sorted stem cells as a start. This might reveal new insights into AChE function in schistosomes and aid in developing novel therapies.</p><p>As a side note, it appears biologically astonishing how <italic>H</italic>. <italic>axyridis</italic> is able to resist the toxic potential of harmonine which accumulates in the hemolymph up to 7 &#x003bc;g per mg body mass [<xref rid="pntd.0007240.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

In summary, this study provided clear evidence for the antischistosomal activity of the lady beetle-derived compound harmonine together with biologically highly interesting effects on AChE activity, inhibition of stem-cell proliferation and gene expression. This is the first time to proof a direct effect of a defined insect-derived compound on schistosomes, and harmonine may serve as basis for the development of new antischistosomal, or even broader antiparasitic compounds. This study highlights the potential of exploiting insects for the discovery of anthelminthics and motivates the screening of insect compound libraries for novel anthelminthic compounds in the future.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007240.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Carboxyl-esterase domains in AChE orthologs of <italic>S. mansoni</italic>.</title><p>PFAM domains were revealed by the online-tool SMART (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/">http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/</ext-link>).</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0007240.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007240.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Characterization of AChE activity.</title><p><bold>(A-D)</bold> Inhibition of enzymatic activity by the AChE inhibitor physostigmine.
