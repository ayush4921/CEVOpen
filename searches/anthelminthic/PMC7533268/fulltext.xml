After extraction of the roots with 80% hydro methanol, the crude extract was evaluated for its peripheral and central analgesic activities using acetic acid-induced writhing test and hot plate method, respectively, while its anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated using carrageenan- and formalin-induced paw edema. The extract was evaluated at 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg doses. The positive control groups were treated with ASA 150 mg/kg for writhing test, morphine 10 mg/kg for hot plat method, indomethacin 25 mg/kg and diclofenac 10 mg/kg for paw edema tests and vehicle, distilled water (10 mL/kg) treated mice were assigned as negative controls.

It may therefore be worthwhile scientifically investigating the analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities of the root extract of <italic>E. kebericho</italic> M. in the mice model to substantiate its claimed traditional use.</p><p>Acetic acid-induced writhing test was selected to detect the peripheral analgesic activity of the extract. Because of its sensitivity and ability to detect antinociceptive effects of natural products and test compounds at dose levels which remains inactive for other methods, acetic acid-induced writhing test is a well recommended model for screening the peripheral analgesic potentials of test compounds.<xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid causes irritation and stimulation of the peritoneal cavity that triggers the synthesis and release of various endogenous inflammatory mediators such as histamine, serotonin, bradykinin substance P, and PGs.<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> These various endogenous inflammatory mediators elicited chemical-induced visceral pain which is characterized by constriction of abdominal muscles together with the extension of the forelimbs and elongation of the body. That is why the acetic acid-induced writhing test is considered as a model of visceral pain.<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> This model has also been associated with increased level of PGE and PGF<sub>2</sub>a. Increasing PG levels within the peritoneal cavity enhances inflammatory pain by increasing capillary permeability and activating primary afferent nociceptors.<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p><italic>Echinops kebericho</italic> extract at all doses employed (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) significantly (p &#x0003c; 0.01, and p &#x0003c; 0.001) showed peripheral analgesic activities by reducing the number of writhing with the respective values of 31.01%, 48.43%, 57.84% as compared with the negative control. These findings confirmed that the peripheral analgesic activity of the extract increased from the lower dose (100 mg/kg) to the higher dose (400 mg/kg) in dose dependent manner. The increase in analgesic activity with increasing doses of the extract might be attributed with an increase in concentration of phytoconstituents that possess analgesic activity with the maximum dose.</p><p>The possible mechanism by which the extract produced peripheral analgesia in this model might be associated with inhibiting the synthesis and release of various endogenous inflammatory mediators and suppression of sensitivity of peripheral nociceptors in the peritoneal free nerve endings for chemical-induced pain. These proposed mechanisms are in line with the principles that stated, any agent that decreases the number of writhing will demonstrate analgesia by inhibiting the synthesis and release of PGs, and by inhibiting the peripheral pain transmission.<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p><p>The second model used was the hot plate test, in which the supra-spinal nociception and the involvement of central antinociceptive mechanism were detected.<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Since the paws of mice are very sensitive to heat at temperatures which are not damaging the skin, the central antinociceptive mechanisms of the extract were detected by introducing the mice to the constantly heated plate and by observing the reaction times, namely jumping, withdrawal, and licking of the paws. The time until these responses occured was prolonged after administration of centrally-acting analgesics.<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><p>This model was selected to evaluate the central analgesic potential of the extract because of its sensitivity to strong analgesics, limited tissue damage with a cutoff time of 15 sec, which is usually applied to limit the amount of time the mouse spends on the hot plate. The model also requires less time and measurements are usually accurate.<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>The extract at all test doses (100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg) significantly (p &#x0003c; 0.05, p &#x0003c; 0.01, p &#x0003c; 0.001 respectively) elevated the pain threshold by increasing the reaction time starting from 30 min of observation onwards as compared to the negative control. The maximum analgesic effects of the extract were observed at 120 min of observation time with their respective percentage values of 63.93%, 66.94%, 69.40% as compared with morphine (10 mg/kg) which showed a percentage analgesic value of 70.81% at this time. At all times of observation, the doses of the extract showed analgesic activities in dose dependent manner. The doses of the extract took longer time (peak time) to attain for maximal effect, which for all doses was 120 min. This delay may be due to a probable time lag for the drug to enter in to the central compartment and distribute into the target site or formation of active metabolites that are endowed with analgesic activity with better half-life. A relatively better action of 400 mg/kg at all observation time may be attributed by the presence of high concentration of active metabolites.</p><p>The possibly proposed mechanism of central analgesic effects of the extract may be by activating the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) to release endogenous peptides (i.e., endorphin or enkephalin). These endogenous peptides descend the spinal cord and function as inhibitors of the pain impulse transmission at the synapse in the dorsal horn or via peripheral mechanisms involved in the inhibition of PG, leukotriene, and other endogenous substances that are key players in central pain transmission.<xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>Previous phytochemical screening on <italic>EK</italic> has revealed the presence of alkaloids, polyphenols, saponins, phytosterols, carotenoids, lignans, sesquiterpene alcohols, acetylenic and thiophene compounds, terpenoids, and essential oil.<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> It is proved that the root extract of <italic>EK</italic> contained secondary metabolites including saponin, tannin, alkaloids, phenols, flavonoids, glycosides and steroids by preliminary phytochemical screening in the present study. So, it can be said that the analgesic effects shown by the extract may be due to the presence of these aforementioned and currently identified phytoconstituents.<xref rid="cit0034">34</xref> This suggestion is in line with the reports that stated, phytoconstituents like, alkaloids, flavonoids, steroids, and tannin isolated from medicinal plants have been reported to possess a significant analgesic activity.<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>In the study of the anti-inflammatory activity, the root extract of <italic>EK</italic> was detected against carrageenan-induced acute and formalin-induced sub-acute phases of inflammation. Since the inflammatory response is a polyphasic tissue reaction, which involves both short lived increase in vascular permeability and prolonged cellular infiltration and proliferation, it is important to evaluate the potential of the extract for anti-inflammatory effect via a sequential test valid for various phases of inflammation.<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Carrageenan-induced hind paw edema is a prototype model which is employed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory potentials of various natural and synthetic products as well as to determine the possible mechanisms involved in inflammation.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Carrageenan is a phlogistic, non-antigenic agent and is devoid of apparent systemic effect, it is also believed that the experimental model exhibited a high degree of reproducibility in acute phase inflammation. Thus, carrageenan-induced paw edema, is a frequently used method for the screening of acute inflammatory potentials of various natural products.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>In the present study, acute inflammation was induced by sub planar injection of carrageenan (1%v/v in normal saline) in the left hind paws of the mice. Following the induction of carrageenan, an acute localized inflammation was induced through sequential release of various endogenous inflammatory mediators. The release of these endogenous mediators was biphasic. The early phase (0 and 2.5 h) after carrageenan induction is mainly mediated by the release of histamine, serotonin, and bradykinin. These mediators are attributed for inflammation by increasing vascular permeability in the damaged tissue surroundings. The late phase which is sustained by the overproduction of COX-2 and its pro-inflammatory PGs product, with infiltration of polymorphonuclear leucocytes (neutrophils), took place 2.5&#x02013;6hrs post carrageenan induction.<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> There are also other chemicals mediators released during the late phase of inflammation such as, oxygen-derived free radicals like superoxide anion (O<sup>2-</sup>) and hydroxyl radicals (OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup>), nitric oxide (NO) which play an important role in the development and progression of acute inflammation.<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p>The extract at all test doses employed (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) significantly (p &#x0003c; 0.05, p &#x0003c; 0.01 and p &#x0003c; 0.001 respectively) decreased the formation of edema starting from 1 hr post carrageenan induction and the effects persisted (p &#x0003c; 0.001) till the 4<sup>th</sup> hr of observation. The effect of the extract started from the 1<sup>st</sup> phase (1 hr) and continued till the 4<sup>th</sup> hr (second phase) of inflammation. This observation suggested that bioactive constituents in the extract may suppress both phases of acute inflammation by interfering with the release and/or activity of the chemical mediators.</p><p>The maximum percentage of edema inhibition by all doses of the extract was observed at the 4<sup>th</sup> time of observation with the respective values of 54.65%, 61.54% and 70.00%.

Increasing edema inhibition of the extract as the dose increased can be explained by the possible existence of an adequate concentration of the active metabolite(s) in the maximum dose level (400 mg/kg) when compared to the lower and middle (100 and 200 mg/kg) dose levels of the extract and by the quick metabolism and elimination of the effective phytoconstituents present in inadequate concentrations in the lower and middle dose levels. The observed effects of the extract may be through anti-proliferative activities against fibroblasts, inhibition of infiltrations of neutrophils and macrophages, and antagonizing the migration of leucocytes and phagocytes in to the area of inflammation.<xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p>The anti-inflammatory action of <italic>E. kebericho</italic> extract in the present study can be supported by previous reports from scientific journals that stated plants which contain mainly alkaloids, flavonoids, saponin, and tannins phenolic compound, glycosides, coumarins and triterpenoid chemical constituents showed strong anti-inflammatory effects.
