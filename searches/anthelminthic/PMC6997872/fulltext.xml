Methanolic extract of <italic>I. oblongifolia</italic> leaf was obtained and the total phenolics and flavonoids in ILE were determined. The anthelmintic study was carried out to determine the time to paralysis and time to death of worms using three doses (100, 200, and 300&#x000a0;mg/mL) of ILE. Also, Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion susceptibility method was used to determine the antimicrobial activity of ILE. The results showed that ILE induces paralysis and death of <italic>A. caliginosa</italic> at all concentration tested faster than the reference drug, Albendazole. Additionally, ILE exhibited prominent antimicrobial activity against all gram-positive bacteria tested but almost no significant activity against the gram-negative bacteria, except <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>.

Helminthiasis, an infestation of helminths in the body, is a neglected tropical disease that mostly affects people in poor countries. In addition, helminths are widely prevalent in livestock, subsequently causing losses in the agricultural sector (<xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">McSorley and Maizels, 2012</xref>). Several studies have already reported that helminths cause long-term chronic infections in both humans and animals by regulating immune-mediated inflammation (<xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">Elliott et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">Elliott and Weinstock, 2012</xref>). However, the complete eradication of helminth infection remains a distant goal, due to the lack of effective vaccines, limited pharmacological efficacy of current drugs, emerging drug resistance, and rapid reinfection in environments where transmission cannot be interrupted.</p><p id="p0010">The overuses of antibiotics induce a rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens.

However, there is no information reported thus far about anthelmintic activity and the antimicrobial activity of the leaf extract of <italic>I. oblongifolia,</italic> whereas different studies have reported the antimicrobial activities of the leaf extract of other <italic>Indigofera</italic> species. Our results are similar to other findings regarding the antibacterial activity of leaf extract of <italic>I. tinctoria</italic>, which exhibits inhibitory activity against gram-positive bacteria (<italic>B. cereus, S. pneumoniae,</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>) but not against gram-negative bacteria (<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and <italic>E. coli</italic>) (<xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">Renukadevi et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and yeast were not tested in the study (<xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">Renukadevi et al., 2011</xref>). <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">Esimone et al. (1999)</xref> reported the antimicrobial activity of the aqueous extract of <italic>I. dendroides</italic> leaves against gram-positive bacteria (<italic>S. aureus and Bacillus subtilis</italic>), gram-negative bacteria (<italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>), and fungal species (<italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic>) (<xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">Esimone et al., 1999</xref>). Indeed, our and others&#x02019; results are consistent with the fact that Gram-negative bacteria are more resistant to antibodies and antibiotics than Gram-positive bacteria due to the existence of the large impermeable cell wall (<xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">Silhavy et al., 2010</xref>). K. pneumoniae is known as capsulated bacterium. Although the capsule of thid Gram-negative bacteria forms the major physical barrier between inside and outside of the bacterial cell, the capsule contents (lipopolysaccharide, O-antigen and lipid A) of the bacteria might serve as a target for antimicrobial compounds. For example, cationic antimicrobial peptides can disrupt the electrostatic interactions between lipid A moieties and subsequently disrupt bacterial outer membrane (<xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">Doorduijn et al., 2016</xref>). Our results showed that ILE is an effective anthelmintic and antibacterial agent. Further studies are required to specifically isolate the active compound(s), test broad range of pathogens and elucidate its mechanism of action.</p></sec><sec id="s0050"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0095"><funding-source id="gp005">The work is supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University for funding this research group project No RG-198.</funding-source></p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of Competing Interest</title><p id="p0100">The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bi005"><title>References</title><ref id="b0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="h0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abdel Moneim</surname><given-names>A.E.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title><italic>Indigofera oblongifolia</italic> prevents lead acetate-induced hepatotoxicity, oxidative stress, fibrosis and apoptosis in rats</article-title><source>PLoS One</source><volume>11</volume><year>2016</year><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">e0158965</object-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b0010"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="h0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ajaiyeoba</surname><given-names>E.O.</given-names></name><name><surname>Onocha</surname><given-names>P.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Olarenwaju</surname><given-names>O.T.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>In vitro anthelmintic properties of Buchholzia coriaceae and Gynandropsis gynandra extracts</article-title><source>Pharm.
