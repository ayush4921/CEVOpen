A reliable quantification of gene expression in all parasite life stages relevant for targeting by anthelmintics in the mammalian host is fundamental. The aim of this study was to define a set of stably expressed reference genes for qRT-PCR in <italic>Fasciola</italic> studies. We determined the expression stabilities of eight candidate reference genes by the algorithms NormFinder, geNorm, BestKeeper, and comparative &#x00394;CT method. The most stably expressed reference genes for the comparison of intra-mammalian life stages were glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (Fh<italic>eprs</italic>) and tubulin-specific chaperone D (Fh<italic>tbcd</italic>). The two best reference genes for analysis of <italic>in vitro</italic>-cultured juveniles were Fh<italic>tbcd</italic> and proteasome subunit beta type-7 (Fh<italic>psmb7</italic>). These genes should replace the housekeeping gene <italic>gapdh</italic> which is used in most <italic>Fasciola</italic> studies to date, but in fact was differentially expressed in our analysis. Based on the new reference genes, we quantified expression of five kinases (Abl1, Abl2, PKC, Akt1, Plk1) discussed as targets in other parasitic flatworms.

The life cycle of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>hepatica</italic> is complex and includes a snail as an intermediate host and a mammal as a definitive host. The fluke develops through multiple stages: from eggs to miracidia, sporocysts, rediae, cercariae, metacercariae, newly excysted juveniles (NEJs), and immature flukes which eventually reach the adult stage. Molecular research on this and other helminths has considerably advanced in recent years, with genome data and tools such as RNA interference (RNAi) becoming available for these complex multicellular organisms. Relative quantification of gene expression by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is an essential component of many experimental approaches. The accuracy of such relative gene expression analyses is largely dependent on the stable expression of the reference genes used for normalisation. Housekeeping genes are typically used as reference in qRT-PCR, although in some cases their expression is known to vary in helminths depending on the experimental condition, the parasite stage, or the parasite&#x02019;s sex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Classical housekeeping genes such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (<italic>gapdh</italic>) and <italic>&#x000df;-actin</italic> have often been used based on tradition rather than being experimentally validated as stably expressed genes for the species or parasite stage of interest. However, the validation of expression stabilities of reference genes under the desired experimental conditions is an essential step, which should precede any comparative studies on expression levels of target genes.</p><p id="Par3">Comparative gene expression analysis in different life-stages is of major interest in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>hepatica</italic> research. This includes for instance the validation of expression of potential drug target genes. A new active compound should ideally target all life stages within the final host, including NEJs emerging from metacercariae in the host&#x02019;s intestine, immature flukes migrating through the body cavity to the liver capsule and through the liver parenchyma causing acute fascioliasis, and adult flukes, which trigger chronic fascioliasis while residing inside the bile ducts where egg deposition occurs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Gene expression often varies between intra-mammalian life stages of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>hepatica</italic> as metabolic, nutritional and locomotor demands vary between stages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Other research approaches include the <italic>in vitro</italic> culture of flukes, such as the recently established <italic>in vitro</italic> maturation of NEJs to immature flukes in order to study early development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, or RNAi-mediated knockdown of gene expression which might involve culture for more than 3 weeks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Gene expression stability in parasites during <italic>in vitro</italic> culture is likely to differ from non-cultured parasites, because of the known differences from the <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions compared to the natural environment provided by the host. This motivated us to identify reference genes with stable expression in the intra-mammalian life stages and during <italic>in vitro</italic> culture of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>hepatica</italic>. To this end, we used four different algorithms to assess eight different candidate reference genes and their expression stability in the relevant <italic>in vivo</italic>-stages (NEJs, 4 week-old immature flukes, 12-week old adults), and in juvenile flukes cultured for 4 weeks <italic>in vitro</italic>. Out of these candidate genes, three were identified as the most stably expressed reference genes.</p><p id="Par4">As a first application example, we utilised these selected reference genes to determine the expression level of potentially druggable target genes in the different life stages and during <italic>in vitro</italic> culture. Kinases are discussed as promising drug targets in parasitic flatworms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. For instance, promising anthelmintic effects were observed in immature and adult schistosomes by RNAi or inhibitor treatment against Abelson (Abl) tyrosine kinases and polo-like kinases (PLK)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Surprisingly, in <italic>Fasciola</italic> research, kinases as drug targets have been largely neglected so far although new anthelmintics are urgently needed facing the spread of triclabendazole resistance around the globe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. We have identified five kinase orthologs in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>hepatica</italic> and characterised their expression by qRT-PCR. Based on the new reference genes, an interesting change in kinase expression patterns during fluke development was obtained. This may substantiate further research activity on kinases in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>hepatica</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Selection of candidate reference genes</title><p id="Par5">Eight different candidate reference genes were chosen among which we assumed to find stably expressed reference genes suitable for the quantification of gene expression independent from the parasite stage or <italic>in vitro</italic> cultivation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The candidates were selected based on already available transcriptome datasets or literature on related trematode species. The candidate reference gene names, biological function and accession numbers are listed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. In detail, orthologs of two of the genes were previously shown to be stably expressed in selected life stages of the Chinese liver fluke <italic>Clonorchis sinensis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>: &#x003b2;-actin (<italic>actb</italic>) and small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (<italic>snrpa1</italic>). Another two candidate genes were chosen because previous transcriptome analyses suggested a stable expression of their orthologs in all life stages of the blood fluke <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>: tubulin-specific chaperone D (<italic>tbcd</italic>) and protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit beta (<italic>ppp1cb</italic>).

Finally, for comparison, we included the well-known housekeeping gene <italic>gapdh</italic>, which is currently widely used for normalisation also in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>hepatica</italic> studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Thus, all reference gene candidates play roles in conserved cellular processes like mRNA splicing and translation, cytoskeleton arrangement, glycolysis, mitochondrial organisation, and the regulation of cell growth (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

The presence of relevant conserved protein domains was confirmed by SMART analysis (see Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>).

A good reference gene is characterised by an M value below 1 in heterogeneous cell or tissue sample sets (Vandesompele 2002). NormFinder identified the tRNA-synthetase Fh<italic>eprs</italic> and the proteasome subunit Fh<italic>psmb7</italic> as the two best candidates, whereas Fh<italic>gapdh</italic> turned out to be the least stably transcribed gene in a combined analysis of all fluke stages (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>).

Phosphofructokinase seems to be the only kinase of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>hepatica</italic> studied as potential chemotherapeutic target, in work by Mansour dating back as far as 1962<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, but was not further followed because of suboptimal <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy of an phosphofructokinase inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. To move kinases more into the spotlight of <italic>Fasciola</italic> anthelmintics research, we identified five kinase genes in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>hepatica</italic> and quantified their expression during development at the transcriptional level, <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. For orthologs of all these kinases, promising anthelmintic effects have been obtained <italic>in vitro</italic> by knockdown of kinase gene expression or kinase inhibitor treatment in other parasitic flatworms including <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Our analyses showed that these kinases were expressed in all intra-mammalian stages of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>hepatica</italic>. Furthermore, interesting expression patterns were detected throughout development. The potential polo-like kinase 1 ortholog Fh<italic>plk1</italic> was found to be highly expressed in adults but low in NEJs or immature flukes. This might suggest a role of Fh<italic>plk1</italic> particularly for the mature stage. A similar expression pattern was observed in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic>, where Sm<italic>plk1</italic> expression was mainly found in germinal cells of adult worms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Accordingly, inhibition or RNAi of Sm<italic>plk1</italic> affected egg production and gonad morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Opposite to Fh<italic>plk1</italic>, orthologs of the two Abl kinases and two serine/threonine-protein kinases showed a peak of expression in NEJ. In other organisms, these kinases are amongst others involved in cytoskeleton remodeling in response to extracellular stimuli such as growth factors, and in the regulation of cell metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Thus, these kinases might play important roles during early growth and development of flukes, which still has to be substantiated in functional studies in the future.</p><p id="Par27">That kinases were found to be expressed in all intra-mammalian stages appears as a prerequisite for any novel target in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>hepatica</italic>, because new compounds should preferably be able to hit all developmental stages in the final host, as does the current gold standard triclabendazole<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Whether the significantly different mRNA expression levels between parasite stages found for most kinases will lead to a difference in susceptibility to target inhibition should be part of future studies. A first target gene validation can be achieved by knockdown using RNAi. For such an <italic>in vitro</italic> culture experiment, it should be taken into account that according to our findings, kinase transcript levels significantly change during 4 weeks of culture. Furthermore, for all studied kinases, inhibitor treatment <italic>in vitro</italic> has revealed anthelmintic effects on other parasitic flatworms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Thus, it is certainly worth testing several of the known kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib and BI 2536, against the different stages of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>hepatica</italic> in near future. To this end, first results obtained by us indicate that imatinib has also the potential of killing <italic>Fasciola in vitro</italic> (Haeberlein, unpublished results).</p><p id="Par28">To conclude, for future expression analyses by qRT-PCR in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>hepatica</italic> we propose using the glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase Fh<italic>eprs</italic> and tubulin-specific chaperone D Fh<italic>tbcd</italic> as reference genes for studies dealing with the different intra-mammalian fluke stages. Beyond that, we suggest using Fh<italic>tbcd</italic> and the proteasome subunit beta type-7 Fh<italic>psmb7</italic> for studies on <italic>in vitro</italic>-cultured juvenile flukes, such as for RNAi experiments. Especially for inter-stage comparisons, these new reference genes have the potential to replace the traditional housekeeping gene <italic>gapdh</italic> which is used in many <italic>Fasciola</italic> studies to date<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, but turned out to be differentially expressed during fluke development in our analysis. We also like to motivate, as a good laboratory practice, to newly validate the suitability of reference genes for studies that use different experimental setups than ours, such as extended drug treatment studies. Using the newly defined reference genes from our study, we quantified expression of kinase orthologs in all relevant intra-mammalian life stages important for drug targeting, which revealed distinct expression patterns throughout development pointing to interesting biological functions. Together with the previously identified broad anthelminthic activity of some kinase inhibitors, this motivates for validation experiments on kinases as potential targets in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>hepatica</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="Par29">Animal experiments were performed in accordance with the German Animal Welfare act in addition to national and international guidelines for animal welfare and were approved by the ethics commission of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the German Lower Saxony State Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety (<italic>Niedersaechsisches Landesamt f&#x000fc;r Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit</italic>) under reference number 33.8-42502-05-118A336.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Parasites</title><p id="Par30">Metacercariae from an Italian strain of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>hepatica</italic> were purchased from Ridgeway Research (UK).
