    "In our ongoing search for new bioactive fungal metabolites, four previously undescribed oxazole carboxylic acid derivatives (<b>1</b>-<b>4</b>) for which we proposed the trivial names macrooxazoles A-D together with two known tetramic acids (<b>5</b>-<b>6</b>) were isolated from the plant pathogenic fungus <i>Phoma macrostoma</i>. Their structures were elucidated based on high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The hitherto unclear structure of macrocidin Z (<b>6</b>) was also confirmed by its first total synthesis. The isolated compounds were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities against a panel of bacteria and fungi. Cytotoxic and anti-biofilm activities of the isolates are also reported herein. The new compound <b>3</b> exhibited weak-to-moderate antimicrobial activity as well as the known macrocidins <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>. Only the mixture of compounds <b>2</b> and <b>4</b> (ratio 1:2) showed weak cytotoxic activity against the tested cancer cell lines with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 23 µg/mL. Moreover, the new compounds <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, as well as the known compounds <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>, interfered with the biofilm formation of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, inhibiting 65%, 75%, 79%, and 76% of biofilm at 250 µg/mL, respectively. Compounds <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> also exhibited moderate activity against <i>S. aureus</i> preformed biofilm with the highest inhibition percentage of 75% and 73% at 250 µg/mL, respectively."
