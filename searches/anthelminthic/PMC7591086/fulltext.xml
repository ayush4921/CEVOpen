The most prevalent STH is <italic>Ascaris lumbricoides</italic>. Through large-scale deworming programs, World Health Organization aims to reduce morbidity, caused by moderate-to-heavy intensity infections, below 2%. In order to monitor these control programs, stool samples are examined microscopically for the presence of worm eggs. This procedure requires well-trained personnel and is known to show variability between different operators interpreting the slides. We have investigated whether ABA-1, one of the excretory-secretory products of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>lumbricoides</italic> can be used as a coproantigen marker for infection with this parasite. Polyclonal antibodies were generated and a coproantigen ELISA was developed. Using this ELISA, it was found that ABA-1 in stool detected <italic>Ascaris</italic> infection with a sensitivity of 91.5% and a specificity of 95.3%. Our results also demonstrate that there is a correlation between ABA-1 levels in stool and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>lumbricoides</italic> DNA detected in stool. Using a threshold of 18.2 ng/g stool the ABA-1 ELISA correctly assigned 68.4% of infected individuals to the moderate-to-heavy intensity infection group, with a specificity of 97.1%. Furthermore, the levels of ABA-1 in stool were shown to rapidly and strongly decrease upon administration of a standard anthelminthic treatment (single oral dose of 400 mg albendazole). In an <italic>Ascaris suum</italic> infection model in pigs, it was found that ABA-1 remained undetectable until day 28 and was detected at day 42 or 56, concurrent with the appearance of worm eggs in the stool. This report demonstrates that ABA-1 can be considered an <italic>Ascaris</italic> -specific coproantigen marker that can be used to monitor infection intensity. It also opens the path for development of point-of-care immunoassay-based tests to determine <italic>A</italic>. <italic>lumbricoides</italic> infection in stool at the sample collection site.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Intestinal worms are one of the most common infections in tropical and subtropical parts of the world. The roundworm <italic>Ascaris lumbricoides</italic> is the most prevalent and efforts are ongoing to use preventive chemotherapy to reduce both prevalence and intensity of this infection.

We have investigated the possibility of using ABA-1, an abundantly secreted protein from the worm, as a biomarker in stool of infected individuals.

This group of parasites comprises the intestinal worms <italic>Ascaris lumbricoides</italic>, <italic>Trichuris trichiura</italic>, and the hookworm species <italic>Ancylostoma duodenale</italic> and <italic>Necator americanus</italic>. They pose a major threat to public health in large parts of the world. Children and women of childbearing age are at highest risk of developing morbidity, which is mainly associated with moderate-to-heavy intensity (M&#x00026;HI) infections [<xref rid="pntd.0008807.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is therefore the goal of the WHO to reduce the prevalence of preschool and school-aged children with STH infections of M&#x00026;HI below 2% by 2030 [<xref rid="pntd.0008807.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. To reach this goal, so-called preventive chemotherapy (PC) programs have been implemented in which anthelminthic drugs (e.g. mebendazole or albendazole) are administered to school-aged children, regardless of their infection status [<xref rid="pntd.0008807.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Global control efforts for soil-transmitted helminthiasis are an essential part of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) put forward by the WHO where it contributes to achieve goal # 3: good health and well-being.</p><p>Monitoring of the current programs and decision-taking is currently based on the detection and quantification of STH eggs in a stool smear using a compound microscope, the so called Kato-Katz thick smear technique [<xref rid="pntd.0008807.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0008807.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This procedure however lacks standardization, is time-consuming and requires trained personnel and specific laboratory infrastructure. New diagnostic tools are therefore highly desired. Target Product Profiles (TPPs) describing the specific requirements for such new diagnostic approaches required for different use-cases were published and the identification of so-called coproantigens (i.e. antigen biomarkers present in stool) will enable the development of novel diagnostic tools to assess progress against program goals (use-case 2) [<xref rid="pntd.0008807.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>In the veterinary world, the use of coproantigen detection to diagnose helminth infection has become widely adopted [<xref rid="pntd.0008807.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0008807.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Diagnosis of human helminth infections based on coproantigen detection has also been investigated for e.g. <italic>Fasciola</italic> species, <italic>Strongyloides stercoralis</italic> and <italic>Taenia solium</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0008807.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0008807.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. To our knowledge, assays to detect roundworm coproantigens have been limited to <italic>Toxocara</italic> species and no specific proteins have been identified that are used as coproantigen for <italic>Ascaris</italic> species, such as <italic>A</italic>. <italic>suum</italic> in pigs and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>lumbricoides</italic> in humans [<xref rid="pntd.0008807.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008807.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>A few studies have explored the excretory-secretory products from different stages of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>suum</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0008807.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0008807.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These analyses were however based on isolated worms or larvae and to our knowledge no reports have described whether the identified proteins were readily detectable in feces of individuals with active infections. We have therefore investigated whether ABA-1, a protein that is known to be released by adult <italic>Ascaris</italic> worms and some larval stages, could be detected in fecal samples using a coproantigen ELISA [<xref rid="pntd.0008807.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

The ABA-1 ELISA had a LLOQ of 2.74 ng/g stool. Evaluation of this test on a panel of stool samples from school-aged children in Kenya with known parasitological status demonstrated a 95.3% specificity and a 91.5% sensitivity for <italic>A</italic>. <italic>lumbricoides</italic> detection. The assay that was developed not only resulted in a qualitative assessment of infection but was also shown to quantitatively reflect infection intensity. As such, a cut-off of 18.2 ng ABA-1/g stool in this experimental set-up was determined to correspond to the boundary between low and moderate infection intensity. This cut-off is of particular interest as <italic>Ascaris</italic>-related morbidity is predominantly associated to M&#x00026;HI infections [<xref rid="pntd.0008807.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This is also why the WHO has set the goal to reduce the prevalence of preschool and school-aged children with STH infections of M&#x00026;HI below 2% by 2030 [<xref rid="pntd.0008807.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Using this cut-off, 68.4% of the subjects with M&#x00026;HI infection, as determined by qPCR, were correctly identified. Although this might seem suboptimal, it is important to emphasize that in the current study the number of M&#x00026;HI infection was only 19, with most of them being just above the threshold for moderate infection. Also, it is known that there is significant variability in egg counts between different aliquots from the same stool sample [<xref rid="pntd.0008807.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Hence, there might also be significant variation in ABA-1 levels. Besides this cross-sectional analysis, a longitudinal analysis was performed on samples collected from <italic>A</italic>. <italic>lumbricoides</italic> infected subjects that were treated with albendazole. This treatment typically results in high cure rates, with in most cases no more eggs detected within 7 to 10 days after treatment, something that was observed in the current study as well [<xref rid="pntd.0008807.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0008807.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Similarly, ABA-1 levels also dropped strongly after treatment, with only 13.6% and 9.1% having ABA-1 levels above the LLOQ at 12 days and 24 days post-treatment, respectively. The very low ABA-1 levels observed after 24 days in some subjects may be attributed to worms which survived treatment, but with reduced or cessated egg production (drug-induced embryostasis), a phenomenon already demonstrated for <italic>Onchocerca volvulus</italic> and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>suum</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0008807.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008807.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Alternatively, this could also be caused by some remaining ABA-1 in the gut or possibly even from a new worm infection.</p><p>Additional demonstration of the role of ABA-1 as biomarker for <italic>Ascaris</italic> infection was achieved by assessing ABA-1 levels in pigs that were subjected to trickle infection with <italic>A</italic>. <italic>suum</italic>, which is often used as a model to study the host-parasite relationship. Since in the ABA-1 region that was used for the generation of the polyclonal antibodies there is only one amino acid difference between <italic>A</italic>. <italic>suum</italic> and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>lumbricoides</italic> (99.6% identity), it was expected that the antibodies would cross-react with <italic>A</italic>. <italic>suum</italic> ABA-1. It was found that at day 42 of the infection, the first pigs started to shed eggs in their stool and similarly, the first ABA-1 positive stool samples were detected at day 42. Two weeks later, already 50% of the pigs were ABA-1 positive, while 60% were positive by Mini-FLOTAC, indicating that ABA-1 appearance is closely related to the appearance of eggs in stool. This latter observation, together with the observation that bead beating was required to release ABA-1 from stool for ELISA testing, might support the hypothesis that ABA-1 in stool is mainly associated with parasite eggs or egg fragments. The concurrent appearance of ABA-1 and eggs in stool of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>suum</italic> infected pigs is different to what was observed with the <italic>Trichuris vulpis</italic> porin coproantigen assay where coproantigen was detected as early as 23 days post-infection while eggs were not observed before day 69 [<xref rid="pntd.0008807.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It can&#x02019;t be excluded that the current ABA-1 ELISA lacks sensitivity and that a more sensitive assay might be needed for detection of prepatent infection. In order to further investigate whether ABA-1 is associated to eggs, it could be of interest to study both male and female worm extracts, or to investigate the presence of ABA-1 in stool from individuals that were found to be infected only with male worms (as shown upon expulsion of the worms).</p><p>The biggest advantage of a coproantigen test could be its use at the collection site. When school-based deworming programs are being executed, the teams on the ground could use such a test to immediately assess the prevalence and intensity of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>lumbricoides</italic> infection in that community. Integration of school-based surveillance for STH in the deworming programs or other NTD surveillance programs, might be a very cost-effective approach [<xref rid="pntd.0008807.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008807.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Target product profiles for such use-case however describe increased reliability in lower transmission settings compared to microscopy [<xref rid="pntd.0008807.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It will require further evaluation to determine whether the coproantigen ELISA described here meets this criterium. The current protocol of the ABA-1 coproantigen test is based on the release of ABA-1 in the fecal samples using bead beating, followed by ELISA to determine the presence and amount of ABA-1 in the extract. Although the bead beating step appears to be essential, it might be of interest to further investigate how this procedure could be simplified and possibly performed in the field. Some simpler technologies to replace the bead beating step are available and could be explored [<xref rid="pntd.0008807.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008807.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. To release the ABA-1 from stool, we might use strong chaotropic reagents, such as guanidium hydrochloride, which has been shown to be effective in lysing <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> and even plant cell walls [<xref rid="pntd.0008807.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008807.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The fact that ABA-1 is a lipid-binding protein might suggest that certain detergents might enable the release of ABA-1 from the fecal samples without the need of bead beating [<xref rid="pntd.0008807.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The second step in the protocol, the ELISA based detection could easily be adapted to a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA). Similar LFIA&#x02019;s have been developed for detection of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> antigens in sputum samples, for the circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) in urine as diagnostic test for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic>, and many more [<xref rid="pntd.0008807.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0008807.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Also, the antibodies used in the ELISA described here are polyclonal antibodies. The development of monoclonal antibodies might result in an assay with even higher sensitivity and specificity. The current data show that a coproantigen test is a viable option for detection of helminth infection in man. Although we have shown that ABA-1 is a good coproantigen candidate for <italic>A</italic>. <italic>lumbricoides</italic>, there might also be other proteins with an even better sensitivity/specificity profile.</p><p>In conclusion, we developed a new sensitive coproantigen ELISA that detects <italic>Ascaris</italic> ABA-1 in stool sample extracts. Using this ELISA, we demonstrated that ABA-1 in stool is a highly sensitive and specific biomarker to detect infection with <italic>A</italic>. <italic>lumbricoides</italic> with ABA-1 levels correlating to infection intensity. A user-friendly and field-adjusted method of this assay could thus potentially be useful in monitoring infection prevalence and intensities in communities during STH control programs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0008807.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Correlation between <italic>A</italic>. <italic>lumbricoides</italic> FECs (expressed in epg) and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>lumbricoides</italic> DNA detection in stool collected in Kenya (expressed in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>lumbricoides</italic> copies/reaction) was used to determine a cut-off of 700 copies/reaction that could be used to identify subjects with moderate-to-high infection.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0008807.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0008807.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>SDS-PAGE (14%) analysis of recombinantly produced and purified His-tagged ABA-1.</title><p>A total of 2.2 &#x003bc;g of purified protein was loaded and visualized by Coomassie blue staining.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0008807.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0008807.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Effect of treatment with albendazole on the presence of <italic>Ascaris lumbricoides</italic> DNA in stool.</title><p>Stool samples were collected before (Day 0) and at different timepoints after treatment with albendazole: 6 days, 12 days and 24 days after treatment.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0008807.s003.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0008807.s004"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Performance characteristics of the ABA-1 coproantigen ELISA were determined by analyzing 7 calibration samples (Cal 1&#x02013;7) with known concentrations of ABA-1 recombinant protein.</title><p>Calibration curves were analyzed in 4-fold over 3 different days and back-calculated concentrations were used to determine accuracy and coefficients of variation.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0008807.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0008807.s005"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>BLAST analysis of ABA-1 performed on Wormbase Parasite using the entire <italic>T</italic>. <italic>trichiura</italic> proteome (prjeb535) as database.</title><p>(TXT)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0008807.s005.txt"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors like to thank Janssen Biobank for logistic support, Will Colon for critically reviewing the manuscript and Benny Baeten and Marc Engelen from Janssen Global Public Health for programmatic support.
