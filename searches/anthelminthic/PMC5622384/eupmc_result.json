    "<b>Background:</b> The challenge in antimicrobial chemotherapy is to find safe and selective agents with potency that will not be compromised by previously developed resistance. Terrestrial plants could provide new leads to antibacterial, antifungal, or antiprotozoal activity. <b>Methods:</b> The essential oil (EO) of <i>Piper aduncum</i> L. (Piperaceae) from Cuba was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A cluster analysis of <i>P. aduncum</i> EO compositions reported in the literature was carried out. The EO was screened against a panel of microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, parasitic protozoa) as well as for cytotoxicity against human cells. In addition, a review of scientific literature and a bibliometric study was also conducted. <b>Results:</b> A total of 90 compounds were identified in the EO, of which camphor (17.1%), viridiflorol (14.5%), and piperitone (23.7%) were the main components. The cluster analysis revealed at least nine different chemotypes. The EO did not show notable activity against bacteria or fungi, but was active against parasitic protozoa. <b>Conclusions:</b> The results from this study indicate <i>P. aduncum</i> from Cuba is a unique chemotype, support the importance of <i>P. aduncum</i> EOs as medicines, and demonstrate the promise of Cuban <i>P. aduncum</i> EO as a chemotherapeutic agent against parasitic protozoal infections."
