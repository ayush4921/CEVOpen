Since control is threatened by the appearance of drug resistant nematodes, there is a need to develop novel compounds, among which phytochemicals constitute potential anthelmintic agents. <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> has been pivotal in anthelmintic drug discovery and in revealing mechanisms of drug action and resistance. By using <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, we here revealed the anthelmintic actions of three plant terpenoids -thymol, carvacrol and eugenol- at the behavioral level. Terpenoids produce a rapid paralysis of worms with a potency rank order carvacrol &#x0003e; thymol &#x0003e; eugenol. In addition to their paralyzing activity, they also inhibit egg hatching, which would, in turn, lead to a broader anthelmintic spectrum of activity. To identify drug targets, we performed an <italic>in vivo</italic> screening of selected strains carrying mutations in receptors involved in worm locomotion for determining resistance to the paralyzing effect of terpenoids. The assays revealed that two Cys-loop receptors with key roles in worm locomotion -Levamisole sensitive nicotinic receptor (L-AChR) and GABA(A) (UNC-49) receptor- are involved in the paralyzing effects of terpenoids. To decipher the mechanism by which terpenoids affect these receptors, we performed electrophysiological studies using a primary culture of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> L1 muscle cells. Whole cell recordings from L1 cells demonstrated that terpenoids decrease macroscopic responses of L-AChR and UNC-49 receptor to their endogenous agonists, thus acting as inhibitors. Single-channel recordings from L-AChR revealed that terpenoids decrease the frequency of opening events, probably by acting as negative allosteric modulators. The fact that terpenoids act at different receptors may have important advantages regarding efficacy and development of resistance. Thus, our findings give support to the use of terpenoids as either an alternative or a complementary anthelmintic strategy to overcome the ever-increasing resistance of parasites to classical anthelmintic drugs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Parasitic nematodes (roundworms) are of major significance as human pathogens and have important economic impact worldwide due to considerable losses in livestock and food crops. Drug treatment of nematode infections (anthelmintic drugs) are the pillar of worm control in human and veterinary medicine. Due to the appearance of drug resistant nematodes, there is a need of developing novel drugs, among which phytochemicals, that have environmental sustainability advantages, may constitute potential anthelmintic compounds. As parasitic nematodes are not ideal laboratory animals, the free-living nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, which shares many physiological characteristics with parasites and is sensitive to anthelmintic drugs, has emerged as a model organism for anthelmintic drug discovery.

By testing mutant worms that lack receptor proteins essential for locomotion we identified two different muscle receptors, nicotinic and GABA receptors, as terpenoid targets of the paralyzing effects. Electrophysiological studies from <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> cultured muscle cells demonstrated that terpenoids inhibit the function of these receptors. Thus, by modulating two receptors with key roles in worm motility, these terpenoids emerge as novel anthelmintic compounds.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006668</institution-id><institution>Fondo para la Investigaci&#x000f3;n Cient&#x000ed;fica y Tecnol&#x000f3;gica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PICT 2015 0941</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0388-6129</contrib-id><name><surname>Bouzat</surname><given-names>Cecilia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005740</institution-id><institution>Universidad Nacional del Sur</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PGI 24/B227</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0388-6129</contrib-id><name><surname>Bouzat</surname><given-names>Cecilia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OPP1098404</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0388-6129</contrib-id><name><surname>Bouzat</surname><given-names>Cecilia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>CB was supported by the National Agency for the Promotion of Science and Technology- Argentina (grant number PICT 2015-0941; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.argentina.gob.ar/ciencia/agencia">https://www.argentina.gob.ar/ciencia/agencia</ext-link>), Universidad Nacional del Sur.

Humans themselves are host to different roundworm species, some of which are causative agents in core neglected tropical diseases, such as trichuriasis, ascariasis, hookworm disease, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, and dracunculiasis [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] These human diseases affect billions of people [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Also, gastrointestinal nematodes, such as <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic> and <italic>Ascaris suum</italic>, are one of the main causes of losses in animal productivity worldwide.</p><p>Anthelmintic drugs against these parasites act through different mechanisms, and ion channels are one of the main drug targets [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In particular, Cys-loop receptors, which are pentameric-ligand gated ion channels, are targets of widely used anthelmintics, such as levamisole, piperazine and ivermectin. Resistance of nematodes to the limited number of anthelmintic drugs available has become a global concern for veterinary and human health. There is therefore an urgent need for concerted efforts to develop novel anthelmintic agents.</p><p>The free-living nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is a valuable tool for the study of anthelmintic targets because it shares physiological and pharmacological characteristics with parasitic nematodes, it is sensitive to most anthelmintic drugs and it is a useful model organism for drug testing [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The muscle levamisole-sensitive acetylcholine receptor (L-AChR) and the &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A (UNC-49) receptor are Cys-loop receptors involved in muscle contraction and locomotion of parasitic nematodes and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>. They are also of clinical relevance as targets of anthelmintic drugs. In this regard, levamisole, which is a full agonist of nematode L-AChRs, produces spastic muscle paralysis and death, and piperazine, which is a GABA receptor agonist, causes flaccid and reversible paralysis of nematode body wall muscle.</p><p>Medicinal plants provide an alternative source of potential anthelmintic compounds [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Monocyclic phenolic compounds, such as thymol, carvacrol and eugenol, are a group of phytochemicals present in essential oils from aromatic plants including thyme (<italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic>), oregano (<italic>Origanum vulgare</italic>) and clove (<italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic>). These terpenoid phenols have been traditionally recognized for their antinociceptive, local anesthetic, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial actions [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. There are several reports showing the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of terpenoids on parasitic nematodes and their potential as anthelmintic compounds. In the early 1900s, thymol was used for the treatment of ascarids and hookworms in humans [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic>, it was shown that thymol and carvacrol have nematocidal activity against <italic>A</italic>. <italic>suum</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and that thymol inhibits the motility [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and egg hatching [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>contortus</italic>. Studies in pigs infected with <italic>A</italic>. <italic>suum</italic> showed that plant-based essential oil blends containing thymol and provided in food reduced infection burdens of helminths, thus showing promise as a daily supplement to reduce infections [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Nevertheless, the underlying molecular mechanisms of these anthelmintic actions have not been fully elucidated.</p><p>We here used <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> as a model for parasitic nematodes to explore the actions of three terpenoids with anthelmintic activity&#x02013;thymol, carvacrol and eugenol&#x02013;and to elucidate the mechanisms and targets by which they induce rapid paralysis. We found that they also inhibit egg hatching, thus mediating both rapid and long-term effects. Our behavioral assays in mutant <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> strains revealed that L-AChRs and UNC-49 (GABA) receptors are main targets involved in the terpenoid effects. Electrophysiological studies from <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> L1 muscle cells were performed to further identify the underlying mechanism. The results suggest that terpenoids inhibit responses to the neurotransmitters by acting as negative allosteric modulators. Thus, by interacting with two types of Cys-loop receptors with antagonic actions at the worm neuromuscular junction, these terpenoids emerge as promising anthelmintic compounds.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title><italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> strains</title><p>Nematode strains used were: N2: Bristol wild-type; PD4251: <italic>ccIs4251;dpy-20(e1282)</italic>; CB904: <italic>unc-38(e264)</italic>; CB407: <italic>unc-49(e407)</italic>; DA1316: <italic>avr-14(ad1305);avr-15(vu227);glc-1(pk54);</italic> RB918: <italic>acr-16(ok789)</italic>; DA1814: <italic>ser-1(ok345);</italic> MT9668: <italic>mod-1(ok103);</italic> AQ866: <italic>ser-4(ok512)</italic>.

Open- and closed-time histograms were plotted using a logarithmic abscissa and a square root ordinate and fitted to the sum of exponential functions by maximum likelihood using TACFit (Bruxton Corporation). To recognize bursts and quantify their durations, a critical closed time (t<sub>crit</sub>) was defined as the point of intersection between the briefest and the succeeding component, and openings separated by closings briefer than this time constitute a burst [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

Interestingly, at 10 &#x003bc;M ACh the decrease in the frequency of openings due to the presence of 50 &#x003bc;M thymol was not statistically significantly different to that measured at 100 &#x003bc;M ACh (42 &#x000b1; 24% at 10 &#x003bc;M ACh, n = 7, and 19 &#x000b1; 9% at 100 &#x003bc;M, n = 5, p&#x0003e;0.3). This finding suggests that thymol is not acting as a competitive antagonist.</p><p>Overall, in the presence of three different terpenoids -thymol, carvacrol and eugenol- single-channel activity of L-AChRs is significantly reduced, indicating an inhibitory effect. The results are compatible with action of these drugs as allosteric inhibitors.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Discussion</title><p>Anthelmintic treatment of nematode infections remains the pillar of worm control in both human and veterinary medicine. However, control is threatened by the appearance of drug resistant nematodes, which leads to the need of developing novel compounds.</p><p><italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> has been pivotal in anthelmintic drug discovery, in defining mechanisms of action of antiparasitic drugs, and in the understanding of mechanisms of drug resistance [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. By using <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, we here defined the anthelmintic actions of three plant terpenoids at the behavioral level, identified muscle L-AChR and GABA receptors as important targets involved in the paralyzing effects, and described the underlying molecular mechanisms. N-AChRs may also participate in terpenoid actions since the mutant worms lacking ACR-16 are more resistant than wild-type worms but this occurs only at low terpenoid concentrations. Interestingly, <italic>Ancylostoma caninum</italic> ACR-16 has been recently proposed as a valid target site for the development of anthelmintics against hookworm infections [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Considering previous <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies on parasitic nematodes reporting the efficacy of these terpenoids as antiparasitic drugs [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], our results are of high relevance for their application in anthelminthic therapies.</p><p>We found that terpenoids induce <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> paralysis as a function of time and concentration. The rank order of potencies established from the EC50 values for the paralyzing effects are carvacrol &#x0003e; thymol &#x0003e; eugenol, in accordance with previous reports in <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We showed that terpenoids produce &#x0201c;isometric&#x0201d; paralysis, in which worm body length does not change significantly during exposure on agar plates, as evaluated by visual inspection and measurement of worm length. On the contrary, the paralysis produced by agonists of L-AChRs, such as levamisole, or agonists of UNC-49 receptors, such as piperazine, is spastic or flaccid, respectively [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The type of phenotypic changes induced by terpenoids may be due to their dual effects on muscle receptors that mediate antagonistic actions since L-AChRs are involved in muscle contraction and UNC-49 receptors, in muscle relaxation. It is important to note that, although we can ensure that L-AChRs and UNC-49 receptors are markedly involved in the terpenoid paralyzing effects and that N-AChRs may also participate, additional targets -not here explored- could not be discarded. In fact, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> contains 29 nAChR subunits, which would be worthy of further study to explore terpenoid selectivity in the nicotinic family. Moreover, terpenoids act at receptors of different families, such as transient receptor potential channels [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] that are also present in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>Studies on <italic>Ascaris suum</italic> showed that carvacrol inhibits ACh-induced muscle contraction and membrane depolarization [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This is in full agreement with our results that demonstrate allosteric inhibition of L-AChR responses to ACh and, therefore, validate <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> as a nematode model for deciphering terpenoid action.</p><p>We determined that the sensitivity to terpenoids varies among developmental stages and L1 worms are more sensitive than adult worms. These findings are relevant due to importance of larvae in nematode transmission infections. One possible explanation for the different sensitivity could be due to differences in cuticle permeability between L1 and adult worms [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>The ability to reliably detect anthelmintic resistance is a crucial aspect of resistance management [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In this regard, the egg hatch assay has been used as a measurement of drug resistance [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In addition to the rapid paralyzing effects mediated by L-AChR and UNC-49 receptors at the neuromuscular junctions, we found that thymol, carvacrol and eugenol increase the fraction of unhatched eggs. This effect would, in turn, lead to a broader anthelmintic spectrum activity. The mode of action by which terpenoids produce egg-hatching inhibition has not been determined yet. Nevertheless, our findings indicate that by two temporarily different mechanisms -rapid paralysis and reduced egg-hatching- terpenoids may have a profound anthelmintic activity. Importantly, similar findings have been reported in the parasitic nematode <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic> exposed to plant essential oils, which showed ovicidal, larvicide and adulticide effects [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>The combinatorial chemotherapy strategy has been successful in achieving improved efficacy, decreased toxicity, and reduced development of drug resistance for several pathologies, including parasitosis [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The use of bioactive natural products as complementary tools to existing synthetic anthelmintic drugs has shown promising results [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. We showed that combinations of thymol-classic anthelmintics should be carefully evaluated since nematode susceptibility could be changed with respect to that of individual drug effects. At the tested concentrations, thymol-levamisole combinations were more effective to paralyze worms than thymol alone but the combinations thymol-piperazine and thymol-ivermectin were less effective. We determined by the Chou-Talalay&#x02019;s CI theorem included in Compusyn software that the combination effect is synergic (CI&#x0003c;1) for thymol-levamisole, at least at the tested concentrations. This is a widely used quantitative method that allows determination of synergism, antagonism or additive <italic>in vitro</italic>, in animals and in clinical trials [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>We performed electrophysiological recordings on <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> L1 muscle cells for defining drug action. We measured in the whole-cell configuration responses of L-AChRs and UNC-49 receptors to the terpenoids as well as to their endogenous agonists before and after terpenoid application. Unfortunately, and as reported previously, these cultured muscle cells are not technically suitable for successive drug applications, and we were therefore not able to obtain a complete pharmacological characterization [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition, terpenoids produce instability of membrane patches and high concentrations could not be tested. Nevertheless, we revealed that terpenoids do not activate the receptors and that peak currents elicited by ACh and GABA are reduced by thymol, carvacrol and eugenol, indicating that terpenoids act as inhibitors of both L-AChRs and UNC-49 receptors from <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>.</p><p>To further decipher the underlying mechanism of the macroscopic inhibitory effect, we recorded single-channel currents activated by ACh and levamisole that we have previously shown that correspond to the L-AChR [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The analysis revealed changes in the activity pattern without changes in amplitude and mean open and burst durations. The main change is evidenced as a marked reduction in the frequency of single L-AChR channel opening, which explains the mechanistic basis of the inhibitory effect. This effect could be due to terpenoid actions as competitive antagonists or negative allosteric inhibitors of L-AChRs. However, since the decrease in the frequency of opening events is similar at a 10-fold change in ACh concentration (10 and 100 &#x003bc;M), the results suggest that terpenoids are allosteric, non-competitive, inhibitors. Molecular mechanisms underlying non-competitive inhibition may be increased desensitization of resting receptors, slow open-channel blockade or impaired opening; these mechanisms cannot be distinguished from our single-channel recordings.</p><p>Terpenoids have been shown to have different modulatory actions (positive and negative) at different Cys-loop receptors. For example, thymol is a positive allosteric modulator of the human GABA(A) receptor and of a homo-oligomeric GABA-activated RDL receptor from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> RDL receptor, substitution of a threonine at 6&#x000b4;position of M2 to methionine, which is found in the mite <italic>Varroa Destructor</italic> RDL receptor, converts thymol into a negative modulator [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Monoterpenoids, including thymol, carvacrol and eugenol, act as negative allosteric modulators of &#x003b1;7 nAChR [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Thymol and carvacrol display allosteric agonist activity on the human 5-HT<sub>3</sub>A receptor but not on the closely related mouse 5-HT<sub>3</sub>A receptor [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Thymol inhibits macroscopic currents of the glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluClRs) from <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> (SmGluCl-2) and <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic> (AVR-14B GluCl) [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The fact that in our assays the triple mutant strain resistant to ivermectin was sensitive to thymol may indicate that for the anthelmintic action either the enhancement of GluClR activity is more important than its inhibition or the effects through L-AChR and GABA receptors are dominant. Docking studies using an NMR structure of the human &#x003b1;7 nAChR transmembrane domain (PDB code 2MAW) [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] indicated that cyclic monoterpenes may interact with an allosteric site located in the transmembrane domain [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The authors suggested that the binding of monoterpenes to the closed conformation will prevent the M2 helix from adopting the orientation that is characteristic of the open channel. This interpretation agrees with our results showing reduced frequency of opening events. The action of thymol through a transmembrane domain is also in line with results from mutant RDL receptors and from ELIC-5HT<sub>3</sub>A chimera [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>The fact that terpenoids act at different nematode receptors has important advantages since diverse lines of evidence indicate that polypharmacological agents, which are those that act simultaneously at various protein targets, might show better profiles than selective ligands, regarding both efficacy and side effects [<xref rid="pntd.0007895.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In addition, by acting at different receptors, terpenoids may reduce the development of resistance since one type of receptor may overcome the decreased drug sensitivity associated to mutations in the other receptor.</p><p>Overall, our work indicates that the treatment with terpenoids may be explored as an alternative or complementary anthelmintic strategy, which may help to overcome the ever-increasing resistance of parasites to classical anthelmintic drugs, as well as a supplement to reduce infection burdens of soil transmitted helminths.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007895.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Deciphering the molecular targets mediating terpenoid effects by using mutant strains.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0007895.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007895.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Analysis of the paralyzing effects of thymol, levamisole and thymol/levamisole combinations.</title><p>The analysis was performed using CompuSyn Software.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0007895.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> Genetics Center and WormBase.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pntd.0007895.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Craig</surname><given-names>TM</given-names></name>. <article-title>Gastrointestinal Nematodes, Diagnosis and Control</article-title>. <source>Vet Clin North Am Food Anim Pract</source>. <year>2018</year>; <volume>34</volume>: <fpage>185</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>199</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.cvfa.2017.10.008</pub-id>
