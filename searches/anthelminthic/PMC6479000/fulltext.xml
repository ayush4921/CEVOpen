It is affected by what we eat, what medicines we take, and what infections we acquire. In turn, it affects the way we absorb nutrients and whether we have excessive intestinal inflammation. Intestinal worms may have an important impact on the composition of the gut microbiome. Without a complete understanding of the impact of mass deworming programs on the microbiome, it is impossible to accurately calculate the cost-effectiveness of such public health interventions and to guard against any possible deleterious side effects. Our research examines this question in a &#x0201c;real-world&#x0201d; setting, using a longitudinal cohort, in which individuals with and without worm infections are treated with deworming medication and followed up at both three weeks and three months posttreatment. We quantify the impact of roundworms and hookworms on gut microbial composition, suggesting that the impact is small, but that treatment of hookworm infection results in significant changes. This work points to the need for follow-up studies to further examine the impact of hookworm on the gut microbiota and determine the health consequences of the observed changes.</p></abstract><abstract><title>ABSTRACT</title><p>Murine studies suggest that the presence of some species of intestinal helminths is associated with changes in host microbiota composition and diversity. However, studies in humans have produced varied conclusions, and the impact appears to vary widely depending on the helminth species present. To demonstrate how molecular approaches to the human gut microbiome can provide insights into the complex interplay among disparate organisms, DNA was extracted from cryopreserved stools collected from residents of 5 rural Kenyan villages prior to and 3&#x02009;weeks and 3&#x02009;months following albendazole (ALB) therapy. Samples were analyzed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) for the presence of 8 species of intestinal parasites and by MiSeq 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Based on pretreatment results, the presence of neither <named-content content-type="genus-species">Ascaris lumbricoides</named-content> nor <named-content content-type="genus-species">Necator americanus</named-content> infection significantly altered the overall diversity of the microbiota in comparison with age-matched controls. Following ALB therapy and clearance of soil-transmitted helminths (STH), there were significant increases in the proportion of the microbiota made up by <italic>Clostridiales</italic> (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0002; average fold change, 0.57) and reductions in the proportion made up by <italic>Enterobacteriales</italic> (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0004; average fold change, &#x02212;0.58). There was a significant posttreatment decrease in Chao1 richness, even among individuals who were uninfected pretreatment, suggesting that antimicrobial effects must be considered in any posttreatment setting. Nevertheless, the helminth-associated changes in <italic>Clostridiales</italic> and <italic>Enterobacteriales</italic> suggest that clearance of STH, and of <italic>N. americanus</italic> in particular, alters the gut microbiota.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>16S RNA</kwd><kwd>epidemiology</kwd><kwd>helminths</kwd><kwd>hookworm</kwd><kwd>microbial communities</kwd><kwd>microbial ecology</kwd><kwd>microbiota</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>London Centre for Neglected Tropical Disease Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>Roy M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIAID Microbiome Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Belkaid</surname><given-names>Yasmine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (DIR, NIAID)</institution><institution-id>https://doi.org/10.13039/100006492</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nutman</surname><given-names>Thomas B.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><counts><count count="4" count-type="supplementary-material"/><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="55"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="9438"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>March/April 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Helminths and humans have coevolved for millennia. Some helminths are known to have far-reaching effects on the human immune system (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), and it is possible that some of these effects are mediated by changes in the gut microbiota (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Changes in intestinal bacterial communities have been associated with both inflammatory diseases (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and some helminth infections (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), all of which may interact (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Studies in animal models and veterinary species provide evidence that the presence of intestinal helminths in the host can be associated with alterations in microbial communities, though the changes seen are not consistent across species of hosts and parasites (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Changes in <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> and <italic>Firmicutes</italic> (the two most common phyla in the human gut [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]) are frequently discussed in this body of literature. Changes (or lack thereof) in diversity vary by helminth species, but in general, the presence of helminth infections has been linked with increases in microbial diversity (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>Some studies comparing humans with and without helminth infections have found differences in microbiota diversity and composition. One research consortium found that alpha diversity did not vary between comparison groups, but that beta diversity was higher among soil-transmitted helminths (STH)-infected individuals in Sri Lanka than in uninfected individuals (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). This group found that individuals in Italy who were infected with <named-content content-type="genus-species">Strongyloides stercoralis</named-content> had microbiota with higher alpha diversity and lower beta diversity than uninfected peers (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Individuals in two Malaysian villages infected with <named-content content-type="genus-species">Trichuris trichiura</named-content> were found to have greater species richness and more <italic>Paraprevotellaceae</italic> than their uninfected neighbors (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). A study in a similar setting found that successful treatment of <italic>T. trichiura</italic> infections was followed by a reduction in <italic>Clostridiales</italic> and an increase in the levels of a proinflammatory <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bacteroides</named-content> species (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). A study in Indonesia and Liberia identified specific signatures in the microbiota that discriminated between individuals moderately/heavily infected with any STH and uninfected individuals (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Other studies of individuals with <named-content content-type="genus-species">Schistosoma haematobium</named-content> and <italic>T. trichiura</italic> did not find large differences in the microbiota of individuals with and without STH or before or after anthelmintic treatment (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Recently, a placebo-controlled anthelmintic trial in Indonesia found that neither albendazole (ALB) nor helminth infection affected microbiota composition in the overall study population, but that ALB treatment was associated with lower levels of <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> in a specific study population (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). These studies were based on naturally acquired infections (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>); experimental hookworm infections in humans were associated with an increase in microbial species richness but no significant change in microbial diversity or community structure (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, our aim was to utilize stool samples collected longitudinally from an area where <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic> and <italic>N. americanus</italic> are endemic to examine the relationship between these STH and the human gut microbiota. Individuals in the study were infected with neither <named-content content-type="genus-species">Trichuris trichiura</named-content> nor <named-content content-type="genus-species">Strongyloides stercoralis</named-content>. Our data demonstrate that there were no obvious significant associations between STH infection and microbial diversity or richness, but successful anthelmintic treatment of <italic>N. americanus</italic> was followed by changes in microbial composition. Specifically, we found that <italic>Clostridiales</italic> increased and <italic>Enterobacteriales</italic> decreased following clearance of <italic>N. americanus</italic> infection.

Sequencing coverage was sufficiently higher in batch B (30% of the samples had fewer than 10,000 reads in batch A compared with 1% in batch B) to justify focusing our paired analyses on batch B alone, despite larger sample sizes being available using data from batch A. Additionally, since changes 3&#x02009;months posttreatment could have been a result of helminth clearance, seasonal diet patterns, or some other time-dependent factor, samples were collected and sequenced from a subset (12 who had been infected with an STH pretreatment and 8 who had not) of participants 3&#x02009;weeks following ALB treatment. At 3 weeks posttreatment, these individuals tested negative for STH infection, but the season had not yet changed.

Clustering of similar microbiota within comparison groups was assessed using permutational analysis of variance. This analysis was based on unweighted UniFrac distances, though analysis based on Bray-Curtis distances is shown as well (<xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). This analysis found that there were no major differences in microbial communities of those with and without <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic> or <italic>N. americanus</italic> at baseline, nor were there changes following treatment in any comparison group. One of these comparisons is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>, where it can be seen that the pretreatment (red) samples and posttreatment (green) samples from the same people do not cluster separately. There appear to be two clusters in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>, but each cluster includes pre- and posttreatment samples, in accordance with the nonsignificant <italic>P</italic> value for separation of these two groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.268, shown in <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). Many pretreatment samples are similar to the posttreatment sample from the same person (such as 2016D) whereas others are not (such as 3095C). This analysis suggests that whatever differences may be found in the microbiota of STH-infected and uninfected people, they are not markedly different in their overall composition. The most highly significant difference between comparison groups based on the Bray-Curtis distances was between individuals who were uninfected with any STH at baseline and the same individuals 3&#x02009;weeks posttreatment (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001). Unweighted UniFrac distances do not consider the relative frequencies of taxa, which may explain why the differences seen in the representation of specific taxa do not translate into overall separation in terms of PCoA.</p><fig id="fig4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Principal-coordinate analysis (PCoA) of samples from individuals infected with <italic>N. americanus</italic> pretreatment, but uninfected 3&#x02009;months posttreatment.

However, there is still no clear consensus of the impact of STH on microbiota diversity and composition. This could be in part because of differences in the STH species, prevalence, and intensity of infection in these different locations, as well as differences in the laboratory and analytical methodologies employed (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). In the present study, we used samples collected in Kenya as part of a larger study to examine differences in the stool microbiota of individuals with and without STH infections and before and after deworming treatment. Unlike previous studies where <italic>T. trichiura</italic> was a major intestinal pathogen (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), the helminth infections in this population were primarily <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic> and <italic>N. americanus</italic>. Our data largely suggest that neither the presence of <italic>N. americanus</italic> nor <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic> infection was associated with marked dysbiosis. However, it is important to note that adult <italic>N. americanus</italic> and <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic> worms reside in the small intestine, whereas adult <named-content content-type="genus-species">Trichuris</named-content> spp. reside in the colon. It has been seen in animal models that the microbiota of the small intestine differs from that of the large intestine and feces (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), which means that any local impact of <italic>N. americanus</italic> and <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic> may be attenuated by subsequent changes that occur in the large intestine.</p><p>In contrast with published literature showing that helminths are associated with increased microbial diversity (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), people in the present study all had similar levels of microbial richness (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) and diversity (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), regardless of whether they were infected with <italic>N. americanus</italic> or <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref> and <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). Since STH are prevalent in the study setting and likely have been for generations, helminth infection may have already imposed changes on the gut microbiota of all individuals in this region. STH infection could have influenced the microbiota of currently uninfected individuals during past STH infections or through transfer of microbiota from an individual&#x02019;s mother (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) or close contacts who had helminth infections. Additionally, research from other groups on STH and microbial diversity has led to a mixture of results, including some where helminths are associated with decreased diversity (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) and several that found find no impact of STH on diversity (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). The clearance of helminth infections was not associated with changes in microbial diversity, except for a slight decrease in Chao1 index 3&#x02009;months posttreatment. It seems unlikely that this is a biologically meaningful trend, because if that were so, there would have to be a treatment effect decreasing microbial richness that was attenuated by past infection with helminths.</p><p>Similarly, the permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and associated PCoA did not find any striking differences between any of the comparison groups based on unweighted UniFrac distances (<xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). The studies in Ecuador, Indonesia, and Liberia all also found that there was no clear separation of samples from the STH-infected and uninfected comparison groups (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In contrast, the study in Malaysia found that samples from helminth-infected indigenous Malaysians clustered separately from those from urban study participants (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>There were, however, some significant differences seen in the differential abundances of certain taxa. The most striking differences seen in terms of microbial composition between comparison groups were between individuals with <italic>N. americanus</italic> at baseline and those same individuals at 3&#x02009;months posttreatment. In particular, the proportion of the microbiota made up by <italic>Clostridiales</italic> increased and that made up by <italic>Enterobacteriales</italic> decreased in these individuals following treatment. A recent study of STH following treatment with ALB in humans (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) found that <italic>Clostridiales</italic> was less abundant after treatment. A study in Indonesia (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) did not see any changes in <italic>Clostridiales</italic> or <italic>Enterobacteria</italic> and used the level of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> in each sample as a reference. A study in Indonesia and Liberia (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) identified taxa that discriminate between STH-infected and uninfected individuals. Seven out of the 12 taxa that were positively associated with infection were within <italic>Firmicutes</italic>, and 4 of these were from <italic>Clostridiales</italic>. In an analysis of the data originally collected in Ecuador (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), 7 taxa positively associated with STH were <italic>Firmicutes</italic>. The original study had concluded that infection with <italic>T. trichiura</italic> may have no effect on fecal microbiota but that <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic> might be associated with changes (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Several <italic>Ruminococcaceae</italic> strains were also more common posttreatment in <italic>N. americanus</italic>-infected individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.&#x000a0;5B</xref>). Similarly, <italic>Ruminococcaceae</italic> has been negatively associated with <named-content content-type="genus-species">Hymenolepis</named-content> spp. and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Syphacia</named-content> spp. infection in wild mice (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), <named-content content-type="genus-species">Trichuris suis</named-content> in pigs (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Trichostrongylus retortaeformis</named-content> in rabbits (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). <italic>Ruminococcaceae</italic> are highly cellulolytic, and thus, reduction during helminth infection could possibly reduce a host&#x02019;s ability to digest plant material.</p><p>Any microbial population affected acutely by STH infection might be expected to return to the uninfected state following clearance of the infection. In Malaysia, the <italic>Clostridiales</italic>/<italic>Bacteroidales</italic> ratio appeared to revert following successful treatment of <italic>T. trichiura</italic> infections (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In Indonesia and Liberia, however, posttreatment microbial communities were more similar to pretreatment microbial communities than those of uninfected individuals (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Since there were no pretreatment differences between STH-infected and uninfected individuals in the present study (nor in one study in Indonesia [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]), there was no possibility of the microbiota reverting to an uninfected state.</p><p>The known relationship between differential abundance of microbial taxa in the intestines and parasitic infections is more extensive when nonhuman hosts and non-STH parasites are considered. <italic>Firmicutes</italic> (phylum) and <italic>Clostridiales</italic> (order) have been positively associated with <named-content content-type="genus-species">Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri</named-content> (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Trichuris muris</named-content> (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) infections in mice.

These and other differences associated with helminth infections are summarized in references <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>.</p><p>One of the strengths of this study is that participants were examined at 2 time points posttreatment. The 3-week time point allowed us to look at the acute impact of ALB treatment on the microbiota, before seasonal changes in diet and environment could impact the microbiota of participants. The 3-month time point allowed us to examine the longer-term impact of helminth clearance. The uninfected comparison group, which was also evaluated pretreatment and 3&#x02009;months posttreatment, allowed us to identify changes that were likely due to seasonality or to ALB. The study in Indonesia (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) accomplished this by having a control group that was uninfected with STH and not treated with ALB. In our study, as in a study by Ramanan et al. (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), treatment was implemented as it would be in a mass deworming program, meaning that there was no untreated group. At our 3-weeks-posttreatment time point, there were no changes in diversity or by PCoA (except in individuals who were uninfected at baseline, according to Bray-Curtis distances). This result is not likely to be very meaningful, unless this is a change that was prevented by some kind of stabilizing effect of recent STH infection and thus not seen in STH-infected individuals posttreatment. There were no significant changes in the frequencies of particular microbial taxa at 3&#x02009;weeks posttreatment, except that <italic>Aeromonadales</italic> (<italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic>) was less common at the 3-week time point. This could mean that <italic>Aeromonadales</italic> are transiently reduced by ALB treatment. One study did not detect a direct ALB treatment effect on the gut microbiota (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), whereas another found differences in the gut microbiota between individuals given ALB versus a placebo, but only among individuals who remained helminth-infected posttreatment (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). A study of ALB treatment of pregnant women suggested a direct drug effect on the risk of allergy in infancy (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). In conjunction with prior work, our study suggests that the direct effects of ALB treatment should be considered in the design of future studies. They should also be further examined to determine whether changes mediated by ALB have any effect on a host&#x02019;s susceptibility to opportunistic pathogens. Potential direct drug effects on the microbiome, in combination with concern that frequent single-drug therapy could select for resistance (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) in helminths and future improvements in low-cost diagnostic techniques, may influence the debate over when mass deworming is preferable to test-and-treat strategies (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>).</p><p>This study contributes to the ongoing discussion over whether there are measurable impacts of STH infection on the human stool microbiota. In particular, we are able to identify changes in the microbiota associated with clearance of <italic>N. americanus</italic> infection, which are not seen posttreatment in individuals who were uninfected pretreatment. By sampling at two different time points posttreatment, we are able to identify some changes in microbial community structure that may be transient and possibly are the result of treatment with ALB or of worm expulsion, as well as other changes that are probably longer-term consequences of the microbiota readjusting to the lack of helminth presence. We welcome the purpose-built helminth/microbiota studies that are under way and believe that microbiota sequencing from samples collected as part of deworming program monitoring and evaluation studies will contribute to an improved understanding of which changes are consistent across geographies for each STH species. We also welcome efforts to standardize the methodology for comparing microbiota sequencing between groups and suggest that further research is needed to understand whether stool microbiota sequencing is sufficiently representative of the human gut microbiota in the small intestine (in which <italic>N. americanus</italic> and <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic> reside). This study contributes to our understanding of how microbial communities differ between STH-infected and uninfected individuals; the next step will be to understand the impact of the identified differences on human health.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4.1"><title>Sample collection and study design.</title><p>Stool samples were collected from 5 villages in rural western Kenya, as described elsewhere (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>).

During the delay between production in the morning, time in the field lab where parasitological examination and aliquoting took place, and transport to the hospital where they were stored, samples were kept in cool shady areas as much as possible. Baseline (pretreatment) stool collection occurred in January through March 2014. All study participants (both STH infected and uninfected) were subsequently treated under observation with 400&#x02009;mg ALB. Stool samples were collected again 3&#x02009;weeks following treatment from all STH-infected individuals and from a subset of STH-uninfected individuals. All posttreatment samples sequenced for this study were STH negative by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Three months following treatment, stool samples were collected from the entire study population again prior to everyone being treated again with ALB. Samples were shipped on dry ice to the NIH.

Methodological differences and batch effects limited our analysis to comparisons of individuals within the same batch. Technical limitations in batch A prevented the acquisition of a broad distribution of read coverage, and a majority of samples exhibited low read counts, necessitating rarefaction at a low depth. Furthermore, batch A was split across 3 different sequencing runs, and batch effects limited the number of possible comparisons. This spurred a single resequencing run, focusing on sequencing longitudinal samples within the same batch, which had improved breadth of coverage (batch B). For this paper, only data from batch B are used for longitudinal comparisons; however, pretreatment comparisons of microbial richness and diversity between individuals with and without STH infections are shown using both batch A and batch B data. In these comparisons, 23 individuals with and without <italic>N. americanus</italic> were compared, 29 individuals with and without <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic> were compared, and 48 individuals with and without any STH (evenly split between <italic>N. americanus</italic> and <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic>) were compared using these batch A data.

Unweighted UniFrac distances were chosen because they incorporate the relatedness of different taxa and are frequently used in microbial ecology. Bray-Curtis distances were also calculated and analyzed but were not the primary focus here.</p><p>Finally, we delved into specific differences in the abundances of different types of bacteria within the microbiota of individuals studied here. We performed Wilcoxon exact paired tests (in R) comparing the representation of operational taxonomic units (OTUs). This was done at different levels from phylum to genus. All phylogenetic levels were inspected separately in order to identify trends occurring at any level. The Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery rate calculation was used to correct for multiple comparisons. False-discovery rates of 1 and 5% were considered.
