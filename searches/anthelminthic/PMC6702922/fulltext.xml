For several years, <italic>Fasciola</italic> spp. has been known to cause serious diseases in livestock, wild-life, and pet animals [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Fasciolosis is caused by <italic>Fasciola hepatica</italic> (<italic>F. hepatica</italic>) and <italic>Fasciola gigantica</italic> (<italic>F. gigantica</italic>) commonly in temperate and tropical regions, respectively. <italic>Fasciola gigantica</italic> has been reported in Africa, Asia, and Hawaii [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. <italic>Fasciola hepatica</italic> can be found in more than 50 countries, in all continents of the world, except Antarctica. In general, fasciolosis is more common in animals than in humans. Nevertheless, the number of infected people in the world is thought to exceed two million [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>This disease was considered to be one of the major threats to livestock production because of its widespread distribution where significant losses may occur [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This can be accounted to the confiscated liver, low milk production, reproductive inefficiency, and low meat yield [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It adversely affects milk production, wool quality, and weight gain of the animal. The effective control of fasciolosis currently includes the strategic and tactile use of anthelmintic medications and proper grazing land management, stock density control, and or rotational grazing. Due to limited available anthelminthic, high veterinary cost, anthelmintic resistance, drug residues in milk and meat, toxicity problems, and not effective intermediate host control measures, the population is dependent on traditional remedies.</p><p>Treatment of fasciolosis is more of commercially-manufactured anthelmintic drugs [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], but infrequently with the use of herbal plants [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In the Philippines, the use herbal plants in treating diseases have become limited because of the spiraling cost and availability of anthelmintic drugs in the local market [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, there are some serious disadvantages in using chemical dewormers such as development of resistance to anthelmintic, residues and pollution, and long withdrawal period prior to slaughter [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Thus, this study aimed to measure the anthelmintic effects of betel nut (<italic>Areca catechu</italic>) and neem (<italic>Azadirachta indica</italic>) leaf extracts against <italic>Fasciola</italic> spp. <italic>in vitro</italic> in comparison with the commercial dewormer, Albendazole, and the negative control, nutrient broth. The study determined the extract concentration that produced the highest efficacy based on the average recorded mean motility time, gross, and microscopic changes of the flukes treated with different concentrations of plant extracts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materialsandmethods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Collection of samples</title><p>Live <italic>Fasciola</italic> spp. were collected directly from the liver of buffaloes bought from the slaughter house. The samples were transported to the laboratory for further processing. The liver was cut on the bile duct part where the flukes were found and collected using a non-traumatic thumb forceps. Right after collection, the flukes were immediately exposed to the different treatments. Only flukes with normal gross morphologic tegument and exhibit motility by visual inspection were selected. The flukes were weighed using a digital pocket weighing scale system.

The fresh fruits were halved and the nuts were separated from the shell using a knife and were scooped using a teaspoon then placed in a bottle container.

The powdered material of dried betel nut seeds weighing 500 gm was mixed with 1 l of 80% ethanol for 48 h to get the concentrated extracts.

The powdered material of dried mature neem leaves weighing 500 gm was mixed to 1 l of 80% ethanol for 48 h to get the concentrated extracts.

One liver was used for the first four treatments (T1&#x02013;T4) and another for the remaining treatments (T5&#x02013;T8) (<xref rid="table1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The flukes after collection on the liver using a non-traumatic thumb forceps were carefully and individually placed on the digital pocket weighing scale. The flukes that fit with the accepted weight range were kept in petri dishes containing the different plant extract concentrations. Each treatment contained five flukes.

In 10%, 20%, and 40% concentrations, BNE was found to be highly effective against <italic>Fasciola</italic> spp. with mean motility time average of 0.22, 0.07 min, and no movement upon exposure, respectively. The results showed that 10%, 20%, and 40% betel nut concentration had no significant difference with that of the Albendazole-treated group. All flukes were observed to have sudden paralysis then became immobile and suddenly stopped moving upon exposure to the BNE extract treatments. In addition, it was observed that a significant increase in efficiency of BNE as the concentration is increased based on the motility of the flukes. At 40% BNE extract concentration, the flukes became immobile and non-motile upon exposure. This treatment had the highest efficacy based on meat motility time. Statistical analyses showed no significant differences at 10%, 20%, and 40% BNE concentrations. In the study of Jeyathilakan et al.
