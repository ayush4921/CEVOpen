Parasitic infections impair animal health, welfare, and productivity since the presence of worms results in increased death rate and poor growth and reproduction (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). This chronic infection is in importance according to public health and veterinary issues in endemic areas such as Iran (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Even in non-endemic countries, the potential of new endemicity creation, by livestock importations and migration of infected patients, should be considered (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>At present, there are four main options for cyst treatment; surgery, drug therapy, PAIR (puncture, aspiration, injection, and reaspiration) and observation for inactive cysts; which one or two will be incorporated depending on cyst characteristics and physician&#x02019;s choice (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Surgery is the first suggested treating option due to potential of total removal of the cyst and obtaining a 100% cure. However, in the case of inoperable patients or for prevention of cyst recurrence and secondary infection as a result of protoscoleces leakage or even as injection solution after aspiration of cyst contents, incorporation of efficacious scolicidal agents seems to be necessary (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>The mainly used chemotherapeutics for metacestode stage of <italic>Echinococcus</italic> are benzimidazole carbamates, such as albendazole and mebendazole, in addition to praziquantel and amphotericin B. Unfortunately, a notable number of patients do not respond desirably to these drugs and the rate of relapse after treatment cessation is high. Moreover, adverse drug reactions have been reported because of chemotherapy including liver enzymes elevation, gastrointestinal discomforts, alopecia etc. by albendazole. Similarly, numerous chemical scolicidal solutions have been employed for inactivation of protoscoleces in PAIR and surgery including ethanol, hypertonic saline, silver nitrate, cetrimide, povidone-iodine, albendazole sulfoxide, octenidine hydrochloride and chlorhexidine gluconate; but the majority of them are along with hepatobiliary adverse reactions. Although there is no means by use of scolicidal agents, an ideal one that would be inexpensive, with rapid and complete scolicidal action and leaving minimum local and systemic side effects, has not been discovered yet (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>A recently developing field with an ancient historical foundation is the use of plant-derived compounds depending on their anthelmintic potentials, in order to discover the ideal scolicidal agent. Plant based medicine mostly favors the advantages of high availability, low cost and probably fewer side effects (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>Amongst the plants offering Anthelmintic properties, pumpkin seed (<italic>Cucurbita</italic> sp.) is prominent (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). <italic>C. moschata</italic> and <italic>C. maxima</italic> are the main species in Cucurbitaceae used as traditional vermifuge in Iran. Pumpkin is also suggested for treatment of malaria, cough producing chest pain, thirst-quenching and in the form of oil for earache and as gastrointestinal laxative and emollient in traditional Persian medicine (TPM) (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Due to the vast pumpkin&#x02019;s therapeutic indications in TPM and appropriate agricultural climate, Iran has been identified among the major pumpkin producing countries by The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAOSTAT) (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>Effectiveness of pumpkin seeds against taeniasis (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and schistosomiasis (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) which both are members of platyhelminths phylum, has been previously reported in ethnoveterinary literature and human studies. Moreover, the in vitro anthelmintic activity of pumpkin seed&#x02019;s extract on <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic> is confirmed (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Based on TPM and recent vermifugal observations of pumpkin seed, this study was designed to evaluate the anthelminthic activity of <italic>C. moschata</italic> spices, which is mainly agriculture and consumed in Iran, against protoscoleces of hydatid cyst. For coverage of a range of polar and nonpolar possible vermicide compounds, both hydro-alcoholic extract (HAE) and petroleum ether extract (PEE) of pumpkin seed was prepared and evaluated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Collection and extraction of plant</title><p>Pumpkin (<italic>C. moschata</italic>) fruits were bought from local people in northern part of Iran in Aug 2016. Pumpkin seeds were collected from the fruits with the primary weight of about 290 g after washing. Seeds were subjected to dry, in oven in 45 &#x000b0;C until their weight get fixed at 231.43 gr. Afterward, two extraction systems were conducted on 100 g of grounded seeds including hydro-alcoholic extraction for polar compounds and petroleum ether extraction for non-polar compounds.</p><p>First grounded seeds were loaded on filter paper and placed in a soxhlet extractor. Plant part was covered by 650 ml petroleum ether solvent and extraction was performed at 65 &#x000b0;C for 8 h (until the solvent appears colorless and clear in the upper part). Then the obtained extract was filtered and solvent amount was decreased to the possible minimum level, utilizing rotary evaporator with vacuum. Remaining plant residue was dried for hydro-alcoholic extraction.</p><p>Hydro-alcoholic extract was prepared by maceration method; dried seed powder was mixed with 300 ml hydro-alcoholic solvent (methanol 70: water 30) in an Erlenmeyer flask. Flask was covered with an aluminum foil and shaked overnight. The extract was filtered and kept at 4 &#x000b0;C. Maceration was repeated three times. Methanol part of total extract was evaporated by rotary evaporator. Remaining water part was subjected to freeze drier to make concentrated powder extract. All the extracts were stored in 4 &#x000b0;C in amber bottles.</p></sec><sec><title>Extract dilutions</title><p>Both PEE and HAE were serially diluted in distilled water to reach the concentrations of 200, 20, 2 and 0.2 mg/ml. Extracts would be double diluted while mixing with equal volume of protoscolex suspension and therefore present their possible vermicidal effect with final concentrations of 100, 10, 1 and 0.1 mg/ml. Due to hydrophobic nature of petroleum ether extract, tween 80 was used to form a homogenous emulsion with concentration of 10% V/V in extracts and control solutions.</p></sec><sec><title>Anti-helminthic evaluations</title><sec><title>Collection of protoscoleces</title><p><italic>E. granulosus</italic> protoscoleces were collected from sheep livers slaughtered at Rasht industrial abattoir. Hydatid fluid was aspirated from a cyst by a sterile 50 ml syringe and transferred into a falcon tube. Gentle centrifugation was applied on hydatid fluid with 1000 rpm for 1 min to settle down the protoscoleces with minimum time waste. Protoscoleces were washed with NaCl 0.9% solution and their number was adjusted to 2500 protoscoleces per ml with at least 90% primary viability. Viability was determined by impermeability to eosin dye (Sigma-aldrich) solution under light microscope (Carl-Zeiss Standard 14).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Effects of pumpkin seed extracts on protoscoleces</title><sec><title>Viability assessment</title><p>For evaluation and comparison of scolicidal activity of HAE and PEE of pumpkin seeds, four different concentrations (100, 10, 1, 0.1 mg/ml) were tested against protoscoleces in 5, 15, 30 and 60 min. Normal saline 0.9% solution was incorporated as control. First 500 &#x003bc;lit of protoscolex suspension was loaded in 1.5 ml micro-tubes, then 500 &#x003bc;lit of each concentration was added to micro-tubes. Tube contents were gently mixed and incubated in 37 &#x000b0;C for 15, 30 and 60 min. In each time point, 50 &#x003bc;lit of settled protoscoleces was mixed with 50 &#x003bc;lit of eosin dye 0.1% on a glass slide and covered with a cover glass. The slide was carefully studied under a light microscope and the percentage of dead protoscoleces was calculated after total counting of 300 protoscoleces. After exposure to protoscolex with eosin dye, dead organisms absorbed the dye and appeared with orange-red color. While live protoscoleces remained impermeable to eosin (colorless) and maintained their flame cell activity and muscular movements. The procedure was separately performed for hydro-alcoholic and petroleum ether extracts and the experiment was run in triplicate for each concentration and time interval.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>HPTLC Analysis of pumpkin seed extracts</title><p><bold>Solvent extractions</bold>. 0.1 g of extracts was subjected to serial extraction with four organic solvents, covering a wide range of polarity, starting from an absolutely non-polar solvent (hexane) followed by gradually increasing polarity solvents (ethyl acetate, chloroform, methanol).

Pumpkins, collected from Guadeloupe (French West Indies) (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) revealed similar constituents as pumpkins collected from northern Iran.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>However, the <italic>C. moschata</italic> extracts (especially hydroalcoholic) showed scolicidal activity, since highest mortality was 16% with concentration of 10 mg/ml of HAE in 60 min, the extract did not reach LD50 (50% mortality). Therefore, the potency of the total extract is not sufficient as potential scolicidal drug. Moreover, further studies on other solvents and extraction methods and phytochemical analysis in order to find the exact efficacious molecule can be impressive.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The financial support of this study was provided by Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, through grant no. 31778.
