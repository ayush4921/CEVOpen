    "<h4>Introduction</h4>The hematopoietic system is one of the systems which can be affected by malnutrition, leading to impaired production of all blood cell lines. Undernourished children with hematological abnormalities like anemia are at higher risk of mortality. Therefore, this study aimed at determining the magnitude and associated factors of hematological abnormalities among undernourished under-five children attending at the University of Gondar Specialized Referral Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia.<h4>Methods and materials</h4>An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted on a total of 251 undernourished under-five children at University of Gondar Specialized Referral Hospital from January to May 2020. A convenient sampling technique was employed to select study participants. Data were collected using a pretested structured questionnaire. Blood samples were collected for complete blood count which were determined by Sysmex KX-21N analyzer. Stool sample was processed via direct wet mount. Thin and thick blood films were examined to assess malaria parasite. The data were entered to EpiData version 4.6.0.0 and analyzed using SPSS version 23 software. Bi-variable and multi-variable binary logistic regression model were fitted to identify factors associated with hematological abnormalities. A p-value <0.05 in the multivariable analysis was considered as statistically significant.<h4>Results</h4>The overall magnitude of anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia was 53.4%, 26.7%, 23.9%, 8%, and 2.8%, respectively. Being male, age 6-23 months, high birth order, intestinal parasite infection, edema, not eating vegetables and fruits, and paternal occupation were found to be associated with anemia. Only the age of a child was associated with leukocytosis in undernourished children.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The current study demonstrated the predominant existence of anemia, leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis among undernourished under-five children. Therefore, early diagnosis, monitoring and setting intervention strategies for anemia especially among children under two years old are required to prevent further complication."
