    "<i>Anisakis simplex</i> (s.l.) is a complex of three sibling (biological) species of parasitic nematodes of marine mammals, including <i>A. berlandi</i>, <i>A. pegreffii</i> and <i>A. simplex</i> (s.s.). It is characterized by a complex life cycle in which humans can become accidental hosts by consuming dishes made of raw or undercooked fish containing L3 larvae, which in many regions of the world is related to the national or regional culinary tradition. This has spurred scientific efforts to develop new methods for treating the disease, called anisakiasis, and to neutralize invasive L3. Thiabendazole (TBZ) is a wide-spectrum anthelminthic with a higher efficacy than albendazole, a drug whose long-term use induces resistance in many parasitic species. Cytochromes P450 participate in TBZ metabolism, and the expression of their genes is controlled by nuclear hormone receptors (NHR). This study aimed to examine the effects of TBZ on the above-described pathway in invasive larvae of <i>A. simplex</i> (s.l.). The efficacy of TBZ against <i>A. simplex</i> (s.l.) larvae was observed for the first time. Larvae were cultured in vitro for 72 h in a medium containing TBZ at five concentrations from 0.5 to 1.5 mM. However, the survival curves did not significantly differ from each other. This means that all of the concentrations of TBZ had a similar effect on the <i>A. simplex</i> (s.l.) L3 larvae during in vitro culture. Nevertheless, TBZ modified the expression of <i>nhr-48</i>, <i>cyp13a3</i> and <i>cyp1a1</i> genes in the L3 of <i>A. simplex</i> (s.l.)."
