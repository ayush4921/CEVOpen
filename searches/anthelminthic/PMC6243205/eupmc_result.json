    "<i>Gasterophiline</i> larvae are of veterinary and medical importance caused specific equine intestinal myiasis. <i>Gasterophilus intestinalis</i> (Botfly larvae) had a wide geographical distribution. The present study explores the prevalence rate of <i>G. intestinalis</i> 3<sup>rd</sup> stage larvae in Egypt from January- December 2017; besides, in vitro trials to control of this larvae and evaluation of this trial using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and histopathology of treated larvae. In the present study, the 3<sup>rd</sup> larval stage of <i>G. intestinalis</i> was found in clusters in the epithelium of the investigated stomach and infested with prevalence rate 97.2%. The highest collected numbers of larvae were found in two months; March and August (570 & 520 larvae) and lowest numbers (200 larvae) were collected in October, November, and December. The calculated LC<sub>50</sub> and LC<sub>90</sub> values of neem seed extract were 707.9 ppm and 1090.7 ppm. The different alteration was recorded after exposure to oil extract which showed some destruction on cuticle surface as folded and corrugated cuticle, destruction of maxillae with pits on its surface, disfigure and irregularity of cephalic spines. Histopathology of exposed <i>G. intestinalis</i> larvae showed different changes as thinning of cuticle at the different level (exocuticle, endocuticle, cell layers), degeneration of epithelial cells of the gut and different degree of necrosis was described. Life cycle of <i>G.intestinalis</i> was followed up after treatment with neem seed extract."
