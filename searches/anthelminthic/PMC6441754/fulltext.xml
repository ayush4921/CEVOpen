A liniment from <italic>Artemisia californica</italic> has recently been tested on patients affected by either acute pain or chronic pain conditions with great success.</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of sesquiterpene lactones (SLs), representing the majority in the Asteraceae family. Leucodin, &#x003b1;-santonin and sclareolide (three SLs) were chosen to undergo chemical modifications. This pool of molecules underwent molecular modeling experiments using an in-house program, WATGEN, predicting the water network and its contribution to the overall affinity of the enzyme-ligand complex. The anti-inflammatory activity and the ability of compounds to modulate COX-2 expression have been evaluated in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells and in RIF-1 cells treated according to the Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) protocols using Photoprin (PH) as photosensitizer. Furthermore, commercially available assay kits were used to evaluate the concentration of PGE-2 and the direct inhibition of COX-2. All the tested molecules fit well in the enzyme binding pocket, but to get a substantial inhibition of the expression and activity of the enzyme as well as a reduction in the PGE2 concentration, high concentrations of the compounds are needed. The only exceptions being leucodin itself and <bold>FP6</bold>, one of the &#x003b1;-santonin derivatives, presenting a CF<sub>3</sub> functional group. We believe that this class of compounds has some interesting potential in the treatment of pain and inflammation. Although, the activity seems to be due to a mechanism related to the expression of the COX enzymes rather than on a direct inhibition.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Pharmaceutical chemistry</kwd><kwd>Organic chemistry</kwd><kwd>Natural product chemistry</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">The Asteraceae is a plentiful plant grouping, formerly known as Compositae. One of the largest genus is the <italic>Artemisia</italic>&#x000a0;one with over 500 species. It is believed that the genus is named after Artemis, the Greek goddess of hunt, forests and childbirth, who gave artemisian plants to Chiron the Centaur (<xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">Wright, 2002</xref>). Common names, instead, include mugwort, wormwood and sagebrush. It is characterized by a great phytochemical variability according to the different geographical origins. In fact, they often are aromatic perennial herbs or low shrubs common in northern temperate areas in Asia, Europe, North America and North Africa (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Good, 1974</xref>). Some general features are alternate leaves, tiny flower heads, a flat, naked receptacle and tubular florets (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Allaby, 2006</xref>). Some species are grown with ornamental purposes and others, with the peculiar bitter taste of their leaves, are used as culinary herbs (<italic>A. dracunculus</italic>, for instance); although, medicinal properties are the ones worth considering. The importance of the <italic>Artemisia</italic>&#x000a0;genus has been frequently highlighted in folk-medicine, in fact these plants were used throughout different cultures such as European, Chinese, Mexican, Chumash Indian, etc.</p><p id="p0015">The most well-known <italic>Artemisia</italic>&#x000a0;plant is certainly <italic>A. Annua</italic>, for its anti-malarian activity. In ancient Chinese texts, it is called either <italic>cao hao</italic> or <italic>qing hao</italic>. As far back as 168 BC, it was recommended for the treatment of haemorrhoids, later also for intermittent fevers, lingering pain in bones and joints, etc. Nowadays, in the current Chinese pharmacopeia, the infusion of the dried herb is listed for the treatment of fevers and malaria (<xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">Willcox, 2009</xref>). This potent antimalarial activity is due to a sesquiterpene lactone, named artemisinin and derivatives of this molecule are now established as anti-malarial drugs (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Klayman, 1993</xref>). Chumash Indians adopted several Asteraceae members for their pain-relieving activity. <italic>A. californica</italic>, also known as California Sagebrush, was an important remedy as well: a poultice or hair wash for headache (<xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Timbrook, 1990</xref>), a decoction of the leaves and stems externally for colds, asthma and arthritis (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Adams, 2012</xref>) and a liniment made from this plant, bear grease or whale oil was used as a topical pain-killer. Recently, a new alcoholic liniment based on the original recipe with some variations, has showed interesting results in pain patients affected by arthritis, muscle and ligament strains, bruises, broken bones, low back pain and cancer (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Adams, 2012</xref>). <italic>A. californica</italic>, was used also by Costanoan Indians for toothache and to poultice wounds (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Adams, 2012</xref>). Finally, it is worth noticing its capability, maybe due to the presence of flavonoids, of inhibiting NO production, opening the possibility of future anti-inflammatory uses (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Messaudene, 2011</xref>). These activities are due to the varied and numerous classes of compounds present in the genus. They include: terpenoids, alkaloids, phenolics and polyacetylenes. One of the most prevalent and biologically relevant groups of molecules are sesquiterpenoids. They can account for a great proportion in the Asteraceae family and especially in the <italic>Artemisia</italic>&#x000a0;genus.</p><p id="p0020">Particularly, sesquiterpenoids that possess a lactone ring, precisely called sesquiterpene lactones (SLs), have raised attention in the medicinal chemistry field, due to their numerous biological activities, also known before the so-called &#x0201c;modern medicine&#x0201d;. Studies on SLs benefits in people focus on their anti-cancer activity; their potential is so impressive that some compounds entered clinical trials (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Ghantous et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). Their use as antimalarials has been known for centuries and they have emerging roles in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and other disorders such as diarrhoea, flu, and burns. Plus, they are responsible for other effects in the prevention of neurodegeneration (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez et&#x000a0;al., 1976</xref>). SLs are also alleged to reduce stomach ulcers protecting the gastric lining (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Giordano et&#x000a0;al., 1990</xref>). Not to mention their well-known anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, afterwards discussed in detail (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>).<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Leucodin, &#x003b1;-santonin and sclareolide structures.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0010">Fig.&#x000a0;1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p><p id="p0025">Leucodin, also called leukomisin and desacetoxymatricarin, isolated from several plants in the genus <italic>Artemisia</italic> including <italic>Artemisia californica</italic> (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Adams, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Fontaine et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>) is part of the pseudoguaianolides group. It is characterized by a cyclopentadienone rigid ring system. In leucodin, the lactone is in a 6&#x003b1;,7&#x003b2; conformation. The cyclopentadienone and perhaps the lactone rings may react with thiols in proteins to provide biological activity. Leucodin has been reported to inhibit COX2 (IC<sub>50</sub> 129 &#x003bc;g/ml) and inducible nitric oxide synthase, IC<sub>50</sub> 160 &#x003bc;g/ml (<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, guaianolides have often been highlighted for their potential use in several conditions (<xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Simonsen et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). It seemed, therefore, interesting to choose leucodin within the SLs present in <italic>A. californica</italic> to further study molecules with this carbon backbone. Unfortunately, most of the time sesquiterpenoids cannot be synthesised cost-effectively and extraction requires a lot of time and funds, too. Due to its cost, in fact, leucodin was purchased in such a small amount that attempts in synthesising derivatives were not advisable. Aiming to have a little variety in the carbon backbone, an eudesmanolide was taken into consideration: &#x003b1;-santonin. &#x003b1;-Santonin has been extracted from several <italic>Artemisia</italic> species, formerly used as an anthelminthic, but then removed from the market due to its serious hazards to patients' health. King's American Dispensatory of 1898 noted that oral administration of &#x003b1;-santonin could produce convulsions and death from respiratory paralysis as well as xanthopsia.</p><p id="p0030">Nowadays it is a promising agent for the synthesis of derivatives with anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activity. It showed, in fact, strong anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic properties against carrageenan-induced edema in rat paw. The exact mode of action is not elucidated, but it may be due to the suppression of kinin and prostaglandin formation (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Al-Harbi et&#x000a0;al., 1994</xref>).</p><p id="p0035">A derivative of santonin, (11S)-2&#x003b1;-bromo-3-oxoeudesmano-12,6&#x003b1;-lactone, was found to inhibit NF-kB translocation into the nucleus (<xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Tamura et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>). Santonin analogues have been synthesized and tested as cytotoxic agents for anticancer activity (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Arantes et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Ferreira et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). Inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase has been reported for some santonin derivatives (<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Schwarz et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). Santonin and its analogues also inhibit macrophage nitric oxide synthase (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Chen et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>), which is involved in inflammation. Moreover, a synthesis of leucodin from santonin has been reported (<xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">White et&#x000a0;al., 1969</xref>), thus it seemed a great shortcut to get the so precious pseudoguaianolide. Unfortunately, this synthesis pathway is not only long and intricate, but also it involves a photochemical approach, which turned out to be not available nor possible at that moment. Nevertheless, &#x003b1;-santonin was chosen for its structural peculiarities and known biological properties; besides, being commercially available at an affordable price, it allowed the synthesis of several derivatives. Finally, to assess whether the lactone itself has a role, a molecule with no other functional moieties needed to be tested. Sclareolide was then picked. Sclareolide, also called norambreinolide, is a fragrance used in cosmetics. It has been isolated from various species of <italic>Salvia</italic> and several other plants. It has the same labdane structure as the related compound sclareol. Concerning inflammation, sclareol was shown to decrease nitric oxide (NO) production, and the expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) proteins (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Huang et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr">Zhong et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">Coricello et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib97" ref-type="bibr">Carullo et al. 2016</xref>). Both sclareol and sclareolide demonstrated good antibacterial activities (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Hayet et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). In addition to that, a German patent studied diterpenes with a labdane structure (i.e. sclareol, sclareolide, ambrox, ambroxdiol) suitable for anti-inflammatory use (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Gerke et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>). Sclareolide inhibited 5-lipoxygenase with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 1 mg/ml. The aim of this study was to produce &#x003b1;-santonin and sclareolide derivatives and to evaluate their anti-inflammatory activity in order to study the structure-activity relationship of the new sesquiterpenic analogues.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methods and materials</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Organic synthesis</title><p id="p0040">All reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich.

The lowest yield (11%) was achieved for FP3. The reason could be the presence of the nitro group which is a very strong electron-withdrawing group and removes electron density from the system. Substituents containing fluorine atoms also did not get to high yields (38.2% for FP4 and 25% for FP6), but still higher than FP3. This is very likely because with halogens, inductive and resonance properties are competing and, even though the induction is prevailing, the general withdrawing effect is less powerful than the one produced by the &#x02013;NO<sub>2</sub>. After all, this procedure is straightforward and worked well.</p><p id="p0080">Method (c) was very effective with alkyl bromides easily leading to FP5 and FP9.</p><p id="p0085">Method (d) to get to <bold>FP11</bold> was not successful. This is most likely due to two main changes in the procedure described by the reference: N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) instead of CCl<sub>4</sub> and tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) instead of tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI). NBS was used because of the well-known CCl<sub>4</sub> carcinogenicity and TBAB was used because it was the one immediately available in our laboratories. The authors themselves say that using another phase-transfer catalyst instead of TBAI was not effective and using other reagents as sources for positive-halogen such as NBS did not afford satisfactory results.

The only noteworthy compound is FP6, which positive results in terms of biological activity agree with predictions made through molecular modeling. Its CF3 moiety is very well-known in pharmaceutical chemistry due to its flexibility and peculiar chemical and physiological stability (<xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">Yale, 1958</xref>). It is also present in celecoxib itself. Therefore, it seems right to proceed on this path for future derivatives and studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="sec5.1"><title>Author contribution statement</title><p id="p0335">Luca Frattaruolo: Conceived and designed the experiments; Performed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data; Wrote the paper.</p><p id="p0340">Filomena Perri: Conceived and designed the experiments; Wrote the paper.</p><p id="p0345">Matteo Brindisi: Conceived and designed the experiments; Performed the experiments.</p><p id="p0350">Ian Haworth: Conceived and designed the experiments.</p><p id="p0355">Angela Ferrario: Performed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data.</p><p id="p0360">Asma El-magboub, Charles Gomer: Performed the experiments.</p><p id="p0365">James Adams: Contributed reagents, materials, analysis tools or data.</p><p id="p0370">Francesca Aiello: Contributed reagents, materials, analysis tools or data; Wrote the paper.</p></sec><sec id="sec5.2"><title>Funding statement</title><p id="p0375">This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</p></sec><sec id="sec5.3"><title>Competing interest statement</title><p id="p0380">The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec id="sec5.4"><title>Additional information</title><p id="p0385">No additional information is available for this paper.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib2"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abid</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Husain</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Azam</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Synthesis and antiamoebic activity of new oxime ether derivatives containing 2-acetylpyridine/2-acetylfuran</article-title><source>Bioorg.
