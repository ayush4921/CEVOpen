    "Snakebite is an environmental hazard associated with a significant morbidity and mortality. Two main types of toxicity occur due to snakebite, namely vasculotoxicity and neurotoxicity. Neurotoxic snakebites present mainly with bilateral ptosis with dilated pupils and/or difficulty in breathing. <i>Jatropha curcas</i> belongs to the family <i>Euphorbiaceae</i> and is commonly referred to as \"Ratanjyot\" in Gujarati. It has got many medicinal uses such as anticancerous properties and bio-oil. There are very few cases of its toxicity in adults. Toxicity from it causes meiosis, vomiting, diarrhea, etc., We will hereby discuss one such patient who consumed <i>J. curcas</i> seeds intentionally, became drowsy and accidentally got bit by a snake, and then, the patient started having bilateral ptosis, but with normal-sized pupils. There is no case reported yet in the literature mentioning the combined toxicity of snakebite and <i>J. curcas</i>, so we thought to publish this first case report of its kind in the world, thus discussing its diagnosis, symptoms, and treatment modalities."
