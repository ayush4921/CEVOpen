Particularly for parasites with intestinal stages (either larval or adult), the host gut microbiome may play a key role for parasite establishment; moreover, the microbiome may change in response to invading parasites. Hypothesis testing at the organismal level may be hampered, particularly in mammalian definitive hosts, by ethical, logistical, and economical restrictions. Thus, invertebrates naturally serving as intermediate hosts to parasites with complex life cycles may inform the development of mammalian models as an early-stage host-parasite model. In addition, several important pathogens are vectored by insects, and insect gut microbiome-pathogen interactions may provide essential base-line knowledge, which may be used to control vectorborne pathogens. Here, we used the grain beetle, <italic>Tenebrio molitor</italic>, a host of the tapeworm <italic>Hymenolepis diminuta</italic>, to explore interactions between infection status and resident gut microbiota at two pre-determined time points (day two and seven) post infection. Using 16S/18S microbial profiling, we measured key parameters of the composition, relative abundance, and diversity of the host gut bacteriome and mycobiome. In addition, we quantified the systemic beetle immune response to infection by Phenoloxidase activity and hemocyte abundance. We found significant changes in the gut bacteriome and mycobiome in relation to infection status and beetle age. Thus, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria was significantly higher in the gut of infected beetles and driven mostly by an increased abundance of Acinetobacter. In addition, the mycobiome was less abundant in infected beetles but maintained higher Shannon diversity in infected compared with non-infected beetles. Beetles treated with a broad-spectrum antibiotic (Tetracycline) exhibited significantly reduced parasite establishment compared with the untreated control group, indicating that the host microbiome may greatly influence hatching of eggs and subsequent establishment of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>diminuta</italic> larvae. Our results suggest that experimental work using invertebrates may provide a platform for explorative studies of host-parasite-microbe interactions and their underlying mechanisms.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008398</institution-id><institution>Villum Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>00007457</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4837-5974</contrib-id><name><surname>Fredensborg</surname><given-names>Brian L.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The study was funded by a grant (no. 00007457) to Brian L.

Priority has been given to the increasingly recognized role of the host gut microbiome to organism health, suggesting that the microbiome contributes to the maintenance of gut homeostasis, local immune function, and presumably also systemic immune responses reaching beyond the gut environment [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In humans, accumulating evidence link the gut microbiome to both dietary preference [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and the occurrence of several chronic diseases, e.g., inflammatory bowel diseases [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], type 2 diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Helminths and protozoa residing in the gut may alter the composition of the gut microbiome [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and those interactions may have important downstream effects on host immunity and gut homeostasis [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Little, however, is known about larval stages of helminths that are transmitted faecal-orally, the presence of which in the gut is transitory because they penetrate the gut epithelium and migrate to other host tissues. Larvae might be able to stimulate alterations in gut microbial composition by providing resources for bacterial growth from chitinous-rich egg shells, change the physical environment of the gut, and/or induce local inflammatory responses from breaching the gut epithelium as part of their migration trajectory.</p><p>The gut microbiome may also have important direct and indirect effects on parasite establishment, indicating a three-way interaction between host, gut microbes, and the parasite [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, parasite-gut microbiome interactions still represent a relatively recent field of study, and the underlying mechanisms of parasite-induced gut microbiome alterations and host immune modulation remain an undeveloped field of research [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>The use of mammalian animal models to study host-parasite interactions has a long history and accounts for most of our knowledge on e.g. immunomodulatory effects of helminths on their hosts [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], which has informed the treatment of autoimmune diseases in humans [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, there are important ethical and logistical restrictions associated with the use of mammals in experimental research, and sample sizes of vertebrates are restricted by animal ethics legislation according to the 3R&#x02019;s (reduce, refine, replace [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]), and husbandry and maintenance costs. Thus, alternative animal models, which allow fast hypothesis testing at both tissue and organismal level, may both reduce and refine subsequent testing that involves conventional animal models.</p><p>Insects serving as intermediate hosts of larval stages of helminths or as hosts to other pathogens potentially provide suitable models to address basic conceptual ideas and hypotheses on host-parasite interactions [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Insects also serve as vectors to pathogens residing in the gut where the gut microbiota may influence the biology of the pathogen and its capacity to transmit to a new host [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. There is therefore an increasing interest in utilizing insect vector microbial composition to control vector-borne diseases [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>The use of insects in research has a long history within genetic, behavioral and physiological sciences. Insects have been used to elucidate important immunological pathways (the Toll pathway was first described in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]), and to study interactions between bacterial pathogens and the innate immune system, which in insects is similar to that observed in higher vertebrates including humans [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In addition, insects may also provide basic information on gut-microbiota interactions in the absence of infection because of the relative simplicity of microbial diversity compared with that of vertebrates [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>The present study used the grain beetle <italic>Tenebrio molitor</italic>, which is a natural intermediate host of the tapeworm <italic>Hymenolepis diminuta</italic>, to explore basic interactions between a migratory larval helminth and the gut microbiota of its host. Adult <italic>H</italic>. <italic>diminuta</italic> reside in the small intestine of rats releasing egg-filled proglottids into the feces and thereby further into the external environment. <italic>Tenebrio molitor</italic> and other omnivorous beetles ingesting infected rat feces serve as intermediate hosts. Following ingestion, <italic>H</italic>. <italic>diminuta</italic> eggs hatch into active oncosphere larvae by mechanical rupture by the mandibles and subsequent enzymatic activation in the gut of the beetle [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Oncospheres penetrate the intestinal epithelium within 120 minutes of ingestion by the action of hooks and proteolytic enzymes, and migrate to the body cavity where they encyst into infective cysticercoids within 14 days at 25 &#x000ba;C [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>T</italic>. <italic>molitor</italic>-<italic>H</italic>. <italic>diminuta</italic> association is a well-known model for studies on host-parasite ecology [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and experimental infection protocols for standardizing parasite infection age and inoculation load exist [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In addition, the model is suitable for testing the effects of potential anthelmintics on adult parasites [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. <italic>Hymenolepis diminuta</italic> is known to modify the gut microbiome in the rat definitive host [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and recent proteomics studies indicated several proteomic similarities between the adult and larval stages of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>diminuta</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. We therefore hypothesize that a grain beetle model may offer an appropriate alternative to a rat model for testing the inverse association between the host gut microbiome and helminth infection. Hence, the beetle model may be used to identify whether the transitory nature of the oncosphere-gut interactions is sufficient to produce persistent alterations in the host gut microbiome.</p><p>Here, we used 16S/18S rDNA sequencing of the gut microbiome of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>molitor</italic> to identify changes in the composition of bacteria and fungi upon experimental exposure to <italic>H</italic>. <italic>diminuta</italic> eggs. In addition, we quantified the effect of parasite infection on the generalized constitutive immune response of the beetles to explore any correlation to the composition of the gut microbiome. In a second experiment, we used artificially induced gut perturbation by antibiotics to test the potential effect of the gut microbiota on the establishment of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>diminuta</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>The influence of parasite infection on host gut microbiota</title><sec id="sec004"><title>Sterilizing <italic>Hymenolepis diminuta</italic> eggs</title><p><italic>Hymenolepis diminuta</italic> eggs were sterilized using the protocol by [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] with modification. <italic>H</italic>. <italic>diminuta</italic> eggs were harvested from 1&#x02013;7-day-old rat feces from two infected rats (<italic>Rattus norvigecus</italic>, Wistar strain) hosted at the Panum Institute, University of Copenhagen (Permit no. 2014-15-0201-00387). Twenty grams of fecal pellet was collected from cage bedding material and soaked in water for one hour. Subsequently, the fecal suspension was poured through a double layer of gauze (mesh size, 1 x 1 mm) followed by a 100-&#x003bc;L mesh sieve to separate large fragments and debris, and the eggs were then collected on a 63-&#x003bc;L mesh sieve and transferred to a 50-mL Falcon tube.

This is noticeable, as <italic>H</italic>. <italic>diminuta</italic> is only a transient visitor of the host gut, where larval stages penetrate the gut epithelium 30&#x02013;120 minutes after hatching from the ingested egg [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The remaining development of the tapeworm takes place in the hemocoel of the beetle. This may suggest that the continued presence of the parasite in the gut is not an absolute requirement for the changes in the gut microbiome, and further that a continuous stimulation of the gut epithelium by parasite excretory-secretory products or continuous resource competition as described for chronic intestinal helminth infections of vertebrates [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] is not an absolute requirement for such changes to take place. Instead, we hypothesize two alternative mechanisms that are not mutually exclusive to explain the observed changes to the beetle gut microbiome.</p><p>Firstly, parasite stimulation of the innate immune system of the beetles may have caused the modification of the gut microbiome. The insect immune system consists of a non-specific cellular constitutive component (hemocytes), which is immediately responsive to infectious agents in conjunction with enzyme cascades (phenoloxidase). In addition, the innate immune system contains an inducible localized response by the production and release of specific antimicrobial peptides (AMP), which takes up to 48 hours to take effect but subsequently lasts for weeks [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. These are important in the regulation of potentially harmful bacteria in the gut microbiome and the maintenance of gut homeostasis [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Onchosphere larvae penetrate the gut epithelium by the aid of hooks and proteolytic enzymes, a process which potentially stimulates a localized inducible response (AMP) as well as a systemic constitutive response if gut bacteria cross the epithelial barrier and enter the body cavity. Our study did not indicate that gut microbes crossed the gut epithelial barrier since neither hemocyte numbers nor PO activity were upregulated after experimental infection. It is possible that parasite excretory-secretory (ES) products (e.g. exosomes) released immediately after infection may have induced a persistent down-regulation of host gene expression for a constitutive immune response, but at present there is no evidence supporting persistent effects of parasite ES products on host immunity. In contrast, AMP activation may affect the resident microbial composition [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], and our data suggest that the reduction in <italic>Enterobacter</italic> observed for infected beetles on day seven post infection may have facilitated the increased relative abundance of <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0227561.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). The inducible nature of AMP&#x02019;s could also explain why changes to the composition of the gut microbiome were not detected on day two post infection, but that they were evident on day seven post infection. In future studies, production of antimicrobial peptides or at least their gene expression should be measured in gut epithelial tissue before and several days after experimental infection of the beetles to evaluate the contribution of AMP&#x02019;s to gut microbiome composition.</p><p>Gut penetration by oncospheres may also alter the physical/chemical environment including the redox potential with possible indirect effects on microbial composition. Our results show that the gut of infected beetles by day seven was dominated by the aerobe <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> at the expense of the facultative anaerobe group of <italic>Enterobacter</italic>, and anaerobe members of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Thus, parasite penetration to the much more oxidized environment of the beetle gut cavity could have produced a temporary change in gut redox potential stimulating facultatively aerobe bacteria.</p><p>Finally, a previous study proposed that chitin from parasite egg-shells may serve as microbial nutrition, stimulating specific elements of the bacterial flora [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In our study, eggs were only introduced once, and we consider it an unlikely cause to the changes in microbial composition observed seven days later.</p><p>Whatever the exact mechanism(s) of parasite-induced changes to the host gut microbiome, our study suggests that even transient interactions between larval helminths and the gut microbiome of their hosts may modify the microbial composition of the gut. To our knowledge this has not been documented previously, and it may have general implications for understanding the effect of helminth eggs or larvae (e.g., taeniids and ascarid nematodes), which transiently pass through the gut of intermediate and aberrant hosts (including humans).</p><p>Infected beetles displayed a significantly higher alpha diversity of fungi on day seven post infection compared with non-infected individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227561.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). This difference in diversity reflected a decrease in diversity in the non-infected group in contrast to the stable diversity observed in infected beetles. The difference on day seven was probably due to the reduction in the most dominant genus <italic>Hypopichia</italic> in the infected group, facilitating an increase in a number of other subordinate taxa (e.g. <italic>Penicillum</italic> and <italic>Alternaria</italic>).</p><p>There is a high degree of concordance between mycobiome and bacteriome composition among the samples. This is likely caused by treatment and infection status having a unique impact on both, rather than interactions between particular organisms. Both symbiotic and antagonistic relationships between members of the mycobiome and microbiome communities are likely to exist. However, since the effect of treatment and infection are so dominant, and since splitting samples by time and infection status results in very small sample sets, a much larger data set is required to examine interactions between the bacteriome and the mycobiome.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Effects of host gut microbiota on parasite establishment success</title><p>Previous studies on mammalian gut helminths showed that hatching of parasite eggs was facilitated by the resident gut bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and that bacterial stimulation of egg hatching was parasite species-specific as close relatives are not equally stimulated by the host gut bacterial composition [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In this study, we found a significant reduction in parasite establishment in beetles when the gut microbiota had been perturbed by tetracycline prior to the experimental infection. This suggests that the gut bacteria interact with the eggs of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>diminuta</italic> either directly or indirectly by influencing the abiotic environment facilitating hatching of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>diminuta</italic> eggs. The latter may be very important as hatching of helminth eggs is stimulated by a combination of specific abiotic cues such as gut pH, oxidation-reduction potential, temperature, and enzymatic concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Given the restricted time of opportunity for hatching and penetration of the gut epithelium (30&#x02013;120 min)[<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], even slight deviations from optimal conditions could greatly reduce parasite establishment success. However, parasite establishment was not completely inhibited as some cysticercoids were recovered also from antibiotic-treated beetles, which is in agreement with observations by [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] who successfully infected germ-free <italic>T</italic>. <italic>molitor</italic> with eggs of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>diminuta</italic>.</p><p>Interestingly, the infection of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> in <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitos resembles that of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>diminuta</italic> in beetles as <italic>Plasmodium</italic> transiently resides in the mosquito gut before crossing the gut epithelial layer to develop as oocysts in the hemocoel.

In another important vector-borne pathogen, <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, the gut microbiome of the triatomine insect vector may also directly interact with the developing parasite through competition for resources [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p><p>We investigated changes to the host gut microbiome on day two and day seven post infection. However, we did not study if the observed changes were persistent, or if the microbiome composition of the infected group of beetles over time became increasingly similar to that of the non-infected group. This is particularly relevant since the gut involvement of the infection is temporary. Therefore, future studies should sample the host gut microbiome over a longer period (e.g. weeks). Additionally, it would be relevant to examine the effect of host age at the time of infection on gut microbiome composition as a function of infection status. The composition of the gut microbiome clearly changed with host age, but potential interactions between infection status and age are unknown.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec021"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study demonstrates that parasites modulate insect host gut microbiomes, and that the composition of the insect gut biome affects parasite establishment success. Hence, insects may be used as an inexpensive and fast model for studying host-parasite-microbiota interactions. Furthermore, this study supports the notion that the insect gut microbiome may contribute important knowledge to future control of vector-borne diseases [<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227561.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Due to the different composition of the gut microbiome and the lack of an adaptive immune system of insects, results obtained from our model may not necessarily translate directly to mammalian models. However, an insect model may serve as a generator of generally applicable hypotheses related to host-pathogen-microbe interactions and their underlying mechanisms. For example, our study indicated that helminth larvae migrating through the gut produce changes in the gut microbiota despite the transitory nature of interaction. The insect model has the great advantage of providing complete organism responses to infection, yet remaining cost-effective and ethically sound where large sample sizes and complex experimental designs are warranted. Insects may be relevant in generating new hypotheses related to the mechanistic insights of parasite-gut microbiome interactions, and in directing research questions in more complex e.g. mammalian models. Thus, the insect model provides a way to generate a considerable amount of data, while at the same time reducing the need for vertebrates used in the early stages of research (in agreement with the 3R&#x02019;s). Insect models may therefore have considerable commercial potential in biomedical research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227561.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><p>Relative abundance of the ten most abundant A) prokaryotic, and B) eukaryotic genera in relation to treatment at 48 h after treatment with Tetracycline (pooled data from beetles receiving either 5 mg mL<sup>-1</sup> or 10 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>).
