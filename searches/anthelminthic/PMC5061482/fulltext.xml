Control is achieved by periodic deworming, and at present, two anthelmintics, i.e. albendazole and mebendazole are used in deworming programs in endemic regions. However, it has been recently reported that the global coverage of periodic deworming is still not sufficiently meeting target levels in all endemic regions [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As per the WHO latest data, in 2013, only 40% of children requiring treatment for intestinal helminths had access to anthelminthic medicines, and to the remaining 60% of children, these medicines were not accessible [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In many developing countries, people are still dependent on various herbal treatments to cure worm infections [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. For example, in Asia, Africa, and some parts of Latin America, the herbal medicines, traditional treatments, and traditional practitioners constitute the main source of health care to treat various common ailments including intestinal worm infections [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Thus, these herbal medicines hold a great scope for not only new drug discoveries against parasitic diseases but also for further exploration for scientific evidence regarding the treatment and control of intestinal helminthiasis [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p><italic>Acorus calamus</italic> Linn. (Araceae), commonly known as &#x0201c;sweet flag,&#x0201d; is a perennial herb [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. It is mostly found in swampy or marshy habitats in northern temperate and subtropical regions of Asia, North America, and Europe [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The rhizomes of this plant possess numerous medicinal properties and have been very widely used against several diseases and ailments, particularly in Indian, Chinese, Korean, and Thai medicines [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the Indian ayurvedic medicine, the rhizomes of <italic>A. calamus</italic> are used to treat mental ailments such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, and memory disorders, as well as diarrhea, bronchial catarrh, intermittent fevers, cough, and asthma [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In Indian folk medicines, <italic>A. calamus</italic> rhizomes are considered useful against diseases of nervous system, throat, and as an antitumor, antipyretic, and antitussive agent [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In Thai medicine, <italic>A. calamus</italic> rhizomes have been used for blood purification and as an antipyretic [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, experimental studies have also shown that <italic>A. calamus</italic> rhizomes possess anticonvulsant [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], antidiarrheal [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], antimicrobial [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], antibacterial [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and anti-inflammatory activities [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Similarly, McGaw <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] have also reported that <italic>A. calamus</italic> rhizomes are used in traditional medicine in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa as an anthelmintic. The &#x000df;-asarone isolated from the rhizome of <italic>A. calamus</italic> has shown significant <italic>in vitro</italic> anthelmintic effects against <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In another <italic>in vitro</italic> study, the active principle of this plant also showed a fast acting paralytic effect that was followed by mortality in the larvae of dog roundworm, <italic>Toxocara canis</italic> [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It would thus appear from aforesaid account that although few studies have established the <italic>in vitro</italic> anthelmintic effects of this plant, except one, no report is available regarding the <italic>in vivo</italic> anthelmintic effects of this plant against human intestinal helminths. The only <italic>in vivo</italic> study on anthelmintic effects of this plant was undertaken by M&#x000e4;gi <italic>et al</italic>. in Estonia [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In this study, the dried rhizome powder of <italic>A. calamus</italic> was tested for its nematicidal effects against <italic>Oesophagostomum</italic> spp. infections in pigs, and was found to significantly lower down the worm burden and eggs per gram (EPG) of feces counts of animals [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><italic>Acorus calamus</italic>. (a) whole plant, (b) local medicine men collecting the tubers of plant, (c) partly-processed rhizomes</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JIE-5-390-g001"/></fig><p>One of the special features of <italic>A. calamus</italic> is that it exhibits a polyploidy nature and as many as four karyotypes of this plant (i.e. diploid, triploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid) are known which have been reported to follow geographical patterns of distribution in various regions of the world [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Interestingly, he karyotypes of <italic>A. calamus</italic> also vary greatly in their qualitative and quantitative composition of essential oil which contains b-asarone, its anthelmintic active principle. The content of b-asarone in calamus oil has been reported to be high, i.e., 70-96% in tetraploids, low around 5-19% in triploids plants, and zero in diploid plants [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Kumar <italic>et al</italic>. tested the essential oils from <italic>A. calamus</italic> collected from different locations in the Himalayan region of India and observed that all the oils differed in their qualitative and quantitative makeup, although b-asarone was the major constituent of all of them which revealed a potent <italic>in vitro</italic> activity on poultry roundworm, <italic>Ascaridia galli</italic> [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In India, <italic>A. calamus</italic> grows mostly in wild in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura states, etc. In recent years, a significant body of literature has emerged that presents contradictory findings about the ploidy status and contents of b-asarone in Indian <italic>A. calamus</italic> populations. For example, Ogra <italic>et al</italic>. reported that most of the accessions of <italic>A. calamus</italic> from India are triploids (except only few which are diploids) with b-asarone content in their oil varies from 82% to 89.4% [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Conversely, Ahlawat <italic>et al</italic>. opined that most of the <italic>A. calamus</italic> accessions in India are predominantly tetraploids with the b-asarone content in their oil ranging between 73% and 88%, and triploid varieties are rather rare with b-asarone content in their oils ranging between 6.92% and 8.0% [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus, it would appear that b-asarone content in <italic>A. calamus</italic> oil is of paramount importance as it can affect the perceived therapeutic efficacy of this plant from one geographical region to another. As is evident none of the previous studies have standardized the amount of b-asarone in the rhizome oil of <italic>A. calamus</italic> with regard to its <italic>in vivo</italic> anthelmintic effects. The present study was, therefore, undertaken to evaluate the <italic>in vivo</italic> anthelmintic efficacy of a standardized methanol extract from the rhizomes of <italic>A. calamus</italic>, using experimentally induced <italic>Hymenolepis diminuta</italic> (a zoonotic tapeworm species) infections in Wistar rats.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Plant Material</title><p>The rhizomes of <italic>A. calamus</italic> [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>] were collected from North Tripura district of Tripura (24&#x000b0; 36&#x02019; N latitude and 92&#x000b0; 19&#x02019; E longitude) in October 2010. The plant specimen was identified by a Curator in the Department of Botany, North-Eastern Hill University (NEHU), Shillong, and a voucher specimen (No. AKY-11883) has been retained in the Department of Zoology, NEHU. The rhizomes were dried under shade and ground into fine powder form. Plant material was extracted with different solvents, n-hexane, n-butanol, chloroform, ethyl acetate, acetone, methanol, and water using Soxhlet extractor at 40&#x000b0;C for 4-5 h. The process was repeated thrice with fresh solvent. The ratio of sample to solvent was 1:10 (m/v). Each extract was subsequently filtered, and the filtrates were concentrated under reduced pressure in a vacuum rotary evaporator. The crude extracts were subjected to thin layer chromatography (TLC) plate, and the separation pattern of the extract was monitored in chloroform and methanol (9:1), which showed distinct separated spots. The methanol extract gave maximum number of spots in TLC, and therefore, it was selected for <italic>in vivo</italic> testing. The final yield of methanol extract was 15% (w/w).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Characterization of Active Component</title><p>Sample preparation for column chromatography was done by adsorption of extract on activated (105&#x000b0;C, 30 min) silica gel (100-200 mesh) with ratio 1:10, respectively. Extract was kept for drying in a rotary evaporator, and finally, lyophilized until free flowing material was formed. The dried free flowing prepared sample was subjected to column chromatography using a 20 cm &#x000d7; 2.5 cm glass column filled with silica gel (mesh size: 100-200, SRL) in n-hexane. Prepared sample of methanol extract was added to the free volume at the head of the column. After settling down of the material, fractionation was conducted over silica gel with n-hexane/chloroform (98:2-90:10) solvent system. Fractions were collected, and the solvent was removed to reduce volume of fraction by evaporation in vacuum at 40&#x000b0;C. Dried fractions were suspended in chloroform:methanol (3:1) and diluted when necessary. In each solvent preparation, five fractions were collected and monitored by TLC method (n-hexane:chloroform [9:1]). Separation pattern of fractions on TLC plate was observed by iodine vapor. After concentrating and left standing for overnight, purity of the entire fraction was tested on TLC plate. Fraction no. 3-8 showed single spot on TLC plate. A pale yellow liquid of R<sub>f</sub> value 0.42 was obtained in n-hexane:chloroform (9:1) on precoated TLC plate (Aluchrosep Silica Gel 60/UV254, SD fine, size 5 cm &#x000d7; 20 cm and 0.2 mm thickness). To confirm the purity of isolated compound, parallel spot was run on TLC plate with standard b-asarone in n-hexane/chloroform (9:1). The purity of this compound, yellow oil, was confirmed by TLC using various solvent systems and <sup>1</sup>H NMR.</p><p>The chemical structure of the calamus oil isolated fraction was predicted through detailed spectroscopic procedures- <sup>1</sup>H NMR, <sup>13</sup>C NMR, mass and infrared (IR) spectroscopy. IR spectrum was recorded in chloroform on a Fourier transform IR spectrophotometer (Nicolet Impact 1-410) calibrated against the polystyrene absorption at 1601 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Mass spectrum was recorded by liquid chromatography (LC) - mass spectrometry using waters ZQ-4000 mass spectrometer. <sup>1</sup>H NMR (300 MHz) and <sup>13</sup>C NMR (75 MHz) spectra were recorded using CDCl<sub>3</sub> as solvent in a Bruker Avance II-400 NMR machine, considering tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an initial standard and chemical shift values were in d ppm values. Spectra were referenced to TMS (<sup>1</sup>H) or solvent (<sup>13</sup>C) signals. Fraction containing active compound was further applied to reverse-phase high-performance LC (RP-HPLC) system (SHIMADZU, LCIOAT, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with Shimadzu SPD-10A ultraviolet-visible detector. RP-HPLC analysis was carried out in isocratic conditions using C<sub>18</sub> reverse phase column with a particle size of 5 &#x000b5;m, 250 mm &#x000d7; 4.6 mm. Samples were filtered through 0.45 &#x000b5;m ultra-membrane filters (Millipore, Germany). Running conditions included: Injection volume, 20 &#x000b5;l; mobile phase, methanol:0.5% acetic acid in water (75:25 v/v); flow rate, 1 ml/min; and detection wavelength at 210 nm. The calibration curves of b-asarone were linear from 0.01~100 &#x000b5;g/ml (<italic>r</italic> = 0.994, <italic>n</italic> = 6).

The findings of our study are in agreement with the findings of two previous studies by Yadav and Tangpu and Yadav <italic>et al.</italic>, wherein the treatment of <italic>H. diminuta</italic> infected rats by <italic>Solanum myriacanthum</italic> fruit extract revealed 60.49% reduction in the EPG counts and 56.60% reduction in worm counts, and by <italic>Gynura angulosa</italic> leaf extract showed 78.60% reduction in EPG counts and 70.75% reduction in worm counts of animals [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>In this study, the anthelmintic effects of plant active principle, b-asarone were noted to be slightly better than crude extract and it caused up to 92% of worm reductions in experimental animals. In a related testing of root tuber, extract of <italic>Carex baccans</italic> (a traditional anthelmintic plant of India) and its active principle resveratrol revealed slightly lower anthelmintic efficacy [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This study revealed that treatment of rats by extract of <italic>C. baccans</italic> and resveratrol results into 56.01% and 46.05% EPG reductions, and 44.28% and 31.03% decrease in worm burden, respectively. In the study by Magi <italic>et al.</italic>, the rhizome extract of <italic>A. calamus</italic> tested at 5 g/kg dose against pig-nodular worm <italic>Oesophagostomum</italic> spp. also showed 98% reduction of worm burden in pigs [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It thus appears from these studies that <italic>A. calamus</italic> rhizomes do possess potent <italic>in vivo</italic> anthelmintic effects.</p><p>In the current study, the chemical structure of isolated purified compound was predicted using various spectroscopic analytical procedures and found related to b-asarone. The spectral data of isolated purified when compared with the existing literature [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] showed similar spectral patterns and hence was identified as b-asarone. The yield of b-asarone was calculated to be 83.54% (w/w) in the isolated fraction, which indicates that local variety of <italic>A. calamus</italic> in this area is tetraploid in nature.</p><p>In acute toxicity assay, treatment of mice by a single oral dose of 2000 mg/kg of plant extract did not reveal any signs of toxicity or mortality within the 2-week observation period, and therefore, the LD50 of the extract was interpreted to be &#x0003e;2000 mg/kg. According to the globally harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals, substances having an LD50 value &#x0003e;2000 mg/kg are considered as relatively safe [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Therefore, it can be suggested that rhizome extract of <italic>A. calamus</italic> is practically devoid of any acute oral toxic effects in experimental animals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Taken together, the results of this study show that the rhizomes of <italic>A. calamus</italic> bear significant dose-dependent effects against intestinal helminths, and the local Indian variety of this plant contains high b-asarone content. Therefore, there exists a great potential to develop some suitable anthelmintic herbal products from this plant.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>PN was recipient of a Research Fellowship in Science for Meritorious Students by the University Grants Commission, New Delhi.
