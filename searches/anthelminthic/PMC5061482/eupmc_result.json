    "<h4>Background</h4>The rhizomes of a herb <i>Acorus calamus</i> Linn. (Acoraceae) have been widely used as a traditional medicine to cure intestinal-helminthic infections in India and South Africa.<h4>Aim</h4>This study was undertaken to investigate the <i>in vivo</i> anthelmintic activity of a standardized methanolic extract obtained from the rhizomes <i>A. calamus</i> in a rodent model.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>A methanolic extract obtained from rhizomes of <i>A. calamus</i> was characterized for active principle using nuclear magnetic resonance <sup>1</sup>H NMR, <sup>13</sup>C NMR, mass and infrared spectroscopy. The amount of active principle in rhizome isolated active fraction of plant was assayed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Later, the standardized rhizome extract of plant and its active principle were tested for <i>in vivo</i> anthelmintic efficacy against experimentally induced <i>Hymenolepis diminuta</i>, a zoonotic cestode, infections in rats.<h4>Results</h4>The study revealed that b-asarone is the active principle of plant. The HPLC analysis of local variety of <i>A. calamus</i> revealed that active fraction contains 83.54% (w/w) of b-asarone. The <i>in vivo</i> study revealed that treatment of <i>H. diminuta</i> infected rats by a single 800 mg/kg dose of rhizome extract for 5 days results into 62.30% reduction in eggs per gram of feces counts and 83.25% reduction in worm counts of animals. These findings compared well with the efficacy of a reference drug, praziquantel. The active principle b-asarone showed slightly better anthelmintic effects than crude extract. In acute toxicity assay, a single oral 2000 mg/kg dose of extract did not reveal any signs of toxicity or mortality in mice, and the LD50 of the extract was noted to be >2000 mg/kg.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Taken together, the results of this study indicate that rhizomes of <i>A. calamus</i> bear significant dose-dependent effects against intestinal helminths. Further, the Indian variety of <i>A. calamus</i> contains high b-asarone content. Therefore, there exists a great potential to develop some suitable anthelmintic herbal products from this plant."
