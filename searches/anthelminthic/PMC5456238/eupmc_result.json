    "<b>Background:</b><i>Oncoba spinosa,</i> an endangered medicinal plant whose secondary metabolites have not been extensively profiled, and which is hitherto yet to be examined for cytotoxicity, is being investigated in this study. <b>Methods:</b> Leaves of <i>Oncoba spinosa</i> (800 g) were extracted with 95% aqueous methanol. The crude extract was partitioned with n-hexane and the resultant defatted extract was extensively chromatographed on silica gel to yield compound <b>1</b> which was subjected to spectroscopic analysis. A brine shrimps lethality test was used to establish the cytotoxicity potentials of the isolated compound and the plant extracts. <b>Results:</b> Compound <b>1</b> was elucidated as flacourtin, 3-hydroxy-4-hydroxymethylphenyl-6-<i>O</i>-benzoyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. The LD<sub>50</sub> values obtained were less than 1000 µg/mL for flacourtin and the plant extracts. <b>Conclusion:</b> Flacourtin is being reported for the first time in the <i>O. spinosa</i>. The preliminary toxicity assay indicated that flacourtin and the plant extracts were not cytotoxic; thus, the tradomedicinal uses of the plant may portend no danger."
