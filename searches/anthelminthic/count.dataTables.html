Regeneration was achieved from leaf segments of 20 days old in vitro plantlets raised on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 0.25-2.0 mg L(-1) thiadiazuron (TDZ), 3% sucrose, and 0.8% agar. After 21 days of culture incubation, maximum number of shoot organogenesis (23.6 ± 0.16) was obtained on medium containing 1.0 mg L(-1) TDZ. The shoots were able to produce in vitro flowers on medium containing 1.0 mg L(-1) TDZ in combination with 0.25-0.5 mg L(-1)  α-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA). Histological observation showed that the epidermal cells of the leaf explants exhibited continuous cell division led to formation of numerous dome shaped meristematic protrusions and subsequently developed into adventitious shoots. Upon transfer of shootlets to half strength MS medium containing 1.0 mg L(-1) indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), around 86% of the regenerated shoots formed roots and plantlets. Rooted plants were hardened and successfully established in the soil at the survival rate of 92%. The regeneration protocol developed in this study provides an important method of micropropagation of this plant. Furthermore, this protocol may be used for a large scale production of its medicinally active compounds and genetic transformations for further improvement.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:The detailed assessment of nematode activity and viability still remains a relatively undeveloped area of biological and medical research. Computer-based approaches to assessing the motility of larger nematode stages have been developed, yet these lack the capability to detect and analyze the more subtle and important characteristics of the motion of nematodes. There is currently a need to improved methods of assessing the viability and health of parasitic worms. METHODS:We describe here a system that converts the motion of nematodes through a light-scattering system into an electrical waveform, and allows for reproducible, and wholly non-subjective, assessment of alterations in motion, as well as estimation of the number of nematode worms of different forms and sizes. Here we have used Brugia sp. microfilariae (L1), infective larvae (L3) and adults, together with the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. RESULTS:The motion of worms in a small (200 ul) volume can be detected, with the presence of immotile worms not interfering with the readings at practical levels (up to at least 500 L1 /200 ul). Alterations in the frequency of parasite movement following the application of the anti-parasitic drugs, (chloroquine and imatinib); the anti-filarial effect of the latter agent is the first demonstrated here for the first time. This system can also be used to estimate the number of parasites, and shortens the time required to estimate parasites numbers, and eliminates the need for microscopes and trained technicians to provide an estimate of microfilarial sample sizes up to 1000 parasites/ml. Alterations in the form of motion of the worms can also be depicted. CONCLUSIONS:This new instrument, named a &quot;WiggleTron&quot;, offers exciting opportunities to further study nematode biology and to aid drug discovery, as well as contributing to a rapid estimate of parasite numbers in various biological samples.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Embelia schimperi has been used for the treatment of intestinal parasites especially tapeworm infestations for centuries in Ethiopia. However, there is lack of scientific based evidences regarding the efficacy, safety and phytochemical analysis of this plant despite its frequent use as an anthelmintic. This study has therefore evaluated the efficacy and acute toxicity of E. schimperi thereby generating relevant preclinical information.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The anthelmintic activities of the crude hydroalcoholic extract of E. schimperi and the isolated compound, embelin, were conducted using in vivo and in vitro models against the dwarf tapeworm, Hymenolepis nana, and the hookworm, Necator americanus, respectively. LD50 of the crude hydroalcoholic extract was determined using Swiss albino mice following the OECD guidelines. Chemical characterization of the isolated embelin was conducted using UV-spectroscopy, HPLC and NMR.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;In the acute toxicity study no prominent signs of toxicity and mortality were recorded among the experimental animals at the highest administered dose. Hence the LD50 of the plant was found to be higher than 5000 mg/kg. In vivo cestocidal activity of the crude hydroalcoholic extract of E. schimperi showed 100% parasite clearance at 1000 mg/kg, while the diammonium salt of embelin showed 85.3% parasite clearance at 750 mg/kg. The in vitro anthelminthic activity study revealed that the LC50 value of the crude extract and albendazole were 228.7 and 51.33 μg/mL, respectively.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The results clearly indicated that the hydroalcoholic extract of E. schimperi and the diammonium salt of the isolated compound embelin had anthelmintic activity against hookworm larva in vitro and H. nana in vivo. Hence the findings of this study showed Embelia schimperi appears to possess some anthelmintic activity that may support the usage of these plants by local traditional healers to treat helminthic infestations.">

Genes encoding the two proteins were separately cloned into a high-copy-number vector with a strong constitutive promoter (pTRK593) in Lactococcus lactis for potential oral delivery against parasitic nematode infections. Western blots using a Cry5B-specific antibody revealed that constitutively expressed Cry5B and tCry5B were present in both cells and supernatants. To increase production, cry5B was cloned into the high-copy-number plasmid pMSP3535H3, carrying a nisin-inducible promoter. Immunoblotting revealed that 3 h after nisin induction, intracellular Cry5B was strongly induced at 200 ng/ml nisin, without adversely affecting cell viability or cell membrane integrity. Both Cry5B genes were also cloned into plasmid pTRK1061, carrying a promoter and encoding a transcriptional activator that invoke low-level expression of prophage holin and lysin genes in Lactococcus lysogens, resulting in a leaky phenotype. Cry5B and tCry5B were actively expressed in the lysogenic strain L. lactis KP1 and released into cell supernatants without affecting culture growth. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays indicated that Cry5B, but not LDH, leaked from the bacteria. Lastly, using intracellular lysates from L. lactis cultures expressing both Cry5B and tCry5B, in vivo challenges of Caenorhabditis elegans worms demonstrated that the Cry proteins were biologically active. Taken together, these results indicate that active Cry5B proteins can be expressed intracellularly in and released extracellularly from L. lactis, showing potential for future use as an anthelminthic that could be delivered orally in a food-grade microbe.">

This survey study was conducted from April 2014 through March 2015 in Bauchi, Yobe, and Gombe states, northeastern Nigeria, to explore the risk factors associated with the occurrence of gastrointestinal helminthosis among indigenous donkeys (Equus asinus). Materials and Methods. A total of six hundred fresh faecal samples were randomly collected from indigenous donkeys of varying age, sex, and settlements. Simple flotation and sedimentation techniques were used for the detection of helminths eggs. Results. Three gastrointestinal nematode parasites were encountered including Strongyle, Parascaris equorum, and Oxyuris equi. An overall prevalence of 98.3% was obtained, of which 78.3%, 40.3%, and 17.5% were, respectively, from Strongyle, Parascaris equorum, and Oxyuris equi. Age, sex, and season were not statistically associated with the risk of helminth infection as were the different study areas (p &gt; 0.05). However, body condition score, settlement, anthelminthic medication history, and management practices were significantly associated with the risk of gastrointestinal helminthosis. Statistically high prevalence of helminthic infections was observed in donkeys, with poor (thin) body condition, from rural settlements, that were not dewormed and raised under poor management systems (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion. It is concluded from the study that gastrointestinal helminths particularly Strongyle were endemic among the indigenous donkeys in northeastern Nigeria. Further control and preventive measures were discussed.">

However, little is known about its biological activity or its effect on cancer cells. The aim of the present study was to determine the cytotoxic activity of &lt;i&gt;P. quercetorum&lt;/i&gt; extract on lung cancer cell lines with varying properties. Following the analyses of its chemical composition, the cytotoxic activity was screened by the adenosine triphosphate viability test. M30-Apoptosense&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; and M65 EpiDeath&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to determine the cell death mode (apoptosis vs. necrosis). For apoptosis, additional methods, including Annexin-V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and Hoechst 33342 staining, were employed. The cleavage of poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was assayed by western blotting to further dissect the apoptosis mechanism. The methanol extract of &lt;i&gt;P. quercetorum&lt;/i&gt; caused cytotoxic activity in a dose-dependent manner. The mode of cell death was apoptosis, as evidenced by the positive staining of the cells for Annexin-V-FITC and the presence of pyknotic nuclei.

Therefore, future &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; experiments are required for further understanding of the effect of this plant on cancer cells.">

        <span class="abst" title="Medicinal plants used for wound healing and skin diseases are the key to unlocking the doors to combating problematic skin diseases as resistance of pathogens to pharmaceuticals and allopathic management continues to increase. The study aimed at investigating the antimicrobial efficacies, phenolic content, and cytotoxicity effects of 11 medicinal plant extracts commonly used for treating skin conditions and wound healing in traditional medicine within KwaZulu-Natal. Eleven plant species were separated into different plant parts (bulbs, roots, leaves) and extracted with different solvents. The extracts were assessed for antimicrobial activity against six Gram-positive and seven Gram-negative bacterial strains and four fungi commonly associated with skin conditions using disc diffusion and microdilution techniques. The aqueous methanolic extracts were screened for phenolic content while cytotoxicity tests were performed on all extracts using the brine shrimp lethality and tetrazolium-based colorimetric (MTT) assays. Extracts from &lt;i&gt;Aloe ferox, A. arborescens&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Hypericum aethiopicum&lt;/i&gt; were the most active against almost all of the tested bacterial and fungal strains. All plant species exhibited some degree of antimicrobial activity. Total phenolic levels, flavonoids and tannins were also higher for &lt;i&gt;A. ferox&lt;/i&gt;, followed by &lt;i&gt;A. arborescens&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;H. aethiopicum&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. The cytotoxicity results of all plant extracts were in the range of 90-100% survival after 24 h in the brine shrimp assay. Extracts considered lethal would demonstrate &gt;50% shrimp death. The MTT cytotoxicity test yielded LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of &gt;1 mg/mL on all extracts indicating that they are not cytotoxic. The observed antimicrobial efficacy demonstrated by some plant species and the general lack of cytotoxic effects on all the tested extracts presents some promising and beneficial aspects of these medicinal plant extracts in the treatment of skin diseases and wound healing. The two &lt;i&gt;Aloe&lt;/i&gt; species and &lt;i&gt;H. aethiopicum&lt;/i&gt; were among the best extracts that exhibited consistently good antimicrobial activity and warrants further investigations and possible isolation of bioactive principles.">

The amount of active principle in rhizome isolated active fraction of plant was assayed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Later, the standardized rhizome extract of plant and its active principle were tested for &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; anthelmintic efficacy against experimentally induced &lt;i&gt;Hymenolepis diminuta&lt;/i&gt;, a zoonotic cestode, infections in rats.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The study revealed that b-asarone is the active principle of plant. The HPLC analysis of local variety of &lt;i&gt;A. calamus&lt;/i&gt; revealed that active fraction contains 83.54% (w/w) of b-asarone. The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; study revealed that treatment of &lt;i&gt;H. diminuta&lt;/i&gt; infected rats by a single 800 mg/kg dose of rhizome extract for 5 days results into 62.30% reduction in eggs per gram of feces counts and 83.25% reduction in worm counts of animals. These findings compared well with the efficacy of a reference drug, praziquantel. The active principle b-asarone showed slightly better anthelmintic effects than crude extract. In acute toxicity assay, a single oral 2000 mg/kg dose of extract did not reveal any signs of toxicity or mortality in mice, and the LD50 of the extract was noted to be &gt;2000 mg/kg.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Taken together, the results of this study indicate that rhizomes of &lt;i&gt;A. calamus&lt;/i&gt; bear significant dose-dependent effects against intestinal helminths. Further, the Indian variety of &lt;i&gt;A. calamus&lt;/i&gt; contains high b-asarone content. Therefore, there exists a great potential to develop some suitable anthelmintic herbal products from this plant.">

It is prevalent in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities and it is estimated that global infection could be as high as 370 million people. This paper explores current methods of strongyloidiasis treatment, which rely on administration of anthelminthic drugs. However these drugs cannot prevent reinfection and drug resistance has already been observed in veterinary models. This highlights the need for a combined approach for controlling &lt;i&gt;Strongyloides&lt;/i&gt; that includes both clinical treatment and environmental control methods. Currently, nematicides are widely used to control plant parasites. The review suggests that due to the species' similarity and similar modes of action, these nematicides could also be used to control animal and human parasitic nematodes in the environment.">

Literature survey about this plant shows that &lt;i&gt;A. bilimbi&lt;/i&gt; is mainly used as a folk medicine in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and as an antimicrobial agent. The prime objective of this review is to accumulate and organize literature based on traditional claims and correlate those with current findings on the use of &lt;i&gt;A. bilimbi&lt;/i&gt; in the management of different ailments. Through interpreting already published scientific manuscripts (1995 through 2015) retrieved from the different scientific search engines, namely Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, and Science Direct databases, published articles and reports covering traditional and scientific literature related to &lt;i&gt;A. bilimbi&lt;/i&gt;'s potential role against various ailments have been thoroughly evaluated, interpreted, and discussed. Several pharmacological studies have demonstrated the ability of this plant to act as antidiabetic, antihypertensive, thrombolytic, antimicrobial, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, and hypolipidemic agent. &lt;i&gt;A. bilimbi&lt;/i&gt; holds great value in the complementary and alternative medicine as evidenced by the substantial amount of research on it. Therefore, we aimed to compile an up-to-date and comprehensive review of &lt;i&gt;A. bilimbi&lt;/i&gt; that covers its traditional and folk medicine uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacology. Hence, this paper presents an up-to-date and comprehensive review of the ethnomedicinal uses, different chemical constituents, and pharmacological activities of &lt;i&gt;A. bilimbi&lt;/i&gt;. So far, the biologically active agents have not been isolated from this plant and this can be a good scientific study for the future antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and antimicrobial implications. Hence, this review targets at emphasizing the diverse traditional claims and pharmacological activities of &lt;i&gt;A. bilimbi&lt;/i&gt; with respect to carrying out more scientific studies to isolate active principles through advanced technology.">

To collect contemporary epidemiological information, a cross-sectional survey was undertaken inclusive of: signs and symptoms of disease, individual treatment histories, local water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)-related factors and malacological surveillance, with molecular characterisation of specimens.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;At each lake, a community cross-sectional survey was undertaken using a combination of stool and urine parasitological sampling, and interview with pro-forma questionnaires. A total of 338 children and adults participated. Material from snail and parasite species were characterised by DNA methods.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Egg-patent prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis was 8.7% at Barombi Mbo (all light-intensity infections) and 40.1% at Barombi Kotto (21.2% heavy-intensity infections). Intestinal schistosomiasis was absent. At Barombi Kotto, significantly more women reported signs and symptoms associated with female genital schistosomiasis. While there had been extensive recent improvement in WASH-related infrastructure at Barombi Mbo, water contact risk scores were higher among schistosomiasis-infected participants (P &lt; 0.001) and at Barombi Kotto in general (P &lt; 0.001). Across both lakes, mean prevalence of STH was very low (6.3%) evidencing an impressive decrease of 79.0% over the last decade; neither Strongyloides stercoralis nor Ascaris lumbricoides were found. A total of 29 freshwater sampling sites were inspected for snails, 13 in Barombi Mbo and 16 in Barombi Kotto; water chemistry differed significantly (P &lt; 0.0001) between lakes for both mean pH (7.9 v. 9.6) and mean conductivity (64.3 μS v. 202.1 μS) respectively. Only two Bulinus camerunensis found on the central island of Barombi Kotto were observed to shed schistosome cercariae, but schistosome DNA was later detected in Bulinus sampled from both lakes as well as in Indoplanorbis exustus, an invasive species from Asia.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;STH is currently at very low levels while urogenital schistosomiasis is of greatest concern at Barombi Kotto. This assessment highlights a unique opportunity for further study of the epidemiological dynamics at these crater lakes, to evaluate future intensified interventions both in terms of gaining and sustaining control at Barombi Kotto or in moving towards local interruption of transmission of both diseases at Barombi Mbo.">

There is a pressing need for new drugs against this disease whose control entirely depends on this single drug that has been widely used over the past 40 years. We argue that a broader anthelminthic approach supplementing praziquantel with new antischistosomals targeting different parasite development stages would not only increase efficacy but also reduce the risk for drug resistance. Repositioning drugs already approved for other diseases provides a shortcut to clinical trials, as it is expected that such drugs rapidly pass the regulatory authorities. The antischistosomal properties of antimalarial drugs (e.g., semisynthetic artemisinins, synthetic trioxolanes, trioxaquines and mefloquine) and of drugs being developed or registered for other purposes (e.g., moxidectin and miltefosin), administered alone or in combination with praziquantel, have been tested in the laboratory and clinical trials. Another avenue to follow is the continued search for new antischistosomal properties in plants. Here, we summarise recent progress made in schistosomiasis chemotherapy, placing particular emphasis on repositioning of existing drugs against schistosomiasis.">

Structural characterization was carried out using ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer, Fourier transform infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance, and thin-layer chromatography. The isolated compound was further evaluated for its bioactivity. The compound demonstrated moderate cytotoxicity in liver carcinoma (HepG2) cells, and the comparative analysis for the standard and normal compound has also been validated. Antioxidant potential was assessed by DPPH assay. Furthermore, efficacy of the compound in the aforesaid assays asserts its bioactivity and subsequently its importance as a potent therapeutic. Our study strongly suggests that Amentoflavone present in the leaf extracts of C. fistula L. definitely holds promise in the pharmaceutical industry.">

Furthermore, the chemical compositions of the essential oil of the aerial parts were identified by GC-MS analysis. Antiproliferative and antioxidant activities of all extracts from aerials were determined by MTT and DPPH assays, respectively. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Phytochemical investigation on the plant roots led to the isolation and identification of two the 60% methanol-water Sep-pak fraction, a prenylated flavone glycoside, 6-C-prenyl-7-O-[ β -D-4'''-O-acetyl-glucopyranosyl-(1'''→2'')-β-D-glucopyranosyl] apigenin, which was named as a Zygocaperoside and also, other flavonoid, was named as the Isorhamnetin -3-O glucoside. None of the extracts showed antiproliferative effect against cancerous cells. However, among the extracts, methanolic extract indicated antioxidant activity. Moreover, essential oils of flowers and leaves of plant have high amounts of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and diterpenoides. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The results of present study introduce Z. fabago roots as a new source of flavonoid glycosides and suggest it as an appropriate candidate for further pharmacological studies.">

Albendazole (0.025 mg/mL) and ivermectin (316 ppm) were used as positive controls. EHT and LMT were carried out through the incubation of each solution with S. venezuelensis eggs or larvae (± 100 specimens), and results were analyzed after 48h (EHT) or 24, 48, and 72h (LMT). EHT showed that latex preparations at higher concentrations (1:10 to 1:100) resulted in partial or complete destruction of eggs and larvae inside the eggs. The result from the 1:1,000 dilution was similar to the positive control. LMT showed effectiveness in all the tested dilutions compared to negative controls. Purified papain showed a dose-dependent response in the EHT. Purified papain (2.8 mg/ mL) showed similar results to lyophilized latex at 1:1,000 in the EHT. Latex and purified papain from C. papaya were effective against S. venezuelensis eggs and larvae in vitro, suggesting their potential use as an alternative treatment for strongyloidiasis.">

        <span class="abst" title="Present paper offers considerable information on traditional uses of medicinal plants by the inhabitants of Hafizabad district, Punjab-Pakistan. This is the first quantitative ethnobotanical study from the area comprising popularity level of medicinal plant species intendedby using relative popularity level (RPL) and rank order priority (ROP) indices.Ethnobotanical data were collected by interviewing 166 local informants and 35 traditional health practioners (THPs) from different localities of Hafizabad district. Demographic features of informants; life form, part used, methods of preparation, modes of application and ethnomedicinal uses were documented. Ethnobotanical data were analyzed using quantitative tools, i.e. Relative frequency citation (RFC), use value (UV), informant consensus factor (ICF) fidelity level (FL), RPL and ROP indices. A total of 85 species belonging to 71 genera and 34 families were documented along with ethnomedicinal uses. Solanum surattense, Withania somnifera, Cyperus rotundus, Solanum nigrum and Melia azedarach were the most utilized medicinal plant species with highest used value. The reported ailments were classified into 11 disease categories based on ICF values and highest number of plant species was reported to treat dermatological and gastrointestinal disorders. Withania somnifera and Ranunculus sceleratus with maximum FL (100%), were used against gastrointestinal and urinary disorders, respectively. The RPL and ROP values were calculated to recognize the folk medicinal plant wealth; six out of 32 plant species (19%) were found popular, based on citation by more than half of the maximum number of informant viz. 26. Consequently, the ROP value for these species was more than 75. The comparative assessment with reported literature revealed 15% resemblance and 6% variation to previous data;however79% uses of the reported species were recorded for the first time. The diversity of medicinal plant species and associated traditional knowledge is significant in primary health care system. Medicinal plant species with high RPL values should be screened for comprehensive phytochemical and pharmacological studies. This could be useful in novel drug discovery and to validate the ethomendicinal knowledge.">

Hence, the aim of this work was to contribute to the fight against helminths of medical and veterinary importance in general, and also to clear the environment of their free living stages.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Fresh eggs of Heligmosomoides bakeri were obtained from the faeces of experimentally infected mice. L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; larval stages were obtained after 48 and 72 h of coproculture respectively. Methylene Chloride-Methanol (1:1) extracts of Annona senegalensis and Nauclea latifolia were diluted in DMSO or Tween 80 to prepare the following concentrations: 625, 1250, 2500, 3750 and 5000 μg/ml. The effects of extract solutions were evaluated on the embryonation of eggs, egg hatching and on L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; survival after 48, 10 and 24 h of incubation. Negative controls were 1.5% DMSO, 4% Tween 80 and a mixture of these solvents. The TLC was carried out and the profiles of secondary metabolites were made.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Negative controls had no effect on the embryonation, eggs hatching and on larval mortality. However, it was found that, the extracts affected the free living stages of H. bakeri in a concentration-dependant manner. At the highest concentration (5000 μg/ml), the rate of inhibition of embryonation obtained were 20.80%, 38.15% and 84.83% for Methylene Chloride-Methanol of Annona senegalensis (MCM As), Nauclea latifolia (MCM Nl) extracts and mixture of Annona senegalensis and Nauclea latifolia (MCM As-Nl) extract respectively. For egg hatch, the inhibition rate was 16.10%, 46.24% and 87.07% for the above three extracts respectively at the same concentration of 5000 μg/ml. On L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; larval stages after 24 h of exposure to extracts, the mortality rates of 100%, 54.76% and 96.77% against 98%, 51.44% and 100% were obtained for MCM As, MCM Nl and MCM As-Nl respectively at the highest concentration. The Methylene Chloride-Methanol of A.senegalensis, N. latifolia extracts showed the presence of alkaloids except in N. latifolia extract, flavonoids, sterols, triterpens, tanins, polyphenols, anthraquinons, saponins and terpenoids.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;These findings suggest that, the mixture of the two plant extracts showed an additive (synergetic effect) ovicidal effect and a slight larval mortality on L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; as compared to the effect of MCM As extract alone. These effects were due to the presence ao secondary metabolites identifies in the plant extracts. Thus, they may be used as possible «disinfectants» for soil transmitted nematodes.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Onchocerciasis is one of the tropical neglected diseases (NTDs) caused by the nematode Onchocerca volvulus. Control strategies currently in use rely on mass administration of ivermectin, which has marked activity against microfilariae. Furthermore, the development of resistance to ivermectin was observed. Since vaccine and safe macrofilaricidal treatment against onchocerciasis are still lacking, there is an urgent need to discover novel drugs. This study was undertaken to investigate the anthelmintic activity of Lophira lanceolata on the cattle parasite Onchocerca ochengi and the anthelmintic drug resistant strains of the free living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and to determine the phytochemical profiles of the extracts and fractions of the plants.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Plant was extracted in ethanol or methanol-methylene chloride. O. ochengi, C. elegans wild-type and C. elegans drug resistant strains were cultured in RPMI-1640 and NGM-agar respectively. Drugs diluted in dimethylsulphoxide/RPMI or M9-Buffer were added in assays and monitored at 48 h and 72 h. Worm viability was determined by using the MTT/formazan colorimetric method. Polyphenol, tannin and flavonoid contents were determined by dosage of gallic acid and rutin. Acute oral toxicity was evaluated using Swiss albino mice.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Ethanolic and methanolic-methylene chloride extracts killed O. ochengi with LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 9.76, 8.05, 6.39 μg/mL and 9.45, 7.95, 6.39 μg/mL respectively for leaves, trunk bark and root bark after 72 h. The lowest concentrations required to kill 50% of the wild-type of C. elegans were 1200 and 1890 μg/mL with ethanolic crude extract, 1000 and 2030 μg/mL with MeOH-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for root bark and trunk bark of L. lanceolata, respectively after 72 h. Leave extracts of L. lanceolata are lethal to albendazole and ivermectin resistant strains of C. elegans after 72 h. Methanol/methylene chloride extracted more metabolites. Additionally, extracts could be considered relatively safe.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Ethanolic and methanolic-methylene chloride crude extracts and fractions of L. lanceolata showed in vitro anthelmintic activity. The extracts and fractions contained polyphenols, tannins, flavonoids and saponins. The mechanism of action of this plant could be different from that of albendazole and ivermectin. These results confirm the use of L. lanceolata by traditional healers for the treatment of worm infections.">

This study explored some medicinal herbs used by HIV-positive people in Lesotho and the reasons for their use.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;This was a cross sectional study based on a questionnaire distributed to purposively-sampled HIV-positive people in Leribe and Maseru districts of Lesotho. The participants' socio-demographic and clinical variables were summarized using frequency tables in Stata version 13 statistical software. Data variables for medicinal herbs used, frequency of use, uses by the participants and in the literature, parts of plants used and the method of preparation were also explored.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Out of 400 questionnaires distributed to the participants, 389 were returned with data acceptable for analysis. Ages of the participants ranged from 18 to 75 years (Mean=43 + 11.6). Out of the 272 (69.9%) participants who conceded that they had used medicinal herbs at least once, 30 (7.7%) participants used medicinal herbs frequently while 242 (62.2 %) rarely used the herbs. At least 20 plant species belonging to 16 families were reportedly used by the participants. Asteraceae was the most common plant family reportedly used by the participants. &lt;i&gt;Allium sativum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dicoma anomala&lt;/i&gt;, reportedly used by 21.0% and 14.3% respectively, were the most commonly used medicinal herbs in this population. In addition, boosting the immune system and treating gastrointestinal ailments, apparently cited by 32% and 28% participants respectively, were the most commonly reported reasons for using medicinal herbs.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;A considerable proportion (69.9%) of HIV-positive people use medicinal herbs in this population, and 7.7% use them frequently. At least 20 plant species belonging to 16 families were reportedly used by the participants. HIV counselling protocols in Lesotho should emphasize the dangers of using medicinal herbs whose safety and compatibility with antiretroviral drugs is not known. The efficacy and toxicity profiles of the medicinal plants identified in this study need to be investigated. Furthermore, the effects of these plants on antiretroviral treatment outcomes including herb-drug interactions need to be explored.">

        <span class="abst" title="Objective:The main aim of this scientific report was to investigate a series of phytochemicals in silico and the pharmacology of four plants found at higher altitude in the ginger family, Zingiberaceae (incl. Costaceae) from North-East India, particularly Sikkim. First, the goal was to determine the biological activities of the four herbs (used under Zingiberaceae family) using antioxidant assays to identify the best species. Second, previously reported compounds in litero were subsequently screened for their anticancerous activities using in silico methods. Materials and Methods:Using the methanolic extracts of herbs, quantitative detection of phytochemicals such as total phenols and total flavonoids was detected, and the free radical scavenging activity was also studied using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) assay. Docking process was studied, using Discovery Studio version 3.5, to identify suitable molecules at the protein-binding sites through annealing and genetic simulation algorithms. Grids centered on active sites were obtained with spacing of 54 × 55 × 56, and 0.503 grid spacing was calculated. The methods adopted and used in this study were comparisons of Global and Local Search Methods to determine the parameters such as maximum number of 250,000 energy evaluations as well as generations of 27,000, followed by mutation and crossover rates of 0.02 and 0.80. The number of docking runs was set to 10. Molecular dynamics study was done to check the stability of the complex. Results:Among all the genus of Zingiberaceae family investigated in this study, Curcuma angustifolia and Hedychium sp. exhibited the highest 537 ± 12.45; 292 ± 9.16 mg gallic acid equivalent/g total polyphenols and 38 ± 1.54; 75 ± 6.75 mg quercetin equivalent/g flavonoids, respectively. Depending on the concentration, the Hedychium sp. extract exerted the highest scavenging activity on DPPH radical (IC50 36.4 μg/mL). In silico result demonstrated that the synergetic effects of β-phellandrene with other compounds might be responsible for its anticancerous activity. β-phellandrene and farnesene epoxide showed bonding with Leu298, Ala302, Met336, Leu339, Leu343, Phe356, Ala302, Glu305, Met340, Leu343, Arg346, Phe356, Ile373, Ile376, Leu380, His475, Leu476, and Leu491. Conclusion:Based on the current available literature, this is the first study to understand the interaction of compounds found in the rhizomes of Zingiberaceae family. SUMMARY:The aqueous methanolic extract of Zingiberaceae family Curcuma angustifolia and Hedychium sp. has potent antioxidant activity as assessed by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl assaysHedychium sp. is understood to possess more active compounds than other varietiesIn silico studies indicated synergetic effects of β-phellandrene and other compounds for its anticancerous activity.

        <span class="abst" title="Gastrointestinal nematodes are a major threat to small ruminant rearing in the Sahel area, where farmers traditionally use bioactive plants to control these worms, including Acacia nilotica and Acacia raddiana. The main aim of this study was to screen the potential anthelmintic properties of aqueous and acetone extracts of leaves of these two plants based on three in vitro assays: (1) the egg hatch inhibition assay (EHA); (2) the larvae exsheathment inhibition assay (LEIA) using Haemonchus contortus as a model; and (3) an adult mortality test (AMT) applied on Caenorhabditis elegans. For the EHA, only A. raddiana was effective with IC50 = 1.58 mg/mL for aqueous extract, and IC50 = 0.58 mg/mL for acetonic extract. For the LEIA, all extracts inhibited the exsheathment of larvae compared to the controls, and the aqueous extract of A. nilotica was more larvicidal with IC50 = 0.195 mg/mL. In general, all responses to the substances were dose-dependent and were significantly different from the control group (p &lt; 0.05). For the AMT, the extracts of the two Acacia species were effective but A. raddiana showed greater efficacy with 100% mortality at 2.5 mg/mL and LC50 = 0.84 mg/mL (acetonic extract). The addition of polyvinyl polypyrrolidone (PVPP) to the extracts suggested that tannins were responsible for blocking egg eclosion and inducing adult mortality but were not responsible for exsheathment inhibition. These results suggest that the leaves of these Acacia species possess ovicidal and larvicidal activities in vitro against H. contortus, and adulticidal effects against C. elegans.">

        <span class="abst" title="Gastrointestinal nematodes are a significant concern for animal health and well-being, and anthelmintic treatment is mainly performed through the use of chemical products. However, bioactive compounds produced by plants have shown promise for development as novel anthelmintics. The aim of this study is to assess the anthelmintic activity of protein fractions from Spigelia anthelmia on the gastrointestinal nematode Haemonchus contortus. Plant parts were separated into leaves, stems and roots, washed with distilled water, freeze-dried and ground into a fine powder. Protein extraction was performed with sodium phosphate buffer (75 mM, pH 7.0). The extract was fractionated using ammonium sulfate (0-90%) and extensively dialyzed. The resulting fractions were named LPF (leaf protein fraction), SPF (stem protein fraction) and RPF (root protein fraction), and the protein contents and activities of the fractions were analyzed. H. contortus egg hatching (EHA), larval exsheathment inhibition (LEIA) and larval migration inhibition (LMIA) assays were performed. Proteomic analysis was conducted, and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) chromatographic profiles of the fractions were established to identify proteins and possible secondary metabolites. S. anthelmia fractions inhibited H. contortus egg hatching, with LPF having the most potent effects (EC50 0.17 mg mL-1). During LEIA, SPF presented greater efficiency than the other fractions (EC50 0.25 mg mL-1). According to LMIA, the fractions from roots, stems and leaves also reduced the number of larvae, with EC50 values of 0.11, 0.14 and 0.21 mg mL-1, respectively. Protein analysis indicated the presence of plant defense proteins in the S. anthelmia fractions, including protease, protease inhibitor, chitinase and others. Conversely, secondary metabolites were absent in the S. anthemia fractions. These results suggest that S. anthelmia proteins are promising for the control of the gastrointestinal nematode H. contortus.">

        <span class="abst" title="Plant-derived products have an imperative biological role against certain pathogenic organisms and were considered to be a major source of modern drugs. Rural people residing in developing countries are relying on traditional herbal medical system due to their strong believe and minimum access to allopathic medicines. Hence, ethnomedicinal knowledge is useful for the maintenance of community's based approaches under this medical system. Present study was carried out in an unexplored remote tribal area of Pakistan to investigate and document the existing ethnomedicinal knowledge on local flora.Data was collected through semi-structured questionnaires from the community members and local herbalists. Use reports (URs) were counted for each species and analyzed through Linear Regression between the number of URs per family and number of plant species per family.A total of 64 medicinal plant species were recorded belonging to 60 genera and 41 families. Most frequently used plant families in ethnomedicines were Lamiaceae (8 species) and Asteraceae (7 species). Highest URs were recorded for Caralluma tuberculata N.E. Br. (49 URs) being followed by Thymus serphyllum L. (49 URs), Fagonia cretica L. (47 URs), Plantago lanceolata L. (45 URs), Periploca aphylla Decne. (44 URs), Citrullus colocynthis (L.) Schrad. (44 URs), and Sideroxylon mascatense (A.DC.) T.D.Penn. (44 URs). New ethnomedicinal uses were reported for Boerhaavia elongata Brandegee and Fumaria officinalis L. with confidential level of URs from the study area. Nineteen groups of health conditions were recorded during the course of study being treated with medicinal plants. Maximum number of 30 plant species was used to treat digestive problems. Most widely practiced mode of drugs' preparation and administration was powder. Leaves (30% plants) were the most frequently used plant parts in the preparation of ethnomedicinal recipes.Current study is an important addition to the field of ethnomedicines. The study reports important medicinal plants from an area, which has not been investigated previously. Traditional knowledge is restricted to health practitioners and elder community members. This knowledge is at the verge of extinction because younger generation is not taking interest in its learning and preservation process. Hence, there is a dire need to phytochemically and pharmacologically test the investigated taxa for the validation of traditional knowledge.">

Floristic composition of modern vegetation analysis at different habitats revealed four community types and nine associated types, providing an indicator of high soil salinity and moisture content. Cereal and Achillea-type pollen were common in the mudbrick samples, indicating the probable use of these plants as temper during mudbrick manufacturing in the Middle and New Kingdoms. The kitchen samples were dominated by cereals, broad bean, celery, and other weed pollen types, indicating the importance of cereals, legumes, and celery as strategic crops for food or medicines during the Middle Kingdom period. Weed pollen types were probably associated with crops, with &quot;Cheno-am&quot; pollen type recorded at highest abundance in the tomb filling jar, which may indicate the use of these aromatic herbs to repel insects and animals from tombs.">

        <span class="abst" title="Aim:Haemonchus contortus is a major problem in small ruminants in Indonesia. The frequent use of the anthelmintic drugs has given rise to drug-resistant populations which increase the need for new anthelminthic compounds, particularly from endemic plants. This study evaluated the in vitro effects of Biophytum petersianum crude aqueous extract (BAE) as an anthelmintic compound against H. contortus adult worm isolated from goats. Materials and Methods:Adult worm collected from naturally infected abomasums were obtained from slaughtered goats on the day of slaughter. BAE was prepared in six different concentrations (10, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 mg/ml) which were tested for their efficacies on ten actively moving worms. Ivermectin (1 mg/ml) was included as a reference drug, while saline water was included as a control. The dead worms from anthelmintic test then went through sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results:Highest mean mortality in treatments group both at 2 h and 4 h observations was BAE 10%. The SDS-PAGE analysis revealed the presence of five protein bands with molecular weights 9.3, 17.1, 50.0, 63.2, and 72.7 kDa based on BAE 10%. The SEM changes observed in the in vitro trials revealed the occurrence of interactions between the BAE and the cuticle. Conclusion:The SEM and SDS-PAGE analysis revealed ultrastructural structural changes and the decrease numbers of polypeptides on treated worms when compared to the control worms. It can thus be concluded that the BAE exhibits good anthelmintic activity against H. contortus adult worm.">

        <span class="abst" title="Maytenus senegalensis is a common shrub which is scattered in tropical Africa. Different parts of this plant have been reported to be useful in traditional medicine against gastrointestinal disorders and intestinal worms. This study evaluated the anthelmintic activity of the aqueous stem bark extract of M. senegalensis using egg hatch assay (EHA), larval migration inhibition assay (LMIA) and adult worms' motility inhibition assay (AMIA).On EHA, the extract concentrations tested resulted in a significant (p &lt; 0.01) inhibition of egg hatching in concentration-dependent manner and ranged between 31.86% at 75 μg.mL- 1 to 54.92% at 2400 μg.mL- 1 after a 48 h post-exposure with eggs. For the LMI assays, the aqueous extract of M. senegalensis showed a significant (p &lt; 0.05) inhibition of larval migration in a concentration-dependent manner. The highest concentration used (2400 μg.mL- 1) showed a 37.77% inhibition. The use of polyvinyl polypyrrolidone (PVPP) indicated that tannins and flavonoids were partly involved in the effect since the larval migration was inhibited by 15.5%, but other biochemical compounds were also implicated. On AMIA, M. senegalensis was associated with a reduced worm motility after a 24 h post exposure compared to phosphate buffered saline as control (p &lt; 0.05). By this time 66.66% of the worms' were found immotile or dead in the wells containing plant extract at 2400 μg.mL- 1. The Phytochemical analysis of aqueous extract of M. senegalensis by HPLC-ESI-MSn detected the presence of proanthocyanidins (20%) and flavonoids (&gt; 50%).These in vitro results suggest the presence of some anthelmintic properties in M. senegalensis extract, which is traditionally used by small farmers in west and central Africa. These effects may be due to the flavonoids and proanthocyanidins present in the extract and need to be studied under in vivo conditions.">

        <span class="abst" title="South Africa has a long history and strong belief in traditional herbal medicines. Using ethnobotanical knowledge as a lead, a large number of South African medicinal plants have been discovered to possess a wide spectrum of pharmacological properties. In this review, bioprospecting of endophytes is highlighted by following the advantages of the ethnomedicinal approach together with identifying unique medicinal plants where biological activity may be due to endophytes. This review focuses on the current status of South African medicinal plants to motivate the research community to harness the benefits of ethnobotanical knowledge to investigate the presence of endophytic microbes from the most potent South African medicinal plants. The potential chemical diversity and subsequent putative medicinal value of endophytes is deserving of further research. A timely and comprehensive review of literature on recently isolated endophytes and their metabolites was conducted. Worldwide literature from the last 2 years demonstrating the importance of ethnobotanical knowledge as a useful approach to discover endophytic microbes was documented. Information was obtained from scientific databases such as Pubmed, Scopus, Scirus, Google Scholar, Dictionary of Natural Products, Chemical Abstracts Services, official websites, and scientific databases on ethnomedicines. Primary sources such as books, reports, dissertations, and thesises were accessed where available. Recently published information on isolated endophytes with promising bioactivity and their bioactive natural products worldwide (2015-2017) was summarized. The potential value of South African medicinal plants as sources of endophytes is discussed. The insights provided through this study indicate that medicinal plants in South Africa are highly under-investigated sources of potentially useful endophytic microbes. New approaches may be used by medicinal plant scientists for further exploration of natural products from endophytic fungi and bacteria in southern Africa.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Liver fluke infection caused by the parasite Fasciola hepatica is a major cause of production losses to the cattle industry in the UK. To investigate farm-level risk factors for fluke infection, a randomised method to recruit an appropriate number of herds from a defined geographical area into the study was required. The approach and hurdles that were encountered in designing and implementing this study are described. The county of Shropshire, England, was selected for the study because of the variation between farms in exposure to fluke infection observed in an earlier study. RESULTS:From a sampling list of 569 holdings in Shropshire randomly drawn from the RADAR cattle population dataset, 396 (69.6%) holdings were successfully contacted by telephone and asked if they would be interested in taking part in the study. Of 296 farmers who agreed to receive information packs by post, 195 (65.9%) agreed to take part in the study. Over the period October 2014 - April 2015 visits were made to 100 dairy and 95 non-dairy herds. During the farm visits 40 faecal samples +/- bulk-tank milk samples were collected and a questionnaire administered. Composite faecal samples were analysed for the presence of F. hepatica eggs by sedimentation and bulk tank milk samples were tested with an antibody ELISA for F. hepatica. Forty-five (49%) of non-dairy herds were positive for liver fluke infection as determined by the finding of one or more fluke eggs, while 36 (36%) dairy herds had fluke positive faecal samples and 41 (41%) dairy herds were positive for F. hepatica antibody. Eighty-seven (45.8%) farmers said that they monitored their cattle for liver fluke infection and 118 (62.1%) reported that they used flukicide drugs in their cattle. CONCLUSIONS:Using a protocol of contacting farmers directly by telephone and subsequently sending information by post, 79% of the target sample size was successfully recruited into the study. A dataset of farm-specific information on possible risk factors for liver fluke infection and corresponding liver-fluke infection status was generated for the development of statistical models to identify risk factors for liver fluke infection at the farm-level.">

Found throughout a wide range of taxa, this broad and functionally important family can be subclassified into distinct groups dependent upon their number and type of cystine bonding patters, tertiary structures, and/or their species of origin. Furthermore, the annotation of proteins related to the cystine-stabilized family are under-represented in the literature due to their difficulty of isolation and identification. As a result, there are several recent attempts to collate them into data resources and build analytic tools for their dynamic prediction. Ultimately, the identification and delivery of new members of this family will lead to their growing inclusion into the repertoire of commercial viable alternatives to antibiotics and environmentally safe insecticides. This review of the literature and current state of cystine-stabilized peptide biology is aimed to better describe peptide subfamilies, identify databases and analytics resources associated with specific cystine-stabilized peptides, and highlight their current commercial success.">

The screening of medicinal plants used locally for the treatment of infectious diseases, can provide a reliable option in the discovery of potent therapeutic compounds. This study was carried out to investigate the antiviral activities of 27 medicinal plant extracts, belonging to 26 different plant species, selected from Nigerian ethnobotany, against echovirus 7, 13 and 19 serotypes (E7, E13 and E19, respectively).&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The plants were macerated in methanol and the cytotoxicities of the crude extracts were evaluated on the rhabdomyosarcoma cell line using the MTT assay. The antiviral activity of the plant extracts and fractions against echoviruses (E7, E13, and E19) was determined using the neutralisation assay, an assay that measures the inhibition of cytopathic effect on cell culture.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The crude extract of Macaranga barteri leaves had the highest cytotoxicity with CC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 0.27 μg/mL. This was followed by Crinum jagus (9.88 μg/mL) and Terminalia ivorensis (12.14 μg/mL). The antiviral screening showed that ten out of the 27 crude plant extracts tested were active on E7 and E19, inhibiting the cytopathic effect of the virus in tissue culture. None of the extracts inhibited the cytopathic effect caused by E13 serotype. Amongst the active plant extracts, the methanol extract of M. barteri leaves had the highest antiviral activity on both E7 and E9 with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 0.028 and 0.0017 ng/mL, respectively, followed by the Ageratum conyzoides extract (0.208 μg/mL, E7; 0.006 μg/mL, E19) and Mondia whitei extract (0.038 μg/mL, E7; 0.005 μg/mL, E19). Amongst the fractions of M. barteri, the DCM fraction was most the active and selective on E7 (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.0075 ng/mL; SI = 19,896.54) and E19 (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.0175 ng/mL; SI = 8581.24).&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Our research has demonstrated that Macaranga barteri extracts has potent antiviral activity against echoviruses E7 and E19, and our findings suggest that this extract may have potential as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of enteroviral infections.">

Water-based decoctions of chórta are widely consumed in Greek alternative medicine as health promoting agents. This study examined the chemical profile of the decoctions of eight edible plants, &lt;i&gt;Cichorium intybus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;C. endivia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;C. spinosum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Crepis sancta&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sonchus asper&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Carthamus lanatus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Centaurea raphanina&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Amaranthus blitum&lt;/i&gt;, by UPLC-ESI-HRMS and HRMS/MS analysis, to determine possibly bioactive constituents. The profiles of the plants from the Asteraceae family are dominated by the presence of phenolic acids and flavonoid derivatives, whereas the &lt;i&gt;A. blitum&lt;/i&gt; decoction is rich in triterpene saponins. Interestingly, the &lt;i&gt;Centaurea raphanina&lt;/i&gt; decoction was found to be extremely rich in flavanones, particularly in the aglycone pinocembrin. Further phytochemical investigation and fractionation of this extract resulted in the isolation and identification of five compounds: phlorin (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), syringin (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), pinocembrin (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), pinocembroside (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), and pinocembrin-7-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-neohesperidoside (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;). The extracts were also tested for their antioxidant and differential cytotoxic activity against tumor cells. &lt;i&gt;C. raphanina&lt;/i&gt; was found to be differentially toxic against metastatic tumor cells. In conclusion, we found that Greek edible greens are a rich source of bioactive secondary metabolites and their consumption could contribute to the maintenance of overall health.">

        <span class="abst" title="This study investigated the overall prevalence of &lt;i&gt;Haemonchus contortus&lt;/i&gt; infection in sheep and goats from five purposively selected subdivisions (sectors) of Nyagatare district from January to December 2014, after a high prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites and generalized poor productivity was reported in small ruminants in some districts of Rwanda. Faecal egg counts (FEC) were performed using the Modified Wisconsin Sugar Floatation method and the Fluorescent-labeled peanut-lectin agglutination test while enumerations, as log (FEC), were done using the modified McMaster method. The overall prevalence of &lt;i&gt;H. contortus&lt;/i&gt; infection in sheep and goats was 75.7% (n=949). The overall prevalence of &lt;i&gt;H. contortus&lt;/i&gt; infection in sheep (83.4%, n=314) was higher than in goats (71.8%, n=635) (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.98, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.40-2.79, and p≤0.001). The prevalence of &lt;i&gt;H. contortus&lt;/i&gt; infection in female goats (74.2%) was higher than in male goats (64.3%) (OR 1.60, 95% CI: 1.09-2.36, and p=0.01). The prevalence of &lt;i&gt;H. contortus&lt;/i&gt; infection in goats from Nyagatare was higher than in goats from Matimba (OR 3.25, 95% CI: 1.76-5.99, and p≤0.001) and from Katabagemu (OR 3.67, 95% CI: 2.04-6.59, and p≤0.001). The prevalence of &lt;i&gt;H. contortus&lt;/i&gt; infection in goats from Karangazi was higher than in goats from Matimba (OR 4.72, 95% CI: 2.40-9.28, and p≤0.001). The overall mean monthly log (FEC) for &lt;i&gt;H. contortus&lt;/i&gt; in sheep and goats were highest in April (18.9±0.2 and 14.05±0.1, respectively) and October (19.25± 0.2 and 13.75±0.1, respectively). Though, overall, sheep in Nyagatare district were at greater risk of &lt;i&gt;H. contortus&lt;/i&gt; infection and goats from Nyagatare and Karangazi sectors were paradoxically at greater risk of &lt;i&gt;H. contortus&lt;/i&gt; infection. It was also apparent that young female goats were at greater risk of &lt;i&gt;H. contortus&lt;/i&gt; infection than young male goats. &lt;i&gt;H. contortus&lt;/i&gt; infection is endemic in small ruminants in Nyagatare district and possibly other districts in Rwanda. Targeted selective treatment (TST) using FAMACHA with emphasis on low-lying swampy pastures and appropriate anthelmintic drugs may be the most economically viable solution in the short term. In the long term breeding of &lt;i&gt;H. contortus&lt;/i&gt; resistant small ruminants and strategic grazing using the concept of refugia may bring about considerable relief from &lt;i&gt;H. contortus&lt;/i&gt; infection in Nyagatare district, in particular, and Rwanda at large.">

Although these interactions are often associated with unwanted effects such as adverse events or inefficacy, they can also produce effects that are potentially beneficial to the patient. Beneficial pharmacokinetic interactions include the improvement of the bioavailability of a drug (i.e., by enhancing absorption and/or inhibiting metabolism) or prolongation of a drug's plasma level within its therapeutic window (i.e., by decreasing excretion), whereas beneficial pharmacodynamic interactions include additive or synergistic effects. Mechanisms by which pharmacokinetic interactions can cause beneficial effects include enhancement of membrane permeation (e.g., structural changes in the epithelial cell membranes or opening of tight junctions), modulation of carrier proteins (e.g., inhibition of efflux transporters and stimulation of uptake transporters) and inhibition of metabolic enzymes. In the current review, selected pharmacokinetic interactions between drugs and various compounds from different sources including food, herb, dietary supplements and selected drugs are discussed. These interactions may be exploited in the future to the benefit of the patient, for example, by delivering drugs that are poorly bioavailable in therapeutic levels via alternative routes of administration than parenteral injection.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Opuntia ficus-indica&lt;/i&gt; (L.) Mill. is a xerophylous plant that originated in tropical and subtropical America. This plant is popularly known in Brazil as &quot;palma forrageira&quot; (cactus pear) and plays a fundamental role in animal nutrition, mainly in the Northeastern semi-arid region of the country. The plant has several uses since it presents bioactive compounds that confer biological and pharmacological properties. In this context, the cactus pear can also be considered a potential product to combat parasite infections. The objective of this study was to chemically characterize the &lt;i&gt;O. ficus-indica&lt;/i&gt; hydroalcoholic extract (OFIEOH) and to determine its efficacy against gastrointestinal parasites using in vitro tests. Initially, the hydroalcoholic extract from cladode peels of &lt;i&gt;O. ficus-indica&lt;/i&gt; was produced by maceration for 21 days. For the chemical characterization, colorimetric dosages were performed for carbohydrates, proteins, phenols and condensed tannins. Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry/electron spray ionization (LC-MS/ESI) was used to characterize the polyphenolic profile of the OFIEOH extract. Fifteen compounds were identified in the OFIEOH extract, such as methyl, glycosylated and aglycone quercetin derivatives and aglycone and glycosylated kaempferol derivatives. Tri-glycosylated methyl quercetin derivatives were the main compounds identified. In vitro egg hatch (EHT) and larval migration tests (LMT) were used in a range of concentrations of OFIEOH from 12.5 to 100 mg/mL for EHT and 12.5 to 200 mg/mL for LMT. In addition, the LMT was used to test ivermectin (IVM) (from 11.4 to 57.1 µM), associated with the inhibitory concentration of 50% (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) for OFIEOH. The combination of OFIEOH (12.5 to 200 mg/mL) plus the IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of IVM was also tested. The efficacy of OFIEOH alone varied from 19.33 to 90.0% using the EHT. The LMT revealed an efficacy of 5.78 to 77.26% for the extract. Both tests showed a concentration-dependence inhibitory effect. We found a drug-extract antagonistic neutralizing effect when doses of IVM were added to OFIEOH (maximum efficacy of 73.78%), while a positive additive effect was observed when OFIEOH was added to the IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of IVM (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 82.79 for OFIEOH alone against an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 55.08 of OFIEOH + IVM). The data from this work indicate that OFIEOH alone may be considered as a suitable ecofriendly product to control gastrointestinal parasites of sheep, offering a more holistic approach to improve animal farming and welfare. The drug-extract interaction is also a promising therapeutic alternative, reducing the final dose to the host, with an optimum combination effect.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Functional analysis of animal parasitic nematode genes is often quite challenging due to the unavailability of standardised in vitro culture conditions and lack of adequate tools to manipulate these genes. Therefore, this study was undertaken to investigate the suitability of Culex quinquefasciatus, as an in vivo culture platform for Setaria digitata larvae and RNA interference (RNAi), as a post-transcriptional gene silencing tool to study the roles of a vital gene that encodes a novel parasitic nematode-specific protein (SDNP).&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The red colour fluorescence detected following RNAi injection to the thorax of C. quinquefasciatus indicated the uptake of dsRNA by S. digitata larvae. The reduction of SDNP transcripts in siRNA treated larvae compared to non-treated larvae, as determined by qPCR, indicated that the siRNA pathway is operational in S. digitata larvae. The observation of motility reductions and deformities during the development indicated the association of SDNP in larvae locomotion and development processes, respectively. The irregularities in the migration of larvae in mosquitoes and elevated survival rates of mosquitoes compared to their untreated counterparts indicated reduced parasitism of S. digitata larvae in mosquitoes upon targeted downregulation of SDNP by siRNA treatment.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;SDNP plays vital roles in muscle contraction, locomotion, development processes, larval development and parasitism of S. digitata. Its ubiquitous presence in parasitic nematodes and its absence in their hosts provide a tantalising prospect of the possibility of targeting SDNP for future development of anthelmintic drugs. The susceptibility of the larval stages of S. digitata for RNAi in Culex quinquefasciatus was also demonstrated for the first time in this study.">

        <span class="abst" title="A recent accumulation of studies has demonstrated that nongenetic, maternally transmitted factors are often critical to the health and development of offspring and can therefore play a role in ecological and evolutionary processes. In particular, microorganisms such as bacteria have been championed as heritable, symbiotic partners capable of conferring fitness benefits to their hosts. At the same time, parents may also pass various nonmicrobial organisms to their offspring, yet the roles of such organisms in shaping the developmental environment of their hosts remain largely unexplored. Here, we show that the nematode &lt;i&gt;Diplogastrellus monhysteroides&lt;/i&gt; is transgenerationally inherited and sexually transmitted by the dung beetle &lt;i&gt;Onthophagus taurus&lt;/i&gt; By manipulating artificial chambers in which beetle offspring develop, we demonstrate that the presence of &lt;i&gt;D. monhysteroides&lt;/i&gt; nematodes enhances the growth of beetle offspring, empirically challenging the paradigm that nematodes are merely commensal or even detrimental to their insect hosts. Finally, our research presents a compelling mechanism whereby the nematodes influence the health of beetle larvae: &lt;i&gt;D. monhysteroides&lt;/i&gt; nematodes engineer the bacterial and fungal communities that also inhabit the beetle developmental chambers, including specific taxa known to be involved in biomass degradation, possibly allowing larval beetles better access to their otherwise recalcitrant, plant-based diet. Thus, our findings illustrate that nongenetic inheritance can include intermediately sized organisms that live and proliferate in close association with, and in certain cases enhance, the development of their hosts' offspring.">

        <span class="abst" title="Gastrointestinal (GI) parasitic infection is a serious issue in cattle management. The effects of GI parasites may vary with age, sex of cattle, nutritional condition, and severity of infection. Prevalence of GI parasites among cattle population in Gampaha District has not been studied and there is no published study available. A total of 45 farms rearing cattle were selected randomly in three areas, namely, Kelaniya, Ganemulla, and Welisara, under three Veterinary Surgeon Divisions (VSD) in Gampaha District (Mahara, Gampaha, and Welisara). Freshly voided cattle fecal samples were collected randomly from the selected farms during March 2017-December 2017. Out of 163 cattle and buffaloes examined, 13.39% (n=22) were positive for eggs of one or more species of GI parasites. The prevalence of parasitic infection was higher in buffaloes (31.25%, 5/16) as compared to that of cows (11.56%, 21/147), but the difference was not significant (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &gt;0.05). Hookworms (&lt;i&gt;Bunostomum&lt;/i&gt; spp.), whipworms (&lt;i&gt;Trichuris&lt;/i&gt; spp.), digenetic trematodes (&lt;i&gt;Paramphistomum&lt;/i&gt; spp.), cestodes (&lt;i&gt;Moniezia&lt;/i&gt; spp.), and oocysts of protozoans (coccidians) were found during the study. The nontreated animals indicated the highest percentage of parasitic infections accounting for 46.67% (n= 14), followed by partially treated individuals (15.15%, n= 5). GI parasite prevalence in males was higher when compared to that of females, but the difference was nonsignificant (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &gt;0.05). General Linear Modelling (GLM) revealed that the effect of treatment status was significantly associated with the prevalence of GI parasites. The calves and yearlings had the highest rate of GI parasitic infections. The highest infection rate was observed at Kelaniya, followed by Welisara. Future investigations are necessary to evaluate the economic impact of GI parasites in the study areas.">

The problem of drug resistance necessitates the need for alternative novel therapeutic strategies to combat this menace. One such approach is targeting the quorum-sensing (QS) controlled virulence and biofilm formation. In this study, we first screened different fractions of &lt;i&gt;Psoralea corylifolia&lt;/i&gt; (seed) for their anti-QS property in the &lt;i&gt;Chromobacterium violaceum&lt;/i&gt; 12472 strain. The methanol fraction was found to be the most active fraction and was selected for further bioassays. At sub-inhibitory concentrations, the &lt;i&gt;P. corylifolia&lt;/i&gt; methanol fraction (PCMF) reduced QS-regulated virulence functions in &lt;i&gt;C. violaceum&lt;/i&gt; CVO26 (violacein); &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; (elastase, protease, pyocyanin, chitinase, exopolysaccharides (EPS), and swarming motility), &lt;i&gt;A. hydrophila&lt;/i&gt; (protease, EPS), and &lt;i&gt;Serratia marcescens&lt;/i&gt; (prodigiosin). Biofilm formation in all the test pathogens was reduced significantly (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≤ 0.005) in a concentration-dependent manner. The β-galactosidase assay showed that the PCMF at 1,000 μg/ml downregulated &lt;i&gt;las&lt;/i&gt;-controlled transcription in PAO1. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies with &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; demonstrated increased survival of the nematodes after treatment with the PCMF. Bakuchiol, a phytoconstituent of the extract, demonstrated significant inhibition of QS-regulated violacein production in &lt;i&gt;C. violaceum&lt;/i&gt; and impaired biofilm formation in the test pathogens. The molecular docking results suggested that bakuchiol efficiently binds to the active pockets of LasR and RhlR, and the complexes were stabilized by several hydrophobic interactions. Additionally, the molecular dynamics simulation of LasR, LasR-bakuchiol, RhlR, and RhlR-bakuchiol complexes for 50 ns revealed that the binding of bakuchiol to LasR and RhlR was fairly stable. The study highlights the anti-infective potential of the PCMF and bakuchiol instead of bactericidal or bacteriostatic action, as the extract targets QS-controlled virulence and the biofilm.">

The overview starts from the antique age of the Mediterranean area with ancient Egypt, followed by the Greek and Roman classic period. Then, the ancient oriental civilizations of China and India are evaluated. More recently, Unani medicine and European folk medicine are examined. Finally, the African and American folk medicines are taken into consideration. In conclusion, a list of RIP-expressing plants, which have been used in folk medicine, is provided with the geographical distribution and the prescriptions that are recommended by traditional healers. Some final considerations are provided on the present utilization of such herbal treatments, both in developing and developed countries, often in the absence of scientific validation.

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Soil transmitted helminths (STHs) are among the world's neglected tropical diseases. Morbidity due to STHs is greatest in school-age children who typically have the highest burden of infection. In 2001, WHO passed a resolution for the use of large-scale mass drug administration (MDA) to deworm vulnerable children through school based programs. Though effective, there is concern that MDA might not be sustainable over extended periods. Additionally the current MDA strategy does not consider child malnutrition, a very common malady in resource limited countries. We report a pilot evaluation of an innovation that bundles school feeding and deworming.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;We designed a maize (corn) flour fortified with grounded dried papaya (Carica papaya) seeds and used it to prepare porridge as per the usual school meal recipe Children from three primary schools from Nandi County in Kenya were randomized into three arms: One school received 300 ml papaya fortified porridge daily (papaya group), the second school received similar serving of plain porridge without the pawpaw ingredient (control group) and the third school received plain porridge and the conventional MDA approach of one time 400 mg dosage of albendazole (albendazole arm). Prior to the randomization, an initial baseline stool microscopy analysis was done to determine presence and intensity of intestinal worms. Core indicators of nutrition-height, weight and hemoglobin counts were also assessed. The children were monitored daily for two months and final stool sample analysis and clinical monitoring done at the end of the study. Baseline and follow-up data were analyzed and compared through SAS version 9.1 statistical package.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;A total of 326 children participated in the trial. The overall prevalence of Ascaris lumbricoides was 29.4% (96), Trichuris Trichura 5.2% (17) and hookworm 1 (0.3%). Papaya seed fortified porridge reduced the Ascaris lumbricoides egg count by 63.9% after the two month period (mean 209.7epg to 75.7 p &lt; 0.002) as compared to the albendazole arm 78.8% (129.5 epg to 27.5, p value 0.006). The control group showed an increase in egg count (42.epg to 56.3) though it was not statistically significant. Hemoglobin counts in the papaya group increased from a mean of 2 g/dL (11.5 g/dL to 13.5 g/dL, p &lt; 0.001), as compared to the albendazole arm that increased by 1 g/dL (12.8-13.9, p &lt; 0.001). No significant change was observed in the placebo arm (13.2 to 13.1). Interestingly the papaya group showed a significant reduction of children with Tinea capitis (ringworms) (54.4 to 34%, p &lt; 0.002) as compared to the albendazole arm that showed an increase in ringworm infestation though not statistically significant (39.7 to 64.7% p = 0.608).&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Papaya seed fortified porridge had a significant effect on reduction of Ascaris lumbricoides burden. It had a better nutritional outcome and effect on child fungal infections than albendazole. Its application as a routine school meal may aid current national school based nutrition and deworming programs in Africa.&lt;h4&gt;Trial registration&lt;/h4&gt;This study was retrospectively registered at Clinicaltrials.gov Ref. NCT02725255 on 31st March 2016.">

        <span class="abst" title="Ipomoea imperati is widely used in tropical areas to treat several pathological conditions. The effect of this plant against parasitic species has not been investigated even being used for this purpose in the Brazilian northeastern. This study aimed to evaluate the anthelmintic and acaricide potential of a hydroethanolic extract of I. imperati leaves and stolons. I. imperati leaves and stolons were crushed and subjected to maceration in ethanol 70% (v/v), after which the solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator. The chromatographic profile of the extract was obtained by UV Spectrum high-performance liquid chromatography and compounds were identified by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Identification of the compounds present in the extract was achieved by comparing their retention times and UV spectra with data in the literature. Anthelmintic activity was evaluated by larval exsheathment inhibition assays using Haemonchus contortus larvae and five concentrations of each extract ranging from 0.07 to 1.2 mg/mL. Acaricide activity was evaluated via larval immersion of Rhipicephalus microplus in eight concentrations of each extract ranging from 5.0 to 25.0 mg/mL. Live and dead larvae were counted after 24 hours. The median inhibitory concentration (IC50) for H. contortus larvae and the median lethal concentration (LC50) for R. microplus larvae were calculated. Twelve compounds were observed in the hydroethanolic extract of leaves, with a predominance of the aglycone form of flavonoids and tannins. This extract was effective against H. contortus larvae, presenting an average inhibitory concentration of 0.22 mg/mL, but showed no activity toward R. microplus larvae. The stolon hydroethanolic extract presented 11 compounds, with phenolic acids and glycosylated flavonoids prevailing. This extract showed low activity on R. microplus and no effect on inhibiting H. contortus larval exsheathment at the concentrations tested. This study is the first to assess the anthelmintic and acaricidal activities of I. imperati. Data reported confirm promising potential of I. imperati leaves hydroethanolic extract against H. contortus. This effect could be due to its secondary compounds presents in this extract, such as procyanidin, kaempferol, isoquercitrin and rutin.">

Historically, plants have been important sources of therapeutic compounds and offer an alternative to synthetic drugs. Monoterpenoids are phytochemicals that have been shown to produce acute toxic effects in insects and nematodes. Previous studies have shown nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) to be possible targets for naturally occurring plant metabolites such as carvacrol and carveol. In this study we examined the effects of monoterpenoid compounds on a levamisole sensitive nAChR from Oesophagostomum dentatum and a nicotine sensitive nAChR from Ascaris suum. We expressed the receptors in Xenopus laevis oocytes and used two-electrode voltage-clamp to characterize the effect of various compounds on these cys-loop receptors. At 100 μM the majority of these compounds acted as antagonists. Interestingly, further experiments revealed that both 0.1 μM and 10 μM menthol potentiated acetylcholine and levamisole responses in the levamisole sensitive receptor but not the nicotine sensitive receptor. We also investigated the effects of 0.1 μM menthol on the contractility of A. suum somatic muscle strips. Menthol produced significant potentiation of peak contractions at each concentration of acetylcholine. The positive allosteric modulatory effects of menthol in both in vivo and in vitro experiments suggests menthol as a promising candidate for combination therapy with cholinergic anthelmintics.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Because of diverse topographical habitats, the Chenab River wetland harbors a wealth of medicinal and food plant species. This paper presents first quantitative assessment on the ethnobotanical use of plants by the local peoples residing in the Chenab riverine area. METHODS:The ethnobotanical data were collected from six parts of the Chenab River wetland: Mandi Bahuddin, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Sargodha, and Sialkot during 2014 to 2015, using semi-structured interviews. Quantitative indices including informant consensus factor (FCI), relative frequency of citation (RFC), relative importance level (RIL), use value (UV), fidelity level (FL), and corrected fidelity level (CFL) were used to analyze the data. RESULTS:On the whole, 129 medicinal plant species belonging to 112 genera of 59 families were reported, with herbs as dominant life forms (51%). Poaceae was the leading family with 13 species, and leaves were the most frequently utilized plant parts (28%). Herbal medicines were mostly used in the form of powder or decoction, and were mainly taken orally. Withania somnifera, Solanum surattense, Solanum nigrum, Azadirachta indica, Ficus benghalensis, Morus nigra, Morus alba, Polygonum plebeium, and Tribulus terrestris were among the highly utilized plant species, with highest UV, RFC, RIL, FL, and CFL values. The reported ailments were grouped into 11 categories based on FCI values, whereas highest FIC was recorded for gastrointestinal diseases and glandular diseases (0.41 and 0.34, respectively). The use report (UR) and frequency of citation (FC) depicted strong positive correlation (r = 0.973; p = 0.01). The value of determination (r2 = 0.95) indicating 95% variation in UR can be explained in terms of the FC. CONCLUSION:The significant traditional knowledge possessed by local communities depicts their strong relation with phytodiversity. Reported data could be helpful in sustainable use and protection of plant species in the Chenab wetland, with special emphasis on medicinal plants. Furthermore, screening of plant-borne active ingredients and in vivo/in vitro pharmacological activities could be of interest for novel drug synthesis.">

To map the association of schistosome infection with responses to these motifs, we assessed plasma IgE and IgG reactivity using microarray technology among Ugandans from rural Schistosoma mansoni (Sm)-endemic islands (n = 209), and from proximate urban communities with lower Sm exposure (n = 62). IgE and IgG responses to core β-1,2-xylose and α-1,3-fucose modified N-glycans were higher in rural versus urban participants. Among rural participants, IgE and IgG to core β-1,2-xylose were positively associated with Sm infection and concentration peaks coincided with the infection intensity peak in early adolescence. Responses to core α-1,3-fucose were elevated regardless of Sm infection status and peaked before the infection peak. Among urban participants, Sm infection intensity was predominantly light and positively associated with responses to both motifs. Principal component and hierarchical cluster analysis reduced the data to a set of variables that captured core β-1,2-xylose- and α-1,3-fucose-specific responses, and confirmed associations with Sm and the rural environment. Responses to core β-1,2-xylose and α-1,3-fucose have distinctive relationships with Sm infection and intensity that should further be explored for associations with protective immunity, and cross-reactivity with other exposures.">

From 1996 to 2018, the search for novel and eco-friendly biopesticides has resulted in the identification of 114 species belonging to 36 botanical families of Mexican plants with reported biological effects on 20 insect species and seven nematode species. Most plant species with detected pesticide properties belong to the families Asteraceae, Fabaceae, and Lamiaceae. Eighty-six metabolites have been identified as pesticidal active principles, and most have been terpenoids. Therefore, the continuation and intensification of this area of research is very important to contribute to the generation of new products that will provide alternatives to conventional pesticide agents. In addition, future studies will contribute to the recognition and dissemination of the importance of propagating plant species for their conservation and sustainable use.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Haemonchosis affects sheep husbandry and its treatment is often compromised due to the development of anthelminthic resistance. Plant-derived bioactive compounds have been studied as alternative to control Haemonchus contortus. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of Senecio brasiliensis extracts on H. contortus egg hatching and infective larvae migration. RESULTS:The aqueous extract from dried and fresh plant and alkaloid-enriched fraction of the previously dried leaves of S. brasiliensis inhibited H. contortus egg hatching. The main plant compound in alkaloid fraction was integerrimine, a pyrrolizidine alkaloid (PA). However, the aqueous extract from dried plant displayed higher efficacy when compared to their alkaloid enriched or non-polar fractions, meaning that, although PAs contributed to the ovicidal effect, other compounds in the plant can also contribute to their effect. Furthermore, the aqueous extract from dried plant also had higher efficacy than aqueous extract from fresh plant in larvae migration inhibition. Finally, extract from dried plant presented low in vitro cytotoxic effect. CONCLUSION:Taken together our results suggest a good anthelmintic effect of S. brasiliensis, especially when aqueous extract is prepared from dried plant. Further in vivo studies should be performed focused on forms of administration of this extract in rearing sheep.">

        <span class="abst" title="Natural products have moved into the spotlight as possible sources for new drugs in the treatment of helminth infections including schistosomiasis. Surprisingly, insect-derived compounds have largely been neglected so far in the search for novel anthelminthics, despite the generally recognized high potential of insect biotechnology for drug discovery. This motivated us to assess the antischistosomal capacity of harmonine, an antimicrobial alkaloid from the harlequin ladybird Harmonia axyridis that raised high interest in insect biotechnology in recent years. We observed remarkably pleiotropic effects of harmonine on physiological, cellular, and molecular processes in adult male and female Schistosoma mansoni at concentrations as low as 5 μM in vitro. This included tegumental damage, gut dilatation, dysplasia of gonads, a complete stop of egg production at 10 μM, and increased production of abnormally shaped eggs at 5 μM. Motility was reduced with an EC50 of 8.8 μM and lethal effects occurred at 10-20 μM within 3 days of culture. Enzyme inhibition assays revealed acetylcholinesterase (AChE) as one potential target of harmonine. To assess possible effects on stem cells, which represent attractive anthelminthic targets, we developed a novel in silico 3D reconstruction of gonads based on confocal laser scanning microscopy of worms after EdU incorporation to allow for quantification of proliferating stem cells per organ. Harmonine significantly reduced the number of proliferating stem cells in testes, ovaries, and also the number of proliferating parenchymal neoblasts. This was further supported by a downregulated expression of the stem cell markers nanos-1 and nanos-2 in harmonine-treated worms revealed by quantitative real-time PCR. Our data demonstrate a multifaceted antischistosomal activity of the lady beetle-derived compound harmonine, and suggest AChE and stem cell genes as possible targets. Harmonine is the first animal-derived alkaloid detected to have antischistosomal capacity. This study highlights the potential of exploiting insects as a source for the discovery of anthelminthics.">

A liniment from &lt;i&gt;Artemisia californica&lt;/i&gt; has recently been tested on patients affected by either acute pain or chronic pain conditions with great success. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of sesquiterpene lactones (SLs), representing the majority in the Asteraceae family. Leucodin, α-santonin and sclareolide (three SLs) were chosen to undergo chemical modifications. This pool of molecules underwent molecular modeling experiments using an in-house program, WATGEN, predicting the water network and its contribution to the overall affinity of the enzyme-ligand complex. The anti-inflammatory activity and the ability of compounds to modulate COX-2 expression have been evaluated in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells and in RIF-1 cells treated according to the Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) protocols using Photoprin (PH) as photosensitizer. Furthermore, commercially available assay kits were used to evaluate the concentration of PGE-2 and the direct inhibition of COX-2. All the tested molecules fit well in the enzyme binding pocket, but to get a substantial inhibition of the expression and activity of the enzyme as well as a reduction in the PGE2 concentration, high concentrations of the compounds are needed. The only exceptions being leucodin itself and &lt;b&gt;FP6&lt;/b&gt;, one of the α-santonin derivatives, presenting a CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; functional group. We believe that this class of compounds has some interesting potential in the treatment of pain and inflammation. Although, the activity seems to be due to a mechanism related to the expression of the COX enzymes rather than on a direct inhibition.">

Fourteen compounds were isolated from the propolis samples, including a novel compound Taxifolin-3-acetyl-4'-methyl ether (4), a flavanonol derivative. The crude extracts showed moderate activity against T. spiralis and C. elegans, while the purified compounds had low activity against P. falciparum. Anti-trypanosomal activity (EC50 = 0.7 µg/mL) was exhibited by a fraction containing a cardol identified as bilobol (10) and this fraction had no effect on Human Foreskin Fibroblasts (HFF), even at 2.0 mg/mL, thus demonstrating excellent selectivity. A metabolomics study was used to explore the mechanism of action of the fraction and it revealed significant disturbances in trypanosomal phospholipid metabolism, especially the formation of choline phospholipids. We conclude that a potent and highly selective new trypanocide may be present in the fraction.">

        <span class="abst" title="Murine studies suggest that the presence of some species of intestinal helminths is associated with changes in host microbiota composition and diversity. However, studies in humans have produced varied conclusions, and the impact appears to vary widely depending on the helminth species present. To demonstrate how molecular approaches to the human gut microbiome can provide insights into the complex interplay among disparate organisms, DNA was extracted from cryopreserved stools collected from residents of 5 rural Kenyan villages prior to and 3 weeks and 3 months following albendazole (ALB) therapy. Samples were analyzed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) for the presence of 8 species of intestinal parasites and by MiSeq 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Based on pretreatment results, the presence of neither &lt;i&gt;Ascaris lumbricoides&lt;/i&gt; nor &lt;i&gt;Necator americanus&lt;/i&gt; infection significantly altered the overall diversity of the microbiota in comparison with age-matched controls. Following ALB therapy and clearance of soil-transmitted helminths (STH), there were significant increases in the proportion of the microbiota made up by &lt;i&gt;Clostridiales&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0002; average fold change, 0.57) and reductions in the proportion made up by &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriales&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0004; average fold change, -0.58). There was a significant posttreatment decrease in Chao1 richness, even among individuals who were uninfected pretreatment, suggesting that antimicrobial effects must be considered in any posttreatment setting. Nevertheless, the helminth-associated changes in &lt;i&gt;Clostridiales&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriales&lt;/i&gt; suggest that clearance of STH, and of &lt;i&gt;N. americanus&lt;/i&gt; in particular, alters the gut microbiota.&lt;b&gt;IMPORTANCE&lt;/b&gt; The gut microbiome is an important factor in human health. It is affected by what we eat, what medicines we take, and what infections we acquire. In turn, it affects the way we absorb nutrients and whether we have excessive intestinal inflammation. Intestinal worms may have an important impact on the composition of the gut microbiome. Without a complete understanding of the impact of mass deworming programs on the microbiome, it is impossible to accurately calculate the cost-effectiveness of such public health interventions and to guard against any possible deleterious side effects. Our research examines this question in a &quot;real-world&quot; setting, using a longitudinal cohort, in which individuals with and without worm infections are treated with deworming medication and followed up at both three weeks and three months posttreatment. We quantify the impact of roundworms and hookworms on gut microbial composition, suggesting that the impact is small, but that treatment of hookworm infection results in significant changes. This work points to the need for follow-up studies to further examine the impact of hookworm on the gut microbiota and determine the health consequences of the observed changes.">

In the current study, the antiadhesive property of herbal extracts has been evaluated using Glycyrrhiza glabra (GG) and Terminalia chebula (TC) herbal extracts on Streptococcus mutans. Materials and Methods:The plant extracts (GG and TC) were powdered in mechanical grinder. Ten gram of each plant extract in powder form was placed in porous bag or thimble. The extract was placed in a round-bottom flask and was transferred into clean preweighed universal tubes. The yield strength of the extract was calculated. The antiadherence property of the herbal extract was evaluated using glass surface adherence test. Statistical Analysis:The statistical analysis was done using one-way analysis of variance followed by post hoc Tukey's test. Results:Both herbal extracts have significant antiadhesive and antimicrobial activity against S. mutans, however, high antiadherence property was seen with TC than GG. Conclusion:Both the plant extracts exhibit inhibitory activity against S. mutans. However, TC had more clinically significant results than GG, but it was found statistically insignificant.">

Plants used in traditional medicine can be identified as potential candidates for the synthesis of novel drug compounds to act against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;To determine the potential antimicrobial effects of ethanol, aqueous, and hexane extracts of five Sri Lankan medicinal plants against four human pathogens.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;i&gt;Asparagus falcatus&lt;/i&gt; (tubers), &lt;i&gt;Asteracantha longifolia&lt;/i&gt; (whole plant), &lt;i&gt;Vetiveria zizanioides&lt;/i&gt; (roots), &lt;i&gt;Epaltes divaricata&lt;/i&gt; (whole plant), and &lt;i&gt;Coriandrum sativum&lt;/i&gt; (seeds) were used in the study. Plant extracts were screened against four clinically important Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains, &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (ATCC 25923), &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; (ATCC 25922), &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; (ATCC 27853), and &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; (ATCC 700603). Antibacterial activity of plant extracts were monitored using the agar disc diffusion method. Eight concentrations of each positive plant extract were used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) by 5-fold dilution of plant extracts yielding a serial dilution of the original extract.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Ethanol, aqueous, and hexane extracts of &lt;i&gt;E. divaricata&lt;/i&gt; gave the maximum zones of inhibition of 16.3 mm, 7.4 mm, and 13.7 mm and MIC values of 0.48 mg/ml, 1.2 mg/ml, and 1.6 mg/ml, respectively, against &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt;.

        <span class="abst" title="Leishmaniasis and Chagas disease cause great impact on social and economic aspects of people living in developing countries. The treatments for these diseases are based on the same regimen for over 40 years, thus, there is an urgent need for the development of new drugs. In this scenario, Asteraceae plants (a family widely used in folk medicine worldwide) are emerging as an interesting source for new trypanocidal and leishmanicidal compounds. Herein, we provide a non-exhaustive review about the activity of plant-derived products from Asteraceae with inhibitory action toward &lt;i&gt;Leishmania&lt;/i&gt; spp. and &lt;i&gt;T. cruzi&lt;/i&gt;. Special attention was given to those studies aiming the isolation (or identification) of the bioactive compounds. Ferulic acid, rosmarinic acid, and ursolic acid (&lt;i&gt;Baccharis uncinella&lt;/i&gt; DC.) were efficient to treat experimental leishmaniasis; while deoxymikanolide (&lt;i&gt;Mikania micrantha&lt;/i&gt;) and (+)-15-hydroxy-labd-7-en-17-al (&lt;i&gt;Aristeguietia glutinosa&lt;/i&gt; Lam.) showed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; anti-&lt;i&gt;T. cruzi&lt;/i&gt; action. It is also important to highlight that several plant-derived products (compounds, essential oils) from &lt;i&gt;Artemisia&lt;/i&gt; plants have shown high inhibitory potential against &lt;i&gt;Leishmania&lt;/i&gt; spp., such as artemisinin and its derivatives. In summary, these compounds may help the development of new effective agents against these neglected diseases.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Krummhübel (after 1945, Karpacz) in the Sudety Mountains (now SW Poland) was called &quot;the village of pharmacists&quot;. At the end of the seventeenth century, there were 57 households, of which about 40 were inhabited by herbalists. Krummhübel herbalists were the first in the Sudety region who applied medicinal mixtures for the treatment of various diseases (using, among others, plants, oils, minerals and even viper venom) in contrast to previous herbalists who only indicated the use of individual plant species for specific diseases. Riesengebirge (in Polish Karkonosze) potions were sold in Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland and Russia, and some of them could even be purchased in Scandinavia and England. The purpose of this paper is an ethnopharmacological analysis of historical texts of herbalists from Krummhübel. Based on their recipes, we analysed the use reports of drugs. Recently, research on ethnobotany and ethnopharmacological analyses of historical materials or egodocuments related to formulations used in folk medicine have become an important source of acquiring knowledge about new medicines.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Based on 46 recipes of Krummhübel herbalists re-written by Reitzig (1943), we analysed the use reports of drugs which included plant taxa and other constituents such as animal formulations, fungi, inorganic and organic substances and minerals as well as tinctures (with alcohol/spirit) and elixirs (without alcohol/spirit). For each usage mentioned in the text, we recorded (i) the putative botanical identity of the taxon; (ii) the plant family or origin of other than the plant constituent; (iii) the reported plant part; (iv) the number of the recipe; (v) the name of the recipe; (vi) the vernacular name of ingredient; (vii) the described symptom, ailment or specific use; (viii) our modern (viz. biomedical) interpretation of the described symptom or ailment; (ix) the mode of administration; and (x) the category of use under which we filed the specific use. We also cross-checked the medicinal plants of Krummhübel herbalists with the species described in old manuscripts and regional surveys and compared their use with contemporary plant use.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The paper introduces the generated database comprising 348 use reports of 46 drugs based on 70 plant taxa and other constituents. Besides, we address patterns such as the frequent recommendation of Fabaceae herbs for respiratory system issue and gynaecology and Asteraceae for respiratory system and cardiovascular problems. Gastrointestinal use reports are based on Asphodelaceae, Burseraceae and Rosaceae species.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Remedies that lost importance over time as well as drugs used for diseases now controlled by conventional medicine may be interesting starting points for research on herbal medicine and drug discovery. It seems to be important to attempt to reproduce therapeutic mixtures from the preserved recipes of Krummhübel herbalists, which offers an opportunity to learn more about the real effects of the former medicines and their therapeutic activity. The obtained data can also be used to search for new drugs.">

        <span class="abst" title="The secondary metabolite Tyrian purple, also known as shellfish purple and royal purple, is a dye with historical importance for humans. The biosynthetic origin of Tyrian purple in Muricidae molluscs is not currently known. A possible role for symbiotic bacteria in the production of tyrindoxyl sulphate, the precursor to Tyrian purple stored in the Australian species, &lt;i&gt;Dicathais orbita&lt;/i&gt;, has been proposed. This study aimed to culture bacterial symbionts from the purple producing hypobranchial gland, and screen the isolates for bromoperoxidase genes using molecular methods. The ability of bromoperoxidase positive isolates to produce the brominated indole precursor to Tyrian purple was then established by extraction of the culture, and analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In total, 32 bacterial isolates were cultured from &lt;i&gt;D. orbita&lt;/i&gt; hypobranchial glands, using marine agar, marine agar with hypobranchial gland aqueous extracts, blood agar, thiosulphate citrate bile salts sucrose agar, and cetrimide agar at pH 7.2. These included 26 &lt;i&gt;Vibrio&lt;/i&gt; spp., two &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; spp., one &lt;i&gt;Phaeobacter&lt;/i&gt; sp., one &lt;i&gt;Shewanella&lt;/i&gt; sp., one &lt;i&gt;Halobacillus&lt;/i&gt; sp. and one &lt;i&gt;Pseudoalteromonas&lt;/i&gt; sp.

LC-MS analysis of the supernatant and cell pellets from the bromoperoxidase producing &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; spp. cultured in tryptone broth, supplemented with KBr, confirmed their ability to produce the brominated precursor to Tyrian purple, tyrindoxyl sulphate.

The nutritional importance of walnut fruit is ascribed to its kernel. The shell and husk are burned as fuel or discarded away as waste products. In the past two decades, the evaluation of the phenolic content and antioxidant activity of different parts of walnut has received great interest. In this contribution, the recent reports on the extraction and quantification of phenolic content from each part of the walnut tree and fruit using different solvents were highlighted and comparatively reviewed.

A systematic literature survey from scientific databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science as well as from some textbooks and classical texts was conducted. The plant, mainly its bulb, contains various bioactive constituents, such as alkylresorcinols, bufadienolides, phytosterols, and flavonoids. Various scientific studies have proven that the plant has anthelmintic, anticancer, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and wound healing activities. The present work concludes that &lt;i&gt;D.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;indica&lt;/i&gt; has the potential to treat various diseases, mainly microbial infections. This review also suggests that bufadienolides, flavonoids, and steroids might be responsible for its bioactive potential.">

As a source of nematode eggs, pooled fresh fecal samples taken from dairy donkeys naturally infected by gastrointestinal nematodes were used. From fecal samples, eggs were recovered, suspended in deionized water, and used immediately in the bioassay (egg hatch test). The activity of the tested compounds was compared to positive (0.1% thiabendazole) and negative (deionized water and 1% DMSO) controls. All experiments were repeated in triplicate and the obtained data were statistically analyzed. All the tested plant compounds caused a significant (p &lt; 0.05) inhibition of nematode egg hatching (&gt;80%). Moreover, all saponins and prosapogenins showed in vitro anthelmintic properties statistically comparable to that of the reference drug (p &lt; 0.05), except for MPS extract.

        <span class="abst" title="Cyclotides are a novel class of micro-proteins (≈30-40 residues long) with a unique topology containing a head-to-tail cyclized backbone structure further stabilized by three disulfide bonds that form a cystine knot. This unique molecular framework makes them exceptionally stable to physical, chemical, and biological degradation compared to linear peptides of similar size. The cyclotides are also highly tolerant to sequence variability, aside from the conserved residues forming the cystine knot, and are orally bioavailable and able to cross cellular membranes to modulate intracellular protein-protein interactions (PPIs), both in vitro and in vivo. These unique properties make them ideal scaffolds for many biotechnological applications, including drug discovery. This review provides an overview of the properties of cyclotides and their potential for the development of novel peptide-based therapeutics. The selective disruption of PPIs still remains a very challenging task, as the interacting surfaces are relatively large and flat. The use of the cell-permeable highly constrained polypeptide molecular frameworks, such as the cyclotide scaffold, has shown great promise, as it provides unique pharmacological properties. The use of molecular techniques, such as epitope grafting, and molecular evolution have shown to be highly effective for the selection of bioactive cyclotides. However, despite successes in employing cyclotides to target PPIs, some of the challenges to move them into the clinic still remain.">

Despite several efforts at chemotherapeutic interventions, the disease poses serious health and economic concerns to humans and livestock of many sub-Saharan African countries. &lt;i&gt;Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides&lt;/i&gt; (Lam.) Zepern. &amp; Timler (&lt;i&gt;Z. zanthoxyloides&lt;/i&gt; LZT) is a plant species of important phytochemical and pharmacological relevance in the subtropical zones of the African continent. However, the mechanisms of its antitrypanosomal effects in African trypanosomes remain to be elucidated. The aim of the study was to determine the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; effects and mechanisms of action of &lt;i&gt;Z. zanthoxyloides&lt;/i&gt; LZT (root) fractions against &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma brucei&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;T. brucei&lt;/i&gt; (GUTat 3.1 strain), &lt;i&gt;L. donovani&lt;/i&gt; (D10 strain), &lt;i&gt;P. falciparum&lt;/i&gt; (3D 7 strain), Jurkat cells, and Chang liver cells were cultivated &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; to the log phase in their respective media at 37°C. Crude extracts and fractions were prepared from air-dried pulverized plant material of &lt;i&gt;Z. zanthoxyloides&lt;/i&gt; LZT (root) using the modified Kupchan method of solvent partitioning. Half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) were determined through the alamar blue cell viability assay. Effects of fractions on cell death and cell cycle of &lt;i&gt;T. brucei&lt;/i&gt; were determined using flow cytometry. Fluorescence microscopy was used to investigate the effects of fractions on the morphology and distribution of &lt;i&gt;T. brucei&lt;/i&gt;. Antitrypanosomal compounds of fractions were characterized using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopy. Methanol, butanol, and dichloromethane fractions were selectively active against &lt;i&gt;T. brucei&lt;/i&gt; with respective IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 3.89, 4.02, and 5.70 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml. Moreover, methanol, butanol, and dichloromethane fractions significantly induced apoptosis-like cell death with remarkable alteration in the cell cycle of &lt;i&gt;T. brucei&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, dichloromethane and methanol fractions altered the morphology, induced aggregation, and altered the ratio of nuclei to kinetoplasts in the parasite. The HPLC chromatograms and ATR-IR spectra of the active fractions suggested the presence of aromatic hydrocarbons with hydroxyl, carbonyl, amine, or amide functional groups. The results suggest that &lt;i&gt;Z. zanthoxyloides&lt;/i&gt; LZT have potential chemotherapeutic effects on African trypanosomes with implications for novel therapeutic interventions in African trypanosomiasis.">

Despite the efforts of pharmaceuticals in producing relatively new antimicrobial drugs, they have resulted in a high rate of mortality, disability and diseases across the world especially in developing countries. Supporting this claim was the report of the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) who estimated that over 2 million illnesses and 23,000 deaths per year are attributable to antibiotic resistant pathogens in the United States. They include Methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA), Vancomycin-intermediate &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (VISA), Vancomycin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (VRSA), Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), Extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) producing gram-negative bacilli, Multidrug-resistant &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; (MDRSP), Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and Multidrug-resistant &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt;. For MRSA, resistance is as a result of Methicillin-sensitive &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MSSA) strains that have acquired Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome mec (SCCmec) which carries mecA gene. The gene encodes the penicillin-binding protein (PBP2a) which confers resistance to all β-lactam antibiotics. Vancomycin was previously the widely preferred drug for the treatment of MRSA infections. It is no longer the case with the emergence of &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; strains with reduced vancomycin sensitivity limiting the conventional treatment options for MRSA infections to very scanty expensive drugs. Presently, many researchers have reported the antibacterial activity of many plant extracts on MRSA. Hence, these medicinal plants might be promising candidates for treatment of MRSA infections. This work is a brief review on Methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA) and the anti-MRSA activities of extracts of selected medicinal plants.">

In the Eastern Cape province of South Africa, a large proportion of the population reliant (to some extent) on botanical resources for beauty and health. Despite the use of these botanical resources for various cosmetic purposes, only a few have been fully commercialized or used as ingredients in cosmetic formulation. The present study aimed to review plant species that are fully explored commercially for cosmetic products in the Eastern Cape province. A survey of cosmetic products with plant-based ingredients was done covering the major supermarkets (SPAR, Shoprite, and Pick n Pay), cosmetic shops (Clicks), and pharmacies in the Eastern Cape province, and electronic databases including Embase, Google Scholar, Medline, PubMed, Scopus, SciFinder&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, Springer, Science Direct, and Web of Science were used as data sources for ethnobotanical information. Surprisingly, out of 150 plant species used by both Xhosa men and women for various cosmeceutical purposes, only six plant species have been used commercially with regard to cosmeceutical application. These plants species belong to five major plant families, namely &lt;i&gt;Lamiaceae&lt;/i&gt; (two species), &lt;i&gt;Asphodelaceae&lt;/i&gt; (one species) &lt;i&gt;Cucurbitaceae&lt;/i&gt; (one species), &lt;i&gt;Oleaceae&lt;/i&gt; (one species), and &lt;i&gt;Verbenaceae&lt;/i&gt; (one species). The findings revealed that the use of Eastern Cape plants for cosmetic purposes has not been fully explored commercially.

Genetic variation drives differences in host immune responses, which, along with environmental factors, generates temporal and spatial infection patterns in natural populations that epidemiologists seek to predict and control. However, genetics and immunology are typically studied in model systems, whereas population-level patterns of infection status and susceptibility are uniquely observable in nature. Despite obvious causal connections, organizational scales from genes to host outcomes to population patterns are rarely linked explicitly. Here we identify two loci near genes involved in macrophage (phagocyte) activation and pathogen degradation that additively increase risk of bovine tuberculosis infection by up to ninefold in wild African buffalo. Furthermore, we observe genotype-specific variation in IL-12 production indicative of variation in macrophage activation. Here, we provide measurable differences in infection resistance at multiple scales by characterizing the genetic and inflammatory variation driving patterns of infection in a wild mammal.">

Similarly, the fumigation LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of carvacrol was 8.2 µL L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; after 1 h of exposure, strongly decreasing to 0.8 µL L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; after 24 h of exposure. These results support the folk usage of Lebanese oregano as an antiparasitic agent, providing new insights about its utilization for developing new effective and eco-friendly nematocidal and insecticidal products.">

The study determined the extract concentration that produced the highest efficacy based on the average recorded mean motility time, gross, and microscopic changes of the flukes treated with different concentrations of plant extracts.&lt;h4&gt;Material and methods&lt;/h4&gt;The study consisted of eight treatments. Every treatment consisted of 10%, 20%, and 40% concentrations of both betel nut extract (BNE) and neem leaf extracts, positive control treatment (Albendazole-treated) and negative control treatment (25 ml nutrient broth). The motility of the flukes on all treatments was based on the established motility criteria scoring. The flukes subjected to all treatments were processed for histopathological analysis.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The result of the study revealed that after exposure of &lt;i&gt;Fasciola&lt;/i&gt; spp. under 10%, 20%, and 40% extract concentrations, betel nut showed higher efficacy having the recorded mean motility time of 0.22, 0.07 min, and no movement upon contact, respectively, than Albendazole which produced mean motility time of 0.38 min. Nevertheless, the flukes treated with 10%, 20%, and 40% neem leaf extracts obtained the average mean motility time of 220, 151, and 98 min, respectively.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The results gathered showed that 40% BNE concentration showed the highest efficacy based on the recorded mean motility time. All treatments of betel nut extract evidently showed marked changes in the gross and microscopic morphology of the flukes. However, the neem extract was ineffective in all concentrations although changes were observed microscopically. Furthermore, the nutrient broth was proven to be effective as a culture medium since the flukes remained active until 8 h of exposure.">

The zoonotic potential of S. stercoralis and the potential role of dogs in the maintenance of strongyloidiasis transmission has been a topic of interest and discussion for many years. In Australia, strongyloidiasis is prevalent in remote socioeconomically disadvantaged communities in the north of the continent. Being an isolated continent that has been separated from other regions for a long geological period, description of diversity of Australian Strongyloides genotypes adds to our understanding of the genetic diversity within the genus. Using PCR and amplicon sequencing (Illumina sequencing technology), we sequenced the Strongyloides SSU rDNA hyper-variable I and hyper-variable IV regions using Strongyloides-specific primers, and a fragment of the mtDNA cox1 gene using primers that are broadly specific for Strongyloides sp. and hookworms. These loci were amplified from DNA extracted from Australian human and dog faeces, and one human sputum sample. Using this approach, we confirm for the first time that potentially zoonotic S. stercoralis populations are present in Australia, suggesting that dogs represent a potential reservoir of human strongyloidiasis in remote Australian communities.">

Three doses were used (200, 100 and 50 mg/ml) to study the anthelmintic activity of &lt;i&gt;S. persica&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Allolobophora caliginosa&lt;/i&gt; was used as a model worm.

Experimental mice were treated with SE (300 mg/Kg) for 5 days. The extract was able to decrease the number of meronts and gamonts of the parasite in jejunum. Also, it regulates the level of glutathione and malondialdehyde and the activity of catalase as well.

MEFZ at doses of 200, 400, and 600 mg/kg/d were administered orally for 4 consecutive days (days 0-4) to &lt;i&gt;P. berghei-&lt;/i&gt;infected mice. The possible ameliorative effects of MEFZ on malaria-associated organ malfunctions were also assessed. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; At 200, 400 and 600 mg/kg b.w., respectively, MEFZ produced 82.37% and 68.39%, 84.84%, and 90.75%, 95.95% and 92.67% chemosuppression and inhibition of &lt;i&gt;P. berghei&lt;/i&gt;, respectively, comparable to 98.67% and 97.29% by combisunate, a standard antimalarial. The IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of MEFZ was estimated to be 235.23 mg/kg b.w. Similarly, treatment of parasitized mice with MEFZ significantly restored the malaria-modified haematological and biochemical status of the parasitized-MEFZ-treated mice compared with parasitized-untreated mice. MEFZ was tolerable up to 5000 mg/kg b.w dose; hence, the LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; is above 5000 mg/kg b.w. &lt;b&gt;Discussion and conclusions:&lt;/b&gt; The results of this curative assay demonstrated that MEFZ has antimalarial effects and normalized haematological and biochemical aberrations generated by malaria. The isolation of the antimalarial principles in MEFZ is warranted; they could be lead molecules for the development of new antimalarials.">

        <span class="abst" title="Whole-genome sequencing is being rapidly applied to the study of helminth genomes, including de novo genome assembly, population genetics, and diagnostic applications. Although late-stage juvenile and adult parasites typically produce sufficient DNA for molecular analyses, these parasitic stages are almost always inaccessible in the live host; immature life stages found in the environment for which samples can be collected non-invasively offer a potential alternative; however, these samples typically yield very low quantities of DNA, can be environmentally resistant, and are susceptible to contamination, often from bacterial or host DNA. Here, we have tested five low-input DNA extraction protocols together with a low-input sequencing library protocol to assess the feasibility of whole-genome sequencing of individual immature helminth samples. These approaches do not use whole-genome amplification, a common but costly approach to increase the yield of low-input samples. We first tested individual parasites from two species spotted onto FTA cards-egg and L1 stages of Haemonchus contortus and miracidia of Schistosoma mansoni-before further testing on an additional five species-Ancylostoma caninum, Ascaridia dissimilis, Dirofilaria immitis, Strongyloides stercoralis, and Trichuris muris-with an optimal protocol. A sixth species-Dracunculus medinensis-was included for comparison. Whole-genome sequencing followed by analyses to determine the proportion of on- and off-target mapping revealed successful sample preparations for six of the eight species tested with variation both between species and between different life stages from some species described. These results demonstrate the feasibility of whole-genome sequencing of individual parasites, and highlight a new avenue toward generating sensitive, specific, and information-rich data for the diagnosis and surveillance of helminths.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Fascioliasis is a neglected zoonosis with major public health implications in humans. Although triclabendazole (TCBZ) is the drug of choice, there are records of TCBZ failure worldwide. TCBZ-resistant fascioliasis is treated with alternative approved drugs including nitazoxanide (NTZ), with varying levels of efficacy. Data on NTZ efficacy after TCBZ failure in Egypt is scarce. This study evaluated the efficacy of NTZ in cases of TCBZ failure during an outbreak of fascioliasis in Assiut governorate of Upper Egypt. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:This prospective study included 67 patients from the outpatient clinic in Manfalout locality of Assiut governorate with clinical manifestations of acute fascioliasis. These included high eosinophilia (&gt; 6% eosinophils in peripheral blood), positive anti-Fasciola antibodies, and hepatic focal lesions (HFL) or ascites on abdominal ultrasound or computed tomography. All patients initially received TCBZ at recommended doses. Patients were followed up after 1 month to assess response. According to the responses, patients were categorized as non-responders and responders. The non-responders received a trial of NTZ and were re-assessed for response based on clinical manifestations, eosinophil count, and abdominal ultrasound. Patients not responding to NTZ received additional doses of TCBZ. One month after initial TCBZ treatment, 37 patients responded well to TCBZ, while 30 patients failed to respond with persistence of fever, abdominal pain, high eosinophilia, and HFL. Most non-responders were male (56.7%); females predominated among TCBZ responders (62.2%). The mean age of the non-responders was relatively lower, at 20.57 ± 14.47 years (p = 0.004). Following NTZ therapy, HFL disappeared in 9/30 (30%) patients and eosinophil counts normalized in only 2 (6.7%) patients, indicating an overall efficacy of 36.6%. The remaining cases received additional doses of TCBZ with complete clinical, biochemical, and radiological resolution. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:Nitazoxanide was partially effective in TCBZ failure in acute human fascioliasis in Upper Egypt. Further studies with larger samples are highly encouraged and further research is urgently needed to find new therapeutic alternatives to TCBZ.">

This zoonotic parasitic infection remains a major health problem in certain areas of the world where is still endemic. In view of the ineffectiveness of some drug treatments, the surgical removal of cysts remains the preferred treatment option together with the administration of albendazole and mebendazole. However, severe side effects of these drugs have been reported which demands developing new scolicidal agents that confer suitable efficacy and fewer side effects during surgery.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;To that purpose, in the present work we assessed the effectiveness of ivermectin (IVM), a macrocyclic lactone endectocide that has shown to be an effective nematocidal drug against other important parasitic infections. To overcome the limitations observed in some drug formulations and resistance, we used nano lipid carriers (NLCs) as a targeted and sustained drug delivery system for IVM. We evaluated the in vitro cestocidal and apoptotic effects of NLCs-loaded IVM versus IVM by quantifying the expression of caspase-3 mRNA.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;We found that after 60 and 120 min of administration, 800 μg/ml and 400 μg/ml NLCs-loaded IVM induced 100% mortality, respectively. On the other hand, the 800 μg/ml of IVM induced 100% mortality rate 150 min after administration. Additionally, we found that NLCs-loaded IVM induced higher mRNA caspase-3 expression suggesting a more potent apoptotic effect on the parasite.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;These data suggest that NLCs-loaded IVM may be a promising alternative to current treatments although in vivo studies are needed.">

A reliable quantification of gene expression in all parasite life stages relevant for targeting by anthelmintics in the mammalian host is fundamental. The aim of this study was to define a set of stably expressed reference genes for qRT-PCR in Fasciola studies. We determined the expression stabilities of eight candidate reference genes by the algorithms NormFinder, geNorm, BestKeeper, and comparative ΔCT method. The most stably expressed reference genes for the comparison of intra-mammalian life stages were glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (Fheprs) and tubulin-specific chaperone D (Fhtbcd). The two best reference genes for analysis of in vitro-cultured juveniles were Fhtbcd and proteasome subunit beta type-7 (Fhpsmb7). These genes should replace the housekeeping gene gapdh which is used in most Fasciola studies to date, but in fact was differentially expressed in our analysis. Based on the new reference genes, we quantified expression of five kinases (Abl1, Abl2, PKC, Akt1, Plk1) discussed as targets in other parasitic flatworms. Distinct expression patterns throughout development were revealed and point to interesting biological functions. We like to motivate using this set of validated reference genes for future F. hepatica research, such as studies on drug targets or parasite development.">

In this study, a pan-cancer genomics survey based on Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data indicated that HMGA2 was mainly overexpressed in gastrointestinal cancers including colorectal cancer. Intriguingly, HMGA2 overexpression had no prognostic impacts on cancer patients' overall and disease-free survivals. In addition, HMGA2-overexpressing colorectal cancer cell lines did not display higher susceptibility to a previously identified HMGA2 inhibitor (netroposin). By microarray profiling of HMGA2-driven gene signature and subsequent Connectivity Map (CMap) database mining, we identified that S100 calcium-binding protein A4 (S100A4) may be a druggable vulnerability for HMGA2-overexpressing colorectal cancer. A repurposing S100A4 inhibitor, niclosamide, was found to reverse the HMGA2-driven gene signature both in colorectal cancer cell lines and patients' tissues. In vitro and in vivo experiments validated that HMGA2-overexpressing colorectal cancer cells were more sensitive to niclosamide. However, inhibition of S100A4 by siRNAs and other inhibitors was not sufficient to exert effects like niclosamide. Further RNA sequencing analysis identified that niclosamide inhibited more cell-cycle-related gene expression in HMGA2-overexpressing colorectal cancer cells, which may explain its selective anticancer effect. Together, our study repurposes an anthelminthic drug niclosamide for treating HMGA2-overexpression colorectal cancer.">

In view of the importance of nematodes, it is of much interest to identify novel molecular characteristics that are distinctive features of this phylum, or specific taxonomic groups/clades within it, thereby providing innovative means for diagnostics as well as genetic and biochemical studies. Using genome sequences for 52 available nematodes, a robust phylogenetic tree was constructed based on concatenated sequences of 17 conserved proteins. The branching of species in this tree provides important insights into the evolutionary relationships among the studied nematode species. In parallel, detailed comparative analyses on protein sequences from nematodes (Caenorhabditis) species reported here have identified 52 novel molecular signatures (or synapomorphies) consisting of conserved signature indels (CSIs) in different proteins, which are uniquely shared by the homologs from either all genome-sequenced Caenorhabditis species or a number of higher taxonomic clades of nematodes encompassing this genus. Of these molecular signatures, 39 CSIs in proteins involved in diverse functions are uniquely present in all Caenorhabditis species providing reliable means for distinguishing this group of nematodes in molecular terms. The remainder of the CSIs are specific for a number of higher clades of nematodes and offer important insights into the evolutionary relationships among these species. The structural locations of some of the nematodes-specific CSIs were also mapped in the structural models of the corresponding proteins. All of the studied CSIs are localized within the surface-exposed loops of the proteins suggesting that they may potentially be involved in mediating novel protein-protein or protein-ligand interactions, which are specific for these groups of nematodes. The identified CSIs, due to their exclusivity for the indicated groups, provide reliable means for the identification of species within these nematodes groups in molecular terms. Further, due to the predicted roles of these CSIs in cellular functions, they provide important tools for genetic and biochemical studies in Caenorhabditis and other nematodes.">

This study aimed to explore the extent to which coprological diagnoses for F. hepatica in red deer in the Scottish Highlands, Scotland, are associated with variability among hosts and habitats. METHODS:Our analyses were based on coproantigen ELISA diagnoses derived from faecal samples that were collected from carcasses of culled deer on nine hunting estates during two sampling seasons. Sampling locations were used as centroids about which circular home ranges were quantified. Data were stratified by season, and associations between host, hydrological, land cover and meteorological variables and binary diagnoses during 2013-2014 (n = 390) were explored by mixed effect logistic regression. The ability of our model to predict diagnoses relative to that which would be expected by chance was quantified, and data collected during 2012-2013 (n = 289) were used to assess model transferability. RESULTS:During 2013-2014, habitat and host characteristics explained 28% of variation in diagnoses, whereby half of the explained variation was attributed to differences among estates. The probability of a positive diagnosis was positively associated with the length of streams in the immediate surroundings of each sampling location, but no non-zero relationships were found for land cover or lifetime average weather variables. Regardless of habitat, the probability of a positive diagnosis remained greatest for males, although males were always sampled earlier in the year than females. A slight decrease in prediction efficacy occurred when our model was used to predict diagnoses for out-of-sample data. CONCLUSIONS:We are cautious to extrapolate our findings geographically, owing to a large proportion of variation attributable to overarching differences among estates. Nevertheless, the temporal transferability of our model is encouraging. While we did not identify any non-zero relationship between meteorological variables and probability of diagnosis, we attribute this (in part) to limitations of interpolated meteorological data. Further study into non-independent diagnoses within estates and differences among estates in terms of deer management, would improve our understanding of F. hepatica prevalence in wild deer.">

Since control is threatened by the appearance of drug resistant nematodes, there is a need to develop novel compounds, among which phytochemicals constitute potential anthelmintic agents. Caenorhabditis elegans has been pivotal in anthelmintic drug discovery and in revealing mechanisms of drug action and resistance. By using C. elegans, we here revealed the anthelmintic actions of three plant terpenoids -thymol, carvacrol and eugenol- at the behavioral level. Terpenoids produce a rapid paralysis of worms with a potency rank order carvacrol &gt; thymol &gt; eugenol. In addition to their paralyzing activity, they also inhibit egg hatching, which would, in turn, lead to a broader anthelmintic spectrum of activity. To identify drug targets, we performed an in vivo screening of selected strains carrying mutations in receptors involved in worm locomotion for determining resistance to the paralyzing effect of terpenoids. The assays revealed that two Cys-loop receptors with key roles in worm locomotion -Levamisole sensitive nicotinic receptor (L-AChR) and GABA(A) (UNC-49) receptor- are involved in the paralyzing effects of terpenoids. To decipher the mechanism by which terpenoids affect these receptors, we performed electrophysiological studies using a primary culture of C. elegans L1 muscle cells. Whole cell recordings from L1 cells demonstrated that terpenoids decrease macroscopic responses of L-AChR and UNC-49 receptor to their endogenous agonists, thus acting as inhibitors. Single-channel recordings from L-AChR revealed that terpenoids decrease the frequency of opening events, probably by acting as negative allosteric modulators. The fact that terpenoids act at different receptors may have important advantages regarding efficacy and development of resistance. Thus, our findings give support to the use of terpenoids as either an alternative or a complementary anthelmintic strategy to overcome the ever-increasing resistance of parasites to classical anthelmintic drugs.">

        <span class="abst" title="Vacuolar processing enzymes (VPEs) play an important role during regular growth and development and defence responses. Despite substantial attempts to understand the molecular basis of plant-cyst nematode interaction, the mechanism of VPEs functioning during this interaction remains unknown. The second-stage Heterodera filipjevi juvenile penetrates host roots and induces the formation of a permanent feeding site called a syncytium. To investigate whether infection with H. filipjevi alters plant host VPEs, the studies were performed in Hordeum vulgare roots and leaves on the day of inoculation and at 7, 14 and 21 days post-inoculation (dpi). Implementing molecular, biochemical and microscopic methods we identified reasons for modulation of barley VPE activity during interaction with H. filipjevi. Heterodera filipjevi parasitism caused a general decrease of VPE activity in infected roots, but live imaging of VPEs showed that their activity is up-regulated in syncytia at 7 and 14 dpi and down-regulated at 21 dpi. These findings were accompanied by tissue-specific VPE gene expression patterns. Expression of the barley cystatin HvCPI-4 gene was stimulated in leaves but diminished in roots upon infestation. External application of cyclotides that can be produced naturally by VPEs elicits in pre-parasitic juveniles vesiculation of their body, enhanced formation of granules, induction of exploratory behaviour (stylet thrusts and head movements), production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and final death by methuosis. Taken together, down-regulation of VPE activity through nematode effectors promotes the nematode invasion rates and leads to avoidance of the induction of the plant proteolytic response and death of the invading juveniles.">

        <span class="abst" title="Chagas disease (CD) is a tropical neglected illness, affecting mainly populations of low socioeconomic status in Latin America. An estimated 6 to 8 million people worldwide are infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of CD. Despite being one of the main global health problems, this disease continues without effective treatment during the chronic phase of the infection. The limitation of therapeutic strategies has been one of the biggest challenges on the fight against CD. Nifurtimox and benznidazole, developed in the 1970s, are still the only commercial options with established efficacy on CD. However, the efficacy of these drugs have a proven efficacy only during early infection and the benefits in the chronic phase are questionable. Consequently, there is a growing need for new pharmacological alternatives, either by optimization of existing drugs or by the formulation of new compounds. In the present study, a literature review of the currently adopted therapy, its concomitant combination with other drugs, and potential future treatments for CD was performed, considering articles published from 2012. The revised articles were selected according to the protocol of treatment: evaluation of drug association, drug repositioning and research of new drugs. As a result of the present revision, it was possible to conclude that the use of benznidazole in combination with other compounds showed better results when compared with its use as a single therapy. The search of new drugs has been the strategy most used in pursuing more effective forms of treatment for CD. However, studies have still focused on basic research, that is, they are still in a pre-clinical stage, using methodologies based on in vitro or in animal studies.">

Xenobiotics, taken up through passive diffusion, accumulate in the membranes, where they are captured by transporters, among which P-glycoproteins (Pgps). In nematodes such as Haemonchus contortus, eggshells and cuticles provide additional protective barriers against xenobiotics. Little is known about the role of these structures in the transport of chemical molecules. Pgps, members of the ABC transporter family, are present in eggshells and cuticles. Changes in the activity of these proteins have also been correlated with alterations in lipids, such as cholesterol content, in eggshells. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. We show here that an experimental decrease in the cholesterol content of eggshells of Haemonchus contortus, with Methyl-beta-CycloDextrin (MβCD), results in an increase in membrane fluidity, favouring Pgp activity and leading to an increase in resistance to anthelmintics. This effect is modulated by the initial degree of anthelminthic resistance of the eggs. These results suggest that eggshell fluidity plays a major role in the modulation of Pgp activity. They confirm that Pgp activity is highly influenced by the local microenvironment, in particular sterols, as observed in some vertebrate models. Thus, eggshell barriers could play an active role in the transport of xenobiotics.">

        <span class="abst" title="Phloroglucinol (1,3,5 tri-hydroxy-benzene) (PGL), a natural phenolic substance, is a peroxidase inhibitor and has anti-oxidant, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, radio-protective, spasmolytic and anti-cancer activities. PGL, as a medicine, is administered to patients to control the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and acute renal colic, in clinical trials. PGL, as a phenolic substance, can cause cytotoxic effects. Administration of PGL up to 300 mg/kg (bw) is well tolerated by animals, while in cell lines its toxicity is developed at concentrations above the dose of 10 μg/ml. Furthermore, it seems that tumor or immortalized cells are more susceptible to the toxic power of PGL, than normal cells. However, studies of its cytotoxic potency, at the cellular level, in complex, differentiated and meta-mitotic biological systems, are still missing. In the present work, we have investigated the toxic activity of PGL in somatic epithelial cells, constituting the follicular compartment of a developing egg-chamber (or, follicle), which directs the choriogenesis (i.e. chorion assembly) process, during late oogenesis of Drosophila melanogaster. Our results reveal that treatment of in vitro growing Drosophila follicles with PGL, at a concentration of 0.2 mM (or, 25.2 μg/ml), does not lead to follicle-cell toxicity, since the protein-synthesis program and developmental pattern of choriogenesis are normally completed. Likewise, the 1 mM dose of PGL was also characterized by lack of toxicity, since the chorionic proteins were physiologically synthesized and the chorion structure appeared unaffected, except for a short developmental delay, being observed. In contrast, concentrations of 10, 20 or 40 mM of PGL unveiled a dose-dependent, increasing, toxic effect, being initiated by interruption of protein synthesis and disassembly of cell-secretory machinery, and, next, followed by fragmentation of the granular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into vesicles, and formation of autophagic vacuoles. Follicle cells enter into an apoptotic process, with autophagosomes and large vacuoles being formed in the cytoplasm, and nucleus showing protrusions, granular nucleolus and condensed chromatin. PGL, also, proved able to induce disruption of nuclear envelope, activation of nucleus autophagy (nucleophagy) and formation of a syncytium-like pattern being produced by fusion of plasma membranes of two or more individual follicle cells. Altogether, follicle cell-dependent choriogenesis in Drosophila has been herein presented as an excellent, powerful and reliable multi-cellular, differentiated, model biological (animal) system for drug-cytotoxicity assessment, with the versatile compound PGL serving as a characteristic paradigm. In conclusion, PGL is a substance that may act beneficially for a variety of pathological conditions and can be safely used for differentiated somatic -epithelial- cells at clinically low concentrations. At relatively high doses, it could potentially induce apoptotic and autophagic cell death, thus being likely exploited as a therapeutic agent against a number of pathologies, including human malignancies.">

        <span class="abst" title="Host-parasite interactions may be modulated by host- or parasite-associated microbes, but the role of these are often overlooked. Particularly for parasites with intestinal stages (either larval or adult), the host gut microbiome may play a key role for parasite establishment; moreover, the microbiome may change in response to invading parasites. Hypothesis testing at the organismal level may be hampered, particularly in mammalian definitive hosts, by ethical, logistical, and economical restrictions. Thus, invertebrates naturally serving as intermediate hosts to parasites with complex life cycles may inform the development of mammalian models as an early-stage host-parasite model. In addition, several important pathogens are vectored by insects, and insect gut microbiome-pathogen interactions may provide essential base-line knowledge, which may be used to control vectorborne pathogens. Here, we used the grain beetle, Tenebrio molitor, a host of the tapeworm Hymenolepis diminuta, to explore interactions between infection status and resident gut microbiota at two pre-determined time points (day two and seven) post infection. Using 16S/18S microbial profiling, we measured key parameters of the composition, relative abundance, and diversity of the host gut bacteriome and mycobiome. In addition, we quantified the systemic beetle immune response to infection by Phenoloxidase activity and hemocyte abundance. We found significant changes in the gut bacteriome and mycobiome in relation to infection status and beetle age. Thus, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria was significantly higher in the gut of infected beetles and driven mostly by an increased abundance of Acinetobacter. In addition, the mycobiome was less abundant in infected beetles but maintained higher Shannon diversity in infected compared with non-infected beetles. Beetles treated with a broad-spectrum antibiotic (Tetracycline) exhibited significantly reduced parasite establishment compared with the untreated control group, indicating that the host microbiome may greatly influence hatching of eggs and subsequent establishment of H. diminuta larvae. Our results suggest that experimental work using invertebrates may provide a platform for explorative studies of host-parasite-microbe interactions and their underlying mechanisms.">

        <span class="abst" title="Purpose:Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women across the globe. Despite concerted efforts to improve the prevailing treatment modalities, the overall prognosis of breast cancer remains unsatisfactory. Recently, antiproliferative activity of Brevilin A (Brv-A), a sesquiterpene lactone compound of Centipeda minima, has been unveiled in various cancer types. Here, we have explored anticancer activity of Brv-A in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells by targeting various pathways. Materials and Methods:Cell proliferation rate was determined by CCK-8 and clonogenic assay. Cellular morphological changes were observed under phase contrast microscope while calcein-AM and PI was used for live/dead assay. Cell cycle assay was performed by flow cytometry. Apoptotic cell percentage was determined by Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometric analysis. ROS generation and mitochondrial membrane potential were measured using commercially available kits while protein expression was measured by Western blotting. Results:In our study, Brv-A exerted antiproliferative effect through mitotic arrest at G2/M phase of cell cycle and induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Induction of apoptosis by Brv-A was found to be associated with ROS generation by targeting NOX2 and NOX3, mitochondrial dysfunction (MMP dissipation and Bcl-2 family proteins modulation), DNA fragmentation, JNK and p38 MAPK activation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by increasing Bip/GRP78, ATF4 and CHOP protein expressions and inhibition of STAT3 activation via decreased phosphorylation of JAK2 and SRC. Pretreatment of NAC, a ROS scavenger, partially reversed the aforesaid cellular events indicating ROS generation as the primary event to modulate cellular targets for induction of apoptosis. Besides, Brv-A has also been documented for inhibition of cell migration via decrease in COX-2 and MMP-2 expression. Conclusion:Taken together, Brv-A induces G2/M phase arrest, ROS-dependent apoptosis, ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and inhibits STAT3 activation in MCF-7 cells signifying it to be one of the potential anticancer therapeutics in future.">

Here, the anti-cancer effects of isoflavones isolated from M. ferruginea were evaluated in human ovarian cancer cells. We found that isoflavone ferrugone and 6,7-dimethoxy-3',4'-methylenedioxy-8-(3,3-dimethylallyl)isoflavone (DMI) had potent cytotoxic effects on human ovarian cancer cell A2780 and SKOV3. Ferrugone and DMI treatment increased the sub-G1 cell population in a dose-dependent manner in A2780 cells. The cytotoxic activity of ferrugone and DMI was associated with the induction of apoptosis, as shown by an increase in annexin V-positive cells. Z-VAD-fmk, a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, and z-DEVD-fmk, a caspase-3 inhibitor, significantly reversed both the ferrugone and DMI-induced apoptosis, suggesting that cell death stimulated by the isoflavones is mediated by caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. Additionally, ferrugone-induced apoptosis was found to be caspase-8-dependent, while DMI-induced apoptosis was caspase-9-dependent. Notably, DMI, but not ferrugone, increased the intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) attenuated the pro-apoptotic activity of DMI. These data suggest that DMI induced apoptotic cell death through the intrinsic pathway via ROS production, while ferrugone stimulated the extrinsic pathway in human ovarian cancer cells.">

Most of them were the village leaders and other local people who are knowledgeable about plants. After transect walks with knowledgeable local people, we used free listing, key informant interviews, and semi-structured interviews during the field work. Plants traditionally used by the Monpa were documented. Utilization frequency was used to assess the significance of each species, and the Cultural Importance index was used to estimate the cultural significance of the species in common. We also used the informant consensus factor (FIC) to determine the homogeneity of the informants' knowledge of medicinal plants.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;One hundred ninety-four plant species belonging to 82 families and 158 genera were recorded and collected. One hundred twenty-two species, primarily fruits, were food plants. Forty-five species were used as traditional medicines. This included highly valued species collected in alpine areas (Paris polyphylla) and brought to villages in Mêdog, which are at a lower altitude (between 728 and 1759 m a.s.l). Seven edible plant species were also used as herbal medicines. We also recorded 39 species used for other purposes in Monpa daily life. These included nine species that were used to make agricultural tools, five species for dyes and mordants, four species for timber, three species for fuelwood, four species for religious ritual use, three species for washing, two species for incense, two species for thatching, two species for fiber (rope and paper), two &quot;calendar plants&quot; were used to indicate seasons for agricultural purposes, two fish poison plant species, and one species were used as a tobacco substitute. Based on taxonomic insights and from studies elsewhere, we suggested that fiber species were under-reported (c. 14 species were used vs. one species reported used). Even though these plant species are rich and diverse, the use of endemic or near-endemic species was rarely recorded in previous studies. These species included Arenga micrantha (used for starch), Hornstedtia tibetica (fruits), Castanopsis clarkei (edible nuts) and Gnetum pendulum (edible nuts), Ophiorrhiza medogensis (vegetables), Derris scabricaulis (fish poison), Radermachera yunnanensis (agricultural tools), Litsea tibetana (seed oil), Dendrocalamus tibeticus (wine strainers and implements for administering medicine), Zanthoxylum motuoense (spices), Cinnamomum contractum (tobacco substitutes), Morus wittiorum (medicines), and Garcinia nujiangensis (funeral rituals). Despite the absence of roads until 2013 and the impression of &quot;isolation,&quot; Monpa knowledge of plant use reflects three categories of change. Firstly, oral histories of plants used in Bhutan were also encountered by Monpa people after their migration from Bhutan to south-eastern Tibet. Secondly, a &quot;slow change&quot; through centuries of exchange of knowledge (for example of Chinese and Tibetan medical systems), seeds of introduced crops (finger millet (indigenous to Africa), maize (from Meso-America)), and experimentation and use of introduced medicinal plants (such as Datura stramonium, which originates from North America). Thirdly, &quot;fast change&quot; over the past decade. This is reflected in changes in traditional architecture and in rising commercial trade in selected plant resources such as Dendrobium orchid stems and Paris polyphylla rhizomes which are in demand in China's Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) markets).&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Monpa people in the south-eastern Tibet have detailed knowledge of the diverse plant resources. But that traditional knowledge is now faced with a crisis because of the modern socio-economic change. In addition, Monpa knowledge of plants reflects slower changes in knowledge as well. For example, Monpa ethnomedicine has been influenced by traditional Tibetan and Chinese medicine over a longer period in time. Overall, this study provides a deeper understanding of the Monpa peoples' knowledge on wild plants, including endemic and near-endemic species whose uses have not been previously recorded. Several of these narrowly distributed species, such as the fish poison Derris scabricaulis, could be the focus of further studies. Some wild edible plants may also have interesting dietary constituents which need in-depth studies. These detailed studies could enable the Monpa people to benefit from the use of their traditional plant-derived culture and therefore support the biodiversity conservation.">

The anthelmintic study was carried out to determine the time to paralysis and time to death of worms using three doses (100, 200, and 300 mg/mL) of ILE. Also, Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion susceptibility method was used to determine the antimicrobial activity of ILE. The results showed that ILE induces paralysis and death of &lt;i&gt;A. caliginosa&lt;/i&gt; at all concentration tested faster than the reference drug, Albendazole. Additionally, ILE exhibited prominent antimicrobial activity against all gram-positive bacteria tested but almost no significant activity against the gram-negative bacteria, except &lt;i&gt;K. pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;. ILE showed close similarity to the spectrum of chloramphenicol and cefoxitin activities. Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;C. albicans&lt;/i&gt; was highly susceptible to the leaf extracts.

        <span class="abst" title="Background: Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a global zoonotic parasitic disease caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus and it has been reported from both livestock and humans in Pakistan. The definitive host of E. granulosus is the dog, and the large number of stray dogs in Pakistan contributes to the spread of CE. However, there is little information between stray dogs and CE relation in the country. Methods: During the study, total 123 butcher's shops and abattoirs were included for collection of data relating to the hydatid cyst prevalence in slaughtered animals (sheep, goat, cattle, and buffaloes). The number of animals slaughtered in each butcher's shop during sampling period was also recorded, and the association of the shop environment with dogs was inspected. Results: Data was collected for CE from 123 butcher's shops in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, Pakistan. The slaughtering rate the in the butcher's shops was 2-10 animals/day including sheep/goat/cattle and buffaloes. The overall prevalence of CE in all examined animals was 2.77%. In buffaloes the higher prevalence was recorded as compared to other hosts. The findings showed that lung and liver were most affected organs and majority (59%) of the cysts were fertile in infected animals. The presence of a large number of stray dogs were an important factor in the spread of CE. They were rarely vaccinated, have easy access to infected offal at slaughtering site and had insufficient or inappropriate anthelmintic treatment. Conclusions: The most pressing need is to raise public awareness of this huge problem by considering CE a major ailment and promoting the collection and mapping of epidemiological data. Efficient CE control is required, especially treating dogs with antiparasitic drugs, for which government support and affiliation with the veterinary sector is essential.">

The aim of this study was to assess the geographical use of anthelminthic medicinal plants in livestock in European Union (EU), and to quantify the anthelminthic efficacy of medicinal plants in comparison with anthelminthic drugs. Surveys on the use of anthelminthic traditional medicinal plants in livestock in the EU were included in the qualitative synthesis. Studies that investigated the efficacy of anthelminthic traditional medicinal plants in animals, compared with negative control and/or anthelminthic drugs, were included in the quantitative synthesis (network meta-analysis). Twelve surveys (9 in Italy, 2 in Spain, 1 in Austria) reported the use of anthelminthic medicinal plants in livestock living in EU Countries. Data obtained from 256 animals and extracted from 6 studies were included in the network meta-analysis. Medicinal plants and drugs were more effective than negative control (standardized mean difference [SMD]: -0.60 95%CrI -0.88 to -0.31, -0.73 95%CrI -1.08 to -0.38, respectively, P &lt; 0.001). Overall, no difference was detected between anthelminthic medicinal plants and anthelminthic drugs, namely albendazole, ivermectin, fenbendazole, and doramectin (SMD: 0.26 95%CrI -0.02 to 0.55, P &gt; 0.05). The most effective anthelminthic medicinal plants were Artemisia absintihium, Allium sativum, and Duranta erecta. There is the strong medical need of performing adequately powered randomized controlled trials in different livestock species aimed to improve the quality of the current evidence concerning the anthelminthic efficacy of medicinal plants compared to that of the currently available antiparasitic drugs.">

From these plants, saponin mixtures were extracted, purified and used at scalar concentrations to evaluate their anthelmintic activities against sheep gastrointestinal strongyles (GISs), by the egg hatch test. Treated and untreated controls were used as the comparison. Data were statistically analyzed, and EC50 and EC90 were also calculated. All saponins and prosapogenins showed inhibiting effects on GIS eggs in a concentration-dependent manner. At higher concentrations, most of them showed an efficacy comparable to the reference drug (Thiabendazole 3 µg/mL) (P &lt; 0.001). With 1.72 mg/mL EC50 and 3.84 mg/mL EC90, saponin from M. polymorpha cultivars Anglona was the most active.

Especially, the unique chemical and physical properties make them as the promising candidates in drug target identification, unfortunately, little is known about their application in parasites. In this paper, GNPs were employed as new solid support to identify drug targets of natural bioactive compound arctigenin (ARG) against fish monogenean parasite Gyrodactylus kobayashi. Before target identification, GNPs with ARG on the surface showed the ability to enter the live parasites even the nucleus or mitochondria, which made the bound compounds capable of contacting directly with target proteins located anywhere of the parasites. At the same time, chemically modified compound remained the anthelminthic efficacy against G. kobayashii. The above results both provide assurance on the reliability of using GNPs for drug target-binding specificity. Subsequently, by interrogating the cellular proteome in parasite lysate, myosin-2 and UNC-89 were identified as the potential direct target proteins of ARG in G. kobayashii. Moreover, results of RNA-seq transcriptomics and iTRAQ proteomics indicated that myosin-2 expressions were down-regulated after ARG bath treatment both in transcript and protein levels, but for UNC-89, only in mRNA level. Myosin-2 is an important structural muscle protein expressed in helminth tegument and its identification as our target will enable further inhibitor optimization towards future drug discovery. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate the power of GNPs to be readily applied to other parasite drugs of unknown targets, facilitating more broadly therapeutic drug design in any pathogen or disease model.">

        <span class="abst" title="While scientific advances have led to large-scale production and widespread distribution of vaccines and antiviral drugs, viruses still remain a major cause of human diseases today. The ever-increasing reports of viral resistance and the emergence and re-emergence of viral epidemics pressure the health and scientific community to constantly find novel molecules with antiviral potential. This search involves numerous different approaches, and the use of antimicrobial peptides has presented itself as an interesting alternative. Even though the number of antimicrobial peptides with antiviral activity is still low, they already show immense potential to become pharmaceutically available antiviral drugs. Such peptides can originate from natural sources, such as those isolated from mammals and from animal venoms, or from artificial sources, when bioinformatics tools are used. This review aims to shed some light on antimicrobial peptides with antiviral activities against human viruses and update the data about the already well-known peptides that are still undergoing studies, emphasizing the most promising ones that may become medicines for clinical use.">

        <span class="abst" title="Angelicae Pubescentis Radix (APR) is a widely used antirheumatic Chinese medicinal herb known as &quot;Duhuo&quot; in China. It has the effects of dispelling wind and removing dampness, diffusing impediment, and relieving pain, and is mainly indicated for rheumatic arthritis with pain in the lower back and knees, and headache. To the best of our knowledge, an attempt is made to provide an up-to-date review on these aspects based on published materials, including ancient and modern books; Master's and doctoral theses; monographs on medicinal plants; the pharmacopoeia of different countries, websites for publication of patent and electronic databases, such as SCI finder, PubMed, Web of Science, ACS, Science Direct, Wiley, Springer, Taylor, CNKI, and Google Scholar. APR, which has a good clinical effect, has been used for traditional Chinese medicine more than 2000 years. Since 1957, a variety of chemical constituents have been reported from the medicinal plants of this herb, mostly coumarins and volatile oil. In the past 30 years, numerous studies have shown that the extracts and compounds isolated from APR showed effective analgesic and anti-inflammatory actions, also showing well effects on central nervous system, effects on cardiovascular system and deworming activity. In addition, we also present and discuss the botany, traditional medicinal use, pharmacokinetics, toxicity, quality control, future trends and prospects of APR. All this information suggest that future research of APR should be supplemented in the area of pharmacology and toxicology to provide further insight on the clinical use and quality control.">

Given its rich biodiversity, soil is also a major source for natural product drug discovery from soil microorganisms. However, the study of the soil small molecule profile has been challenging due to the complexity and heterogeneity of this matrix. In this study, we implemented high-resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and large-scale data analysis tools such as molecular networking to characterize the relative contributions of city, state and regional processes on backyard soil metabolite composition, in 188 soil samples collected from 14 USA States, representing five USA climate regions. We observed that region, state and city of collection all influence the overall soil metabolite profile. However, many metabolites were only detected in unique sites, indicating that uniquely local phenomena also influence the backyard soil environment, with both human-derived and naturally-produced (plant-derived, microbially-derived) metabolites identified. Overall, these findings are helping to define the processes that shape the backyard soil metabolite composition, while also highlighting the need for expanded metabolomic studies of this complex environment.">

This is partly true for Taenia solium taeniasis/cysticercosis, the most important foodborne parasitic infection. Despite substantial progress, adequate monitoring and surveillance (M&amp;S) are required to sustain a status of control/elimination. This is often lacking, especially for T. solium. Therefore, the objective was to conduct a systematic literature review of the currently available M&amp;S systems at the control/elimination stage of the four top-ranked helminth NTDs. Specifically, Taenia spp., Echinococcus spp., Schistosoma spp., and soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) were considered to determine if there are any similarities between their M&amp;S systems and whether certain approaches can be adopted from each other. The systematic review demonstrated that rigorous M&amp;S systems have been designed for the control/elimination stage of both STHs and schistosomiasis, particularly in China. On the other hand, a concept of M&amp;S for Taenia spp. and Echinococcus spp. has not been fully developed yet, due to a lack of epidemiological data and the fact that many endemic countries are far away from reaching control/elimination. Moreover, accurate diagnostic tools for all four diseases are still imperfect, which complicates proper M&amp;S. Finally, there is an urgent need to develop and harmonize/standardize M&amp;S activities in order to reliably determine and compare the epidemiological situation worldwide.">

The current paper is aimed at providing an overview of uses, toxicology, pharmacological properties and phytochemistry of &lt;i&gt;Z. mucronata&lt;/i&gt;. The information used in the current work was retrieved using various search engines, including Pubmed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, Scielo, SciFinder and Scopus. The key words used included &lt;i&gt;Ziziphus mucronata&lt;/i&gt;, secondary metabolites, chemistry, biological activity and pharmacology, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, ethnobotanical survey, medicinal uses, safety, toxicology and other related words. Out of the 46 infections which the plant species is used to treat, the most common uses includes sexually transmitted infections, skin infections, diarrhoea and dysentery, respiratory and chest complaints and gynaecological complaints (citations ≥6). Pharmacologically, the plant species exhibited a potential antimicrobial activity yielding a minimum inhibitory concentration of &lt;1 mg/ml against important pathogens which includes &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Moraxella catarrhalis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Propionibacterium acnes&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cryptoccoos neoformans&lt;/i&gt; amongst other microorganisms. Furthermore, the extracts and compounds from &lt;i&gt;Z mucronata&lt;/i&gt; revealed potent antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and other activities &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Phytochemically, cyclo-peptide alkaloids (commonly called mucronines) dominates and in conjunction with triterpenes, flavonoids, phenolic acids and anthocyanins. Besides these compounds, the plant species exhibited the presence of important in minerals. These phytoconstituents may well explain the reported biological activities. Although the extracts revealed no cytotoxic effect to Vero cells, further toxicological characteristics of the plant species still needs to be explored. There is also a need to carry out the comprehensive safety profiles of the plant species, including heavy metal detection. Although the plant species revealed important biological activities, which includes antimicrobial, antiviral, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-plasmodial, anthelmintic, and anti-anaemic activity &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, further research is needed to explore the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies, other compounds responsible for such activities and the mechanisms of action thereof. Such activities validates the use of the plant species in traditional medicine. The data on the possible use of the plant species in the treatment of diarrhoea, sexually transmitted infections, skin related and gynaecological complaints are scant and still needs to be explored and validated both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, the anticancer and anthelmintic activity of the plant species also needs to be explored.">

In the absence of vaccines for human intestinal nematodes, control of infections currently relies mainly on chemotherapy, but resistance is an increasing problem. Thus, there is an urgent need for the discovery and development of new anthelmintic drugs, especially ones with novel mechanisms of action. Medicinal plants hold great promise as a source of effective treatments, including anthelmintic therapy. They have been used traditionally for centuries and are mostly safe (if not, their toxicity is well-known). However, in most medicinal plants the compounds active against nematodes have not been identified thus far. The free-living nematode C. elegans was demonstrated to be an excellent model system for the discovery of new anthelmintics and for characterizing their mechanism of action or resistance. The compounds discussed in this review are of botanical origin and were published since 2002. Most of them need further studies of their toxicity, mechanisms and structure-activity relationship to assess more fully their potential as drugs.">

This vegetation is represented by some species of herbaceous or woody plants, annual or perennial, that spontaneously invade the agricultural lands, diminishing the production capacity of the cultivated plants. Included in this category are 10 meadow weeds, without fodder value or even toxic to animals: Arctium lappa L., Carduus nutans L., Conium maculatum L., Eryngium campestre L., Euphorbia cyparissias L., Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn, Rumex acetosella L., Veratrum album L., Xanthium spinosum L., and Xanthium strumarium L. Various and multiple uses in traditional medicine of these meadow weed species have been reported for Romania and other nine neighboring East European countries, i.e. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Kosovo, Russia, Turkey, Serbia, and Ukraine. For A. lappa were recorded the highest number of ethnomedicinal uses, in the largest number of East European countries, including Romania. C. maculatum and V. album are not recommended for human consumption but can be further investigated as potential sources of pharmaceutically active compounds. Once removed by landowners and farmers from their land, the raw plant material of these 10 species become readily and easily available to the Romanian local communities and the industry of herbal food supplements, while the biodiversity of the agro-ecosystems is maintained.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background:Infections by microbes (viruses, bacteria, and fungi) and parasites can cause serious diseases in both humans and animals. Heavy use of antimicrobials has created selective pressure and caused resistance to currently available antibiotics, hence the need for finding new and better antibiotics. Natural products, especially from plants, are known for their medicinal properties, including antimicrobial and anthelmintic activities. Geoclimatic variation, together with diversity in ethnomedicinal traditions, has made the Himalayas of Nepal an invaluable repository of traditional medicinal plants. We studied antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, and anthelmintic activities of medicinal plants, selected based upon ethnobotanical evidence. Methods:Ethanolic and methanolic extracts were tested (1) on a panel of microbes: two Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria innocua), four Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, and Shigella sonnei), and one fungal species: Candida albicans; (2) against three different viruses: yellow fever, chikungunya, and enterovirus; and (3) on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Also, cytotoxicity was assessed on human hepatoma (Huh), rhabdosarcoma (RD), and Vero (VC) cell lines. Results:Of 18 plants studied, Ampelocissus tomentosa and Aleuritopteris anceps inhibited S. aureus (MIC 35 μg/mL and 649 μg/mL, respectively) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC 15 μg/mL and 38 μg/mL, respectively). Rhododendron arboreum and Adhatoda vasica inhibited S. enterica (MIC 285 μg/mL and 326 μg/mL, respectively). Kalanchoe pinnata, Ampelocissus tomentosa, and Paris polyphylla were active against chikungunya virus, and Clerodendrum serratum was active against yellow fever virus (EC50 15.9 μg/mL); Terminalia chebula was active against enterovirus (EC50 10.6 μg/mL). Ampelocissus tomentosa, Boenninghausenia albiflora, Dichrocephala integrifolia, and Kalanchoe pinnata significantly reduced C. elegans motility, comparable to levamisole. Conclusions:In countries like Nepal, with a high burden of infectious and parasitic diseases, and a current health system unable to combat the burden of diseases, evaluation of local plants as a treatment or potential source of drugs can help expand treatment options. Screening plants against a broad range of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites) will support bioprospecting in Nepal, which may eventually lead to new drug development.">

In such settings, highly sensitive diagnostics are needed to detect STH infection. We compared double-slide Kato-Katz, the most commonly used copromicroscopic detection method, to multi-parallel quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in 2,799 stool samples from children aged 2-12 years in a setting in rural Bangladesh with predominantly low STH infection intensity. We estimated the sensitivity and specificity of each diagnostic using Bayesian latent class analysis. Compared to double-slide Kato-Katz, STH prevalence using qPCR was almost 3-fold higher for hookworm species and nearly 2-fold higher for Trichuris trichiura. Ascaris lumbricoides prevalence was lower using qPCR, and 26% of samples classified as A. lumbricoides positive by Kato-Katz were negative by qPCR. Amplicon sequencing of the 18S rDNA from 10 samples confirmed that A. lumbricoides was absent in samples classified as positive by Kato-Katz and negative by qPCR. The sensitivity of Kato-Katz was 49% for A. lumbricoides, 32% for hookworm, and 52% for T. trichiura; the sensitivity of qPCR was 79% for A. lumbricoides, 93% for hookworm, and 90% for T. trichiura. Specificity was ≥ 97% for both tests for all STH except for Kato-Katz for A. lumbricoides (specificity = 68%). There were moderate negative, monotonic correlations between qPCR cycle quantification values and eggs per gram quantified by Kato-Katz. While it is widely assumed that double-slide Kato-Katz has few false positives, our results indicate otherwise and highlight inherent limitations of the Kato-Katz technique. qPCR had higher sensitivity than Kato-Katz in this low intensity infection setting.">

Hydroalcoholic and petroleum ether extracts were prepared by maceration and soxhlet respectively. Both extracts with four different concentrations (100, 10, 1, 0.1 mg/ml) were incubated against protoscoleces in 5, 15, 30 and 60 min. Results:Maximum mortality was 16% with 1% hydroalcoholic extract in 60 min. The highest mortality with organic extract was 4% with 10% concentration in 60 min (P=0.015). Conclusion:Since highest mortality was 16%, the extract did not reach to LD50 (50% mortality). Therefore, the potency of the total extract is not sufficient as potential scolicidal drug.">

Preliminary phytochemical investigation showed the presence of alkaloids, saponins, and reducing sugars of glycosides present in all the crude extracts of &lt;i&gt;Carica papaya&lt;/i&gt;. Tannins were observed only in extracts of the leaves, while fixed oils were only present in the extracts of the seeds. The results of the anthelminthic activity testing indicated that all crude extracts prepared were more effective than albendazole in reducing paralysis time (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.0001) and death time (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.0001). It was further shown that the extracts from the seeds (SE and SHE) were more effective than the extracts from the stem bark and leaves both in reducing paralysis and death times. Fractionation of SE provided a fraction, SE&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, which was more effective than SE both in reducing paralysis and death times (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.0001) and was established to contain fixed oils. The outcome of the current study has provided a scientific justification for the preference of the seeds of &lt;i&gt;Carica papaya&lt;/i&gt; for the treatment of helminth infections and has shown that the fixed oils present in the seeds could be responsible for such activity.">

Prosopis laevigata is a plant used as a home remedy against many diseases in Mexico. This study arose from a preliminary study where a P. laevigata hydroalcoholic extract (Pl-hae) showed anthelmintic activity (aa) against H. contortus. Searching for bioactive compounds (bac) with high aa, the Pl-hae was fractioned obtaining an aqueous (Aq-F) and an ethyl acetate fraction (EtAc-F), and a flavonoid with aa identified as isorhamnetin was obtained from EtAc-F. Both fractions were in vitro assessed by the egg hatch test (eht) and larval mortality (lm) assays. The bac obtained from EtAc-F were characterised by NMR analysis. The highest aa were recorded with EtAc-F, resulting in 100% eht and 80.45% lm at 0.75 and 30 mg/mL, respectively. Alterations in eggs and larvae attributed to isorhamnetin were recorded by environmental scanning electron microscopy, confocal laser scanning and by high-resolution digital-coupled camera. This flavonoid caused 100% eht at 0.07 mg/mL after 48 h and 100% lm at 7.5 mg/mL after 72 h exposure. Isorhamnetin has promising potential as an anthelmintic against sheep haemonchosis.">

Folklore suggests benefits on gastrointestinal functions but with little supporting evidence. BEO and major constituents (linalool, limonene, linalyl acetate) were therefore examined for any ability to influence neuromuscular contractions of human and rat colon. Circular muscle strips (macroscopically-normal human colon obtained following ethical approval at cancer surgery; Sprague-Dawley rats) were suspended in baths (Krebs solution; 37 °C; 5% CO2 in O2) for measurement of neuronally-mediated contractions (prevented by tetrodotoxin or atropine) evoked by electrical field stimulation (5 Hz, 0.5 ms pulse width, 10s/minute, maximally-effective voltage), or contractions evoked by KCl (submaximally-effective concentrations). BEO and each constituent concentration dependently inhibited neuronally-mediated and KCl-induced contractions. In human: apparent pIC50 for BEO (volume/volume Krebs), respectively, 3.8 ± 0.3 and 4.4 ± 0.3; Imax 55.8% ± 4.2% and 37.5% ± 4.2%. For the constituents, the rank order of potency differed in human (linalool &gt; limonene &gt;&gt; linalyl-acetate) and rat colon (linalyl-acetate &gt; limonene = linalool), but rank order of efficacy was similar (linalool &gt;&gt; (BEO) = linalyl-acetate &gt;&gt; limonene). Thus, linalool had high efficacy but greater potency in human colon (Imax 76.8% ± 6.9%; pIC50 6.7 ± 0.2; n = 4) compared with rat colon (Imax 75.3% ± 1.9%; pIC50 5.8 ± 0.1; n = 4).

Annually, up to 30 million people are affected by either Chagas disease, African trypansomiasis or leishmaniasis, and more than 200 million by malaria. Most of the currently available drugs have drawbacks in terms of toxicity, limited oral availability, development of resistance, or non-affordability. Tropical plants of the arid zones are a treasure chest for the discovery of bioactive secondary metabolites. This study aims to compile Sudanese medicinal plants, validate their antiprotozoal activities, and identify active molecules. We have performed a survey of medicinal plants of Sudan and selected 62 that are being used in Sudanese traditional medicine. From these, we collected materials such as leaves, stem, bark, or fruit. The plant materials were extracted in 70% ethanol and further fractionated by liquid-liquid partitioning using solvents of increasing polarity. This resulted in a library of 235 fractions. The library was tested &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; against &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; (erythrocytic stages), &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense&lt;/i&gt; (bloodstream forms), &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma cruzi&lt;/i&gt; (intracellular amastigotes), and &lt;i&gt;Leishmania donovani&lt;/i&gt; (axenic amastigotes). Active fractions were also tested for cytotoxicity. Of the 235 fractions, 125 showed growth inhibitory activity &gt;80% at 10 μg/ml, and &gt;50% at 2 μg/ml against at least one of the protozoan parasites. &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; was the most sensitive of the parasites, followed by &lt;i&gt;T. b. rhodesiense&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L. donovani&lt;/i&gt;. Only few hits were identified for &lt;i&gt;T. cruzi&lt;/i&gt;, and these were not selective. Contrary to expectation based on phylogeny, but in agreement with previous results, a large number of extracts displayed mutual activity against &lt;i&gt;T. brucei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P. falciparum&lt;/i&gt;. HPLC-based activity profiling for selected active extracts was performed to identify the bioactive principles. Active compounds identified by dereplication were guieranone A from &lt;i&gt;Guiera senegalensis&lt;/i&gt; J.F.Gmel.; pseudosemiglabrin from &lt;i&gt;Tephrosia apollinea&lt;/i&gt; (Delile) DC; ellagic acid and quercetin from &lt;i&gt;Terminalia leiocarpa&lt;/i&gt; (DC.) Baill.; and catechin, ethyl gallate, and epicatechin gallate from &lt;i&gt;Vachellia nilotica&lt;/i&gt; (L.) P.J.H.Hurter &amp; Mabb. Also the extracts of &lt;i&gt;Croton gratissimus&lt;/i&gt; var. &lt;i&gt;gratissimus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Cuscuta hyalina&lt;/i&gt; Roth ex Schult. exhibited promising antitrypanosomatid activity. This assessment provides a comprehensive overview of Sudanese medicinal plants and supports the notion that they are a potential source of bioactive molecules against protozoan parasites.">

Moreover, several local herbal remedies used by sub-Saharan African pregnant women have never been botanically identified. In this review, an overview of the practice of herbal medicine, including the regulations, challenges and overall safety, is provided.

Almost 75.0% of the self-medicated women used medicines classified as probably safe and 13.6% as potentially risky to use during pregnancy. Medicinal plant use, religion and access to a health facility near their residency were significantly associated with self-medication during pregnancy.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Self-medication is common among pregnant women at JUMC. Most women used medicines classified as safe to use during pregnancy. There is need for enlightenment of pregnant women on the potential dangers of self-medication during pregnancy to prevent foetal and maternal risks.">

The progression of fibrosis is very complex and reputed irreversible once established. Although some preventive options are being reported, therapeutic options are still scarce and in very high demand, given the rise of diseases linked to fibroproliferative disorders. Our work explored four platforms, complementarily, in order to screen preventive and therapeutic potentials of the antiparasitic drug Praziquantel as a possible antifibrotic. We applied the mouse CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-driven liver fibrosis model, the mouse chronic schistosomiasis liver fibrosis model, as well as novel 2D and 3D human cell-based co-culture of human hepatocytes, KCs (Kupffer cells), LECs (Liver Endothelial Cells), HSCs (Hepatic Stellate Cells) and/or myofibroblasts to mimic in vivo fibrotic responses and dynamics. Praziquantel showed some effect on fibrosis marker when preventively administered before severe establishment of fibrosis. However, it failed to potently reverse already established fibrosis. Together, we provided a novel sophisticated multi-assay screening platform to test preventive and therapeutic antifibrotic candidates. We further demonstrated a direct preventive potential of Praziquantel against the onset of fibrosis and the confirmation of its lack of therapeutic potential in reversing already established fibrosis.">

The biosynthesis of 2,4-DAPG is strictly regulated by the RsmA family proteins RsmA and RsmE. However, mutation of both of rsmA and rsmE genes results in reduced bacterial growth.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;In this study, we showed that overproduction of 2,4-DAPG in the rsmA rsmE double mutant influenced the growth of strain 2P24. This delay of growth could be partially reversal when the phlD gene was deleted or overexpression of the phlG gene encoding the 2,4-DAPG hydrolase in the rsmA rsmE double mutant. RNA-seq analysis of the rsmA rsmE double mutant revealed that a substantial portion of the P. fluorescens genome was regulated by RsmA family proteins. These genes are involved in the regulation of 2,4-DAPG production, cell motility, carbon metabolism, and type six secretion system.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;These results suggest that RsmA and RsmE are the important regulators of genes involved in the plant-associated strain 2P24 ecologic fitness and operate a sophisticated mechanism for fine-tuning the concentration of 2,4-DAPG in the cells.">

It seriously affects the development of animal husbandry and endangers human health. Due to a poor understanding of the cystic fluid formation pathway, there is currently a lack of innovative methods for the prevention and treatment of CE. In this study, the protoscoleces (PSCs) in the encystation process were analyzed by high-throughput RNA sequencing. A total of 32,401 transcripts and 14,903 cDNAs revealed numbers of new genes and transcripts, stage-specific genes, and differently expressed genes. Genes encoding proteins involved in signaling pathways, such as putative G-protein coupled receptor, tyrosine kinases, and serine/threonine protein kinase, were predominantly up-regulated during the encystation process. Antioxidant enzymes included cytochrome c oxidase, thioredoxin glutathione, and glutathione peroxidase were a high expression level. Intriguingly, KEGG enrichment suggested that differentially up-regulated genes involved in the vasopressin-regulated water reabsorption metabolic pathway may play important roles in the transport of proteins, carbohydrates, and other substances. These results provide valuable information on the mechanism of cystic fluid production during the encystation process, and provide a basis for further studies on the molecular mechanisms of growth and development of PSCs.">

        <span class="abst" title="Over the past few decades, among equine parasitoses caused by gastrointestinal nematodes, habronematidosis has been discontinuously studied worldwide. Habronematidosis is a parasitic disease distributed all over the world. It is caused by &lt;i&gt;Habronema microstoma, Habronema muscae&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Draschia megastoma&lt;/i&gt; (Spirurida, Habronematidae), and it is maintained in the environment by muscid flies which act as intermediate hosts. At larval and adult stages these species live in the stomach of domestic and wild equids. However, the larvae can also be found on the skin, causing lesions known as &quot;summer sores&quot;, and occasionally on other body areas, such as ocular and genital mucosa (muco-cutaneous habronematidosis) and lung, liver, brain parenchyma. Depending on the parasite's developmental stage and localization site, clinical signs vary from mild to severe. Habronematidosis is responsible for significant economic losses, mostly when sport horses are affected, because their performances are impaired and the infection can be unaesthetic. We used three on-line databases for searching the articles on habronematidosis according to the selected inclusion criteria; a total of 250 contributions, published between 1911 and 2020 were analyzed. This review summarizes the key features of pathogenesis, epizootiology, diagnosis, treatment, and control of habronematidosis, and highlights the current knownledge about its geographical distribution and spread. Anthelmintic drugs are the most widely-used tools against habronematidosis; given the known risk of anthelmintic resistance in some nematodes affecting horses, this aspect should also be explored for habronematidosis. Dedicated research is essential to fill gaps of knowledge and increase the understanding of habronematidosis to maximize equine health, reduce economic losses and sanitary impact associated with this parasitic infection.">

However, death counts are still rising. Some nations have managed to &quot;flatten&quot; the death rate via protective measures such physical distancing, quarantine measures, and therapeutic management. The structure of the SARS-CoV-2 virus comprises of S proteins, M proteins, E proteins, hemagglutinin esterases, nucleocapsid proteins, and a 30-kb RNA genome. Viral proteases cleave these polyproteins and RNA-dependent polymerases replicate the genome. Currently, there are no effective therapies against this new disease. Numerous investigators are developing novel protease inhibitors, some of which have made it into clinical trials. Researchers are also attempting to develop a vaccine.

Concerned with the scope of the available evidence, we designed a scoping review to critically analyze scientific evidence on P dodecandra's pharmacology, toxicity, and phytochemistry to validate its ethnomedical use. Methods:We searched without language restriction in MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science through December 2019. Both published and unpublished articles were assessed for relevance and reviewed. Results:Of 600 articles retrieved through database search, a total of 48 articles were finally included. The butanol extract of berries was more potent molluscicidal than aqueous extract. The berries had also miracidial, anthelmintic, antifungal activity, and antibacterial effect against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella spp. The methanol extracts of roots had an antifungal effect against Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Microsporum gypseum, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. Phytolacca dodecandra was toxic to aquatic invertebrate and fish. The fishes were up to 4 times more sensitive than snails. Saponins were the main phytoconstituent isolated from berries. Terpenoid and phenolic were abundant in leaves and bark extracts. Conclusions:Studies validated the traditional use of P dodecandra against snails, worms, and various bacterial and fungal infections. Limited phytochemical data call for future research to focus on isolation of compounds; test their toxicity and activity; and establish mechanism of action.">

        <span class="abst" title="Brucellosis is one of the world's most widespread bacterial zoonoses caused by Brucella. It leads to considerable economic losses as a result of low productivity of infected animals and the long debilitating illness in humans. Despite its impact on human and animal health, little attention has been paid on Brucella infections in domestic animals. It is in this light that the prevalence of Brucella antibodies was determined in domestic animals with the overarching goal of improving our knowledge on brucellosis in southern Cameroon. During cross-sectional studies conducted from December 2016 to August 2018 in five sites of southern Cameroon, blood samples were collected in cattle, sheep, goat, pig and dog. Plasma was obtained from each blood sample and Brucella antibodies were detected using the Rose Bengal test and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). From 1873 animals that were sampled, the overall prevalence of Brucella antibodies using Indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (i-ELISA) was 6.35% (118/1873): 9.12% (78/855) in cattle; 8.04% (30/373) in sheep; 6.06% (2/33) in dog, 1.87% (3/160) in pig and 1.1% (5/452) in goat. Between animal species (p-value &lt; .0001, x2  = 33.63) as well as sampling sites (p-value = .0001, x2  = 18.97), significant differences were observed in the prevalence of Brucella antibodies. Yoko and Noun localities have shown the highest prevalence of 8.6% (30/348) and 7.2% (78/1070), respectively. This prevalence was significantly higher (p = .03, x2  = 1.25) in female than male cattle. Between adult (16.923%) and young cattle (7.8%), significant difference (p = .04, x2  = 6.42) was observed in the prevalence of Brucella antibodies. This study shows that the prevalence of Brucella antibodies varies between animal species and localities. It also shows several domestic animals of southern Cameroon that have been in contact with Brucella. It enabled to identify villages where investigations on the transmission dynamic must be focused for the final goal of developing control measures for this neglected zoonotic disease.">

The identification of this nematode is seldom performed and relies on egg characterization at the coproscopy, in the absence of any molecular tool. Following the recovery of two adult females of &lt;i&gt;A. caucasica&lt;/i&gt; from the feces of wild Senegalese chimpanzees, morphometric characteristics were reported and new data on the width of the esophagus (0.268-0.287 mm) and on the cuticle structure (0.70-0.122 mm) were provided. The molecular characterization of a set of mitochondrial (&lt;i&gt;cox&lt;/i&gt;1, 16S rRNA, 12S rRNA) and nuclear (18S rRNA and ITS2) partial genes was performed. Our phylogenetic analysis indicates for the first time that &lt;i&gt;A. caucasica&lt;/i&gt; is monophyletic with &lt;i&gt;Physaloptera&lt;/i&gt; species. A novel molecular tool was developed for the routine diagnosis of &lt;i&gt;A. caucasica&lt;/i&gt; and the surveillance of Nematoda infestations. An &lt;i&gt;A. caucasica&lt;/i&gt;-specific qPCR targeting the 12S gene was assessed. The assay was able to detect up to 1.13 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; eggs/g of fecal matter irrespective of its consistency, with an efficiency of 101.8% and a perfect adjustment (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.99). The infection rate by &lt;i&gt;A. caucasica&lt;/i&gt; in the chimpanzee fecal samples was 52.08%. Only 6.19% of the environmental samples were positive for nematode DNA and any for &lt;i&gt;A. caucasica&lt;/i&gt;. Our findings indicate the need for further studies to clarify the epidemiology, circulation, life cycle, and possible pathological effects of this infestation using the molecular tool herein developed.">

        <span class="abst" title="The quality of health care in Mesoamerica is influenced by its rich cultural diversity and characterized by social inequalities. Especially indigenous and rural communities confront diverse barriers to accessing formal health services, leading to often conflicting plurimedical systems. Fostering integrative medicine is a fundamental pillar for achieving universal health coverage (UHC) for marginalized populations. Recent developments toward health sovereignty in the region are concerned with assessing the role of traditional medicines, and particularly herbal medicines, to foster accessible and culturally pertinent healthcare provision models. In Mesoamerica, as in most regions of the world, a wealth of information on traditional and complementary medicine has been recorded. Yet these data are often scattered, making it difficult for policy makers to regulate and integrate traditionally used botanical products into primary health care. This critical review is based on a quantitative analysis of 28 survey papers focusing on the traditional use of botanical drugs in Mesoamerica used for the compilation of the &quot;Mesoamerican Medicinal Plant Database&quot; (MAMPDB), which includes a total of 12,537 use-records for 2188 plant taxa. Our approach presents a fundamental step toward UHC by presenting a pharmacological and toxicological review of the cross-culturally salient plant taxa and associated botanical drugs used in traditional medicine in Mesoamerica. Especially for native herbal drugs, data about safety and effectiveness are limited. Commonly used cross-culturally salient botanical drugs, which are considered safe but for which data on effectiveness is lacking constitute ideal candidates for treatment outcome studies.">

The present study was designed to explore the α-amylase inhibitory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activities of Polygonum hydropiper L. Polarity-based solvent extracts (n-hexane, acetone, chloroform, methanol, ethanol, and water) of Polygonum hydropiper leaves and stem were used. Antioxidant activity was assessed by free radical scavenging assay (FRAP) and 2,2-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging activity methods. Quantitative phytochemical analyses suggested that the stem of Polygonum hydropiper L. contains higher levels of bioactive compounds than its leaves (p &lt; 0.05). The results suggested that stem-derived extracts of Polygonum hydropiper L. are more active against bacterial species, including two Gram-positive and three Gram-negative strains. Moreover, our results showed that the bioactive compounds of Polygonum hydropiper L. significantly inhibit α-amylase activity. Finally, we reported the polarity-based solvent extracts of Polygonum hydropiper L. and revealed that the stem, rather than leaves, has a high antioxidant potential as measured by FRAP and DPPH assay with IC50 values of 1.38 and 1.59 mg/mL, respectively. It may also be deducted from the data that the Polygonum hydropiper L. could be a significant candidate, which should be subjected to further isolation and characterization, to be used as an antidiabetic, antimicrobial and antioxidant resource in many industries, like food, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.">

Extracts were tested at concentrations of 0.3, 0.6, 1.2, 2.5, 5.0, 10, 20, and 40 mg/mL. The larval exsheathment inhibition (LEI) results showed that G. sepium achieved the highest average inhibition of 91.2%, compared with 44.6% for P. dulce and 41.0% for L. leucocephala at a concentration of 40 mg/mL; the corresponding IC50 values were 22.4, 41.7, and 43.3 mg/mL, respectively. The rates of egg hatching inhibition (EHI) at a concentration of 5 mg/mL were 99.5% for G. sepium, 64.2% for P. dulce, and 54% for L. leucocephala; the corresponding IC50 values were 1.9 mg/mL for G. sepium, 3.9 mg/mL for P. dulce, and 4.3 mg/mL for L. leucocephala. The species extracts studied here were also analyzed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography and Orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q/Orbitrap/MS/MS), resulting in the compounds' identification associated with AA. Glycosylated flavonoids and methoxyphenols were observed in all three species: fatty acids in G. sepium and P. dulce; phenylpropanoids, anthraquinone glycosides, amino acids and glycosylated phenolic acids in G. sepium; and flavonoids in L. leucocephala. Comparatively, G. sepium presented a greater diversity of compounds potentially active against the control of gastrointestinal nematodes, which was associated with the results obtained in the applied tests.">

However, this standard classifies ethnomedicinal uses into categories based on local peoples' perception. It is difficult to apply in pharmacological research. The International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC), now updated to ICPC-2, is more related to medical terms, but is rarely used among ethnobotanists. This study aims to apply the ICPC-2 to classify metadata of the ethnomedicinal uses of Zingiberaceae plants in Thailand, in order to identify important medicinal taxa for future research. Data on the ethnomedicinal uses of Thai gingers were collected from 62 theses, journal articles, scientific reports and a book, published between 1990 and 2019. Scientific plant names were updated using The World Checklist of Vascular Plants (WCVP) website. Informant Consensus Factor (ICF) was used to identify the medicinal issues commonly treated with gingers, and the Cultural Importance Index (CI) was used to identify species that might have pharmacological potential. We found records of 76 ginger species with ethnomedicinal uses, and together they had 771 use reports. The gingers were commonly used for treatments related to digestive system conditions, particularly abdominal pain and flatulence. Gingers remain exceedingly important in Thai ethnomedicine, with a high number of useful species. They are used to treat a variety of health conditions, but most commonly such ones that are related to the digestive system. Apart from the popular studied ginger, &lt;i&gt;Curcuma longa&lt;/i&gt;, we identified a number of other useful gingers in Thailand.">

Many insects harbour actinobacteria on their bodies or in their nests and use these metabolites for protection. However, some actinobacteria produce metabolites that are toxic to insects and the evolutionary relevance of this toxicity is unknown. Here we explore chemical interactions between streptomycetes and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. We find that many streptomycetes produce specialized metabolites that have potent larvicidal effects against the fly; larvae that ingest spores of these species die. The mechanism of toxicity is specific to the bacterium's chemical arsenal: cosmomycin D producing bacteria induce a cell death-like response in the larval digestive tract; avermectin producing bacteria induce paralysis. Furthermore, low concentrations of volatile terpenes like 2-methylisoborneol that are produced by streptomycetes attract fruit flies such that they preferentially deposit their eggs on contaminated food sources. The resulting larvae are killed during growth and development. The phenomenon of volatile-mediated attraction and specialized metabolite toxicity suggests that some streptomycetes pose an evolutionary risk to insects in nature.">

Thrombolytic and anthelmintic activities were evaluated by using human blood serum and by recording paralysis and death time in earthworm, respectively. Cytotoxic activity was investigated in brine shrimp nauplii. Analgesic and antidiarrheal activities were evaluated in Swiss albino mice and neurological effect was evaluated by open field and Elevated plus-maze test (EPM).&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;All fractions (n-hexane, carbon tetrachloride and chloroform) possess significant (p&lt;0.05) cytotoxic activity. In case of thrombolytic activity, the highest concentration of methanolic extract produced a remarkable percentage of clot lysis (46.12%). The concentration of 1000 μg/ml produced a significant antibacterial activity against Gram positive &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; and Gram negative &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;. Aqueous fraction at a dose of 400 mg/kg body weight, was found to show promising analgesic activity. In case of antidiarrheal and anthelmintic activity, plant extract showed dose-dependent activity. Methanolic extract and its fractions failed to produce any neurological effect in both methods.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The overall results of the study tend to suggest that the methanolic extract and its fractions have promising pharmacological activities.">

The incidence rate is increasing dramatically worldwide with highest rates in Eastern and South Asian regions. Major risk factors involve chronic damage and inflammation of bile duct epithelium from primary sclerosing cholangitis, chronic hepatitis virus infection, gallstones and liver fluke infection. Various genetic variants have also been identified and as CCA develops on the background of biliary inflammation, diverse range of molecular mechanisms are involved in its progression. Among these, the Notch signalling pathway acts as a major driver of cholangiocarcinogenesis and its components (receptors, ligands and downstream signalling molecules) represent a promising therapeutic targets. Gamma-Secretase Inhibitors have been recognized in inhibiting the Notch pathway efficiently. A comprehensive knowledge of the molecular pathways activated by the Notch signalling cascade as well as its functional crosstalk with other signalling pathways provide better approach in developing innovative therapies against CCA.">

(Asteraceae) is the one which is frequently used to treat pain and inflammation by traditional healers in Ethiopian folk medicine. However, the plant has not been scientifically evaluated for its traditionally claimed use. The present study aimed at the investigation of analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities of 80% methanol root extract of &lt;i&gt;Echinops kebericho&lt;/i&gt; M. in mice model.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Successive maceration was used as a method of extraction using solvents of increasing polarity: methanol and water. After extraction of the roots with 80% hydro methanol, the crude extract was evaluated for its peripheral and central analgesic activities using acetic acid-induced writhing test and hot plate method, respectively, while its anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated using carrageenan- and formalin-induced paw edema. The extract was evaluated at 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg doses. The positive control groups were treated with ASA 150 mg/kg for writhing test, morphine 10 mg/kg for hot plat method, indomethacin 25 mg/kg and diclofenac 10 mg/kg for paw edema tests and vehicle, distilled water (10 mL/kg) treated mice were assigned as negative controls. All treatment administrations were performed orally.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;E. kebericho extract at all test doses showed statistically significant antinociceptive activity in both chemicals-induced peripheral and thermal-induced central pain in a dose dependent manner (p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.001). The greater analgesic activity was observed by the maximum dose of the extract (400 mg/kg) in both acetic acids-induced writhing test (57.84%) and hot plate method (69.40%). The effect of the extract was also statistically significant (p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.001) in both carrageenan and formalin-induced paw edema in dose dependent manner. Greater edema inhibition was observed by the highest dose (400 mg/kg) in both observations with the respective percentage values of 70.00% and 79.87%, respectively.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;In general, the data obtained from the present study elucidated that the extract possessed a significant analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities and recommended for further studies.">

Specifically, the eclosion inhibition of the methanolic extracts of the leaves and bark of &lt;i&gt;D. anisandra&lt;/i&gt; collected during the dry and rainy seasons (600-37.5 μg/ml) were evaluated in addition to the fractions, sub-fractions (300-37.5 μg/ml) and active major constituents (150-2.3 μg/ml). The rainy season bark extract had the highest percentage of eclosion inhibition (PEI) against the evaluated nematodes (≥ 90% at 75 μg/ml) along with high ovicidal activity (90.0 to 93.4% at 75 μg/ml). The purification of the rainy season bark extract showed that its biological activity came from the non-polar &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-hexane fraction (≥ 93% at 75 μg/ml). The bioguided fractionation pointed to sub-fraction 5 as having the highest anthelmintic activity against the three evaluated genera of nematodes (PEI ≥ 93% at 37.5 μg/ml). Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry revealed that the major constituent in sub-fraction 5 was plumbagin. Upon evaluation, plumbagin was confirmed to be responsible for the anthelmintic activity of &lt;i&gt;D. anisandra&lt;/i&gt;, with a PEI ≥ 90% at 2.3 μg/ml on the three evaluated nematodes. Additionally, the compounds betulin and lupeol in the bark of &lt;i&gt;D. anisandra&lt;/i&gt; were evaluated but presented low anthelmintic activity (PEI ≤ 5.3% at 2.3 μg/ml). In conclusion, the rainy season bark extract of &lt;i&gt;D. anisandra&lt;/i&gt; exerts a high ovicidal activity against the eggs of the three studied nematodes. Plumbagin is the active compound responsible for this activity and represents a potential alternative for the control of different genera of gastrointestinal nematodes given the current scenario of anthelmintic resistance.">

Synthetic anthelmintics are most commonly used to control CE, however, prolonged use of these drugs may result in many adverse effects. This study aims to discuss the in vitro/in vivo scolicidal efficacy of different medicinal plants and their components used against Echinococcus granulosus. Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, PubMed and Scopus were used to retrieve the published literature from 2000-2020. A total of 62 published articles met the eligibility criteria and were reviewed. A total of 52 plant species belonging to 22 families have been reported to be evaluated as scolicidal agents against E. granulosus worldwide. Most extensively used medicinal plants against E. granulosus belong to the family Lamiaceae (25.0%) followed by Apiaceae (11.3%). Among various plant parts, leaves (36.0%) were most commonly used. Essential oils of Zataria multiflora and Ferula asafetida at a concentration of 0.02, and 0.06 mg/ml showed 100% in vitro scolicidal activity after 10 min post application, respectively. Z. multiflora also depicted high in vivo efficacy by decreasing weight and size while also causing extensive damage to the germinal layer of the cysts. Plant-based compounds like berberine, thymol, and thymoquinone have shown high efficacy against E. granulosus. These plant species and compounds could be potentially used for the development of an effective drug against E. granulosus, if further investigated for in vivo efficacy, toxicity, and mechanism of drug action in future research.">

Despite mass drug administration (MDA) to school-aged children and other control measures, helminth infections are spreading into new areas. Thus, there is a strong rationale for developing anthelminthic vaccines as cost-effective, long-term immunological control strategies, which, unlike MDA, are not haunted by the threat of emerging drug-resistant helminths nor limited by reinfection risk. Advances in vaccinology, immunology, and immunomics include the development of new tools that improve the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of vaccines; and some of these tools have been used in the development of helminth vaccines. The development of anthelminthic vaccines is fraught with difficulty. Multiple lifecycle stages exist each presenting stage-specific antigens. Further, helminth parasites are notorious for their ability to dampen down and regulate host immunity. One of the first significant challenges in developing any vaccine is identifying suitable candidate protective antigens. This review explores our current knowledge in lead antigen identification and reports on recent pre-clinical and clinical trials in the context of the soil-transmitted helminths &lt;i&gt;Trichuris&lt;/i&gt;, the hookworms and &lt;i&gt;Ascaris&lt;/i&gt;. Ultimately, a multivalent anthelminthic vaccine could become an essential tool for achieving the medium-to long-term goal of controlling, or even eliminating helminth infections.">

This study aimed to investigate whether plant-derived betaine and isoquinoline alkaloids could ameliorate HS in pigs. Fifty female Large White × Landrace grower pigs, which were acclimated to control (CON), control plus betaine (BET), or control plus isoquinoline alkaloids (IQA) diets for 14 days were then exposed to heat stress or thermoneutral condition. Both BET and IQA partially ameliorated increases in respiration rate (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.013) and rectal temperature (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001) associated with HS conditions. Heat stress increased salivary cortisol concentrations and reduced plasma creatinine, lactate, and thyroid hormone concentrations. Heat stress increased colon FD4 permeability, which was reduced by IQA (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.030). Heat stress increased inflammation in the jejunum and ileum, as indicated by elevated interleukin-1β (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.022) in the jejunum and interleukin-1β (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004) and interleukin-8 (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001) in the ileum. No differences in plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were observed with HS, but betaine increased plasma TAC compared to IQA. Dietary BET increased betaine concentrations in the jejunum, ileum (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.001 for both), plasma, liver, kidney (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.010 for all), urine (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002) and tended to be higher in muscle (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.084). Betaine concentration was not influenced by HS, but it tended to be higher in plasma and accumulated in the liver. These data suggest that betaine and isoquinoline alkaloids supplementation ameliorated consequences of heat stress in grower pigs and protected against HS induced increases in colonic permeability.">

        <span class="abst" title="Intestinal worms, or soil-transmitted helminths (STHs), affect hundreds of millions of people in all tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The most prevalent STH is Ascaris lumbricoides. Through large-scale deworming programs, World Health Organization aims to reduce morbidity, caused by moderate-to-heavy intensity infections, below 2%. In order to monitor these control programs, stool samples are examined microscopically for the presence of worm eggs. This procedure requires well-trained personnel and is known to show variability between different operators interpreting the slides. We have investigated whether ABA-1, one of the excretory-secretory products of A. lumbricoides can be used as a coproantigen marker for infection with this parasite. Polyclonal antibodies were generated and a coproantigen ELISA was developed. Using this ELISA, it was found that ABA-1 in stool detected Ascaris infection with a sensitivity of 91.5% and a specificity of 95.3%. Our results also demonstrate that there is a correlation between ABA-1 levels in stool and A. lumbricoides DNA detected in stool. Using a threshold of 18.2 ng/g stool the ABA-1 ELISA correctly assigned 68.4% of infected individuals to the moderate-to-heavy intensity infection group, with a specificity of 97.1%. Furthermore, the levels of ABA-1 in stool were shown to rapidly and strongly decrease upon administration of a standard anthelminthic treatment (single oral dose of 400 mg albendazole). In an Ascaris suum infection model in pigs, it was found that ABA-1 remained undetectable until day 28 and was detected at day 42 or 56, concurrent with the appearance of worm eggs in the stool. This report demonstrates that ABA-1 can be considered an Ascaris -specific coproantigen marker that can be used to monitor infection intensity. It also opens the path for development of point-of-care immunoassay-based tests to determine A. lumbricoides infection in stool at the sample collection site.">

Most of the molecules reported to date for the control of &lt;i&gt;Saprolegnia&lt;/i&gt; infections either are inefficient or have negative impacts on the health of the fish hosts or the environment resulting in substantial economic losses. Until now, the whole proteome of &lt;i&gt;S. parasitica&lt;/i&gt; has not been explored for a systematic screening of novel inhibitors against the pathogen. The present study was designed to develop a consensus computational framework for the identification of potential target proteins and their inhibitors and subsequent experimental validation of selected compounds. Comparative analysis between the proteomes of &lt;i&gt;Saprolegnia&lt;/i&gt;, humans and fish species identified proteins that are specific and essential for the survival of the pathogen. The DrugBank database was exploited to select food and drug administration (FDA)-approved inhibitors whose high binding affinity to their respective protein targets was confirmed by computational modeling. At least six of the identified compounds significantly inhibited the growth of &lt;i&gt;S. parasitica in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Triclosan was found to be most effective with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC&lt;sub&gt;100&lt;/sub&gt;) of 4 μg/ml. Optical microscopy showed that the inhibitors affect the morphology of hyphal cells, with hyper-branching being commonly observed. The inhibitory effects of the compounds identified in this study on &lt;i&gt;Saprolegnia&lt;/i&gt;'s mycelial growth indicate that they are potentially usable for disease control against this class of oomycete pathogens. Similar approaches can be easily adopted for the identification of potential inhibitors against other plant and animal pathogenic oomycete infections.">

Most anthelminthic drug candidates are derived from plants, whereas insect-derived compounds have received little attention. This includes venom from assassin bugs, which contains numerous bioactive compounds. Here, we investigated whether venom from the European predatory assassin bug &lt;i&gt;Rhynocoris iracundus&lt;/i&gt; has antischistosomal activity. Venom concentrations of 10-50 µg/mL inhibited the motility and pairing of &lt;i&gt;S. mansoni&lt;/i&gt; adult worms in vitro and their capacity to produce eggs. We used EdU-proliferation assays to measure the effect of venom against parasite stem cells, which are essential for survival and reproduction. We found that venom depleted proliferating stem cells in different tissues of the male parasite, including neoblasts in the parenchyma and gonadal stem cells. Certain insect venoms are known to lyse eukaryotic cells, thus limiting their therapeutic potential. We therefore carried out hemolytic activity assays using porcine red blood cells, revealing that the venom had no significant effect at a concentration of 43 µg/mL. The observed anthelminthic activity and absence of hemolytic side effects suggest that the components of &lt;i&gt;R. iracundus&lt;/i&gt; venom should be investigated in more detail as potential antischistosomal leads.">

Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine the structural changes on the helminths after treatment with the plant extract.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Twenty-two compounds were identified from the plant extract out of which fatty acids were the predominant compounds. Palmitic acid was the most abundant. Bioactive phytosterols such as campesterol and stigmasterol were also detected. The plant extract was significantly effective on both the helminths and showed dose-dependent anthelmintic activity as that of albendazole. The tapeworm treated with the plant extract showed deformities on the suckers, clumping of the spines, tegumental folds and erosion of microtriches. Extensive damage was also seen on the roundworm including cuticular shrinkage, collapse of the lips, and formation of warty surface throughout the body.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;I. cylindrica extract effectively killed and caused detrimental effects on parasitic tapeworm and roundworm.

A quantitative estimation of the methanolic extracts of these plants was performed by GC-MS analysis to obtain insight into its phytoconstituents responsible for therapeutic action. The antioxidant potential of the methanol extracts of &lt;i&gt;Smilax china&lt;/i&gt; (MESC) and &lt;i&gt;Salix alba&lt;/i&gt; (MESA) were assessed with DPPH by using a UV spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 517 nm. The prevailing compounds found in MESC were lactam sugars including 2,5-dimethyl-2,4-dihydroxy-3(2H)-furanon (1.40%), 1,5-anhydro-6-deoxyhexo-2,3-diulose (4.33%), and alpha-methyl-1-sorboside (1.80%); the two alkaloids found were 1,4-methane-4,4a,5,6,7,8,9,9a-octahydro-10,10-dimethyl cyclohepta[d] pyridazine (0.87%) and 1,3,7-trimethyl-2,6-dioxopurine(0.54%); terpenes included deltacadinene (0.39%), terpineol, (+)-cedrol (22.13%), 3-thujanol (0.77%), and 9,10-dehydro-cycloisolongifolene (0.34%); fatty acids included cis-vaccenic acid (4.98%) and telfairic acid (1.10%); esters included 1,2,3-propanetriol diacetate (7.56%), 7-hexadecenoic acid, methyl ester (1.77%), eicosanoic acid, and methyl ester (0.95%); and glycerol included 1,2,3-propanetriol (28.75%). The interesting compounds found in MESA were reducing sugars like D-allose (4.40%) and pyrogallol (10.48%), alkaloids like caffeine (63.49%), and esters like methyl octadecanoate (0.53%). Both fractions revealed considerable antioxidant activity. The reported existing phenolic compounds and terpenes are responsible for the antioxidant activity of the plant extracts.">

The antifungal screening was done by agar well diffusion method. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by broth microdilution. Minimal fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) were determined by subculturing fungal strains with no visible growth onto a Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) plate.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;i&gt;Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans&lt;/i&gt; were highly sensitive while &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus flavus&lt;/i&gt; did not show sensitivity up to 1 mg/ml of essential oil; MICs ranged from 0.083 mg/ml to 0.208 mg/ml. Concentration and fungal species showed significant dose-dependent associations (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.0001) with antifungal activity.

        <span class="abst" title="Sheep farming is the backbone of a rural economy in developing countries, and haemonchosis is a major impediment in the way of its progress. Haemonchus contortus (H. contortus) infection persists all over the world particularly in the tropical and sub-tropical regions. Various review articles have been published to substantially cover one or more aspects of its morphology, prevalence, pathogenesis, symptoms, diagnosis, immune response, drug resistance, treatment, and control measure. The objective of this paper is to briefly review past and present information available in the aforementioned areas in one place to enable the readers to fully understand the problem from a broader perspective. H. contortus parasite harbours in abomasum of affected animal and feeds on its blood, producing mild to severe symptoms and even death in acute form. The parasite thus inflicts heavy production losses and is of economic importance. H. contortus has developed diverse characters over the years leading to limited success in the production of vaccines. Indiscriminate use of the anthelmintics has produced drug resistance against almost all conventional products. Efficacy of medicinal plants and non-conventional chemicals has been reported under controlled experiments; however, research on their adverse effects on growth and fertility is yet to be studied. Research on molecular tools for identification and introduction of resistant genes into the flock is also underway but still a long journey to find its field application. Crossbreeding may compromise the production traits of the existing flock. In given circumstances, a targeted selective treatment approach along with selective breeding, culling of more susceptible animals, and maintaining a good body condition score through the provision of a balanced diet remains a workable strategy to control haemonchosis in sheep.">

        <span class="abst" title="Control of fungal pathogens is increasingly problematic due to the limited number of effective drugs available for antifungal therapy. Conventional antifungal drugs could also trigger human cytotoxicity associated with the kidneys and liver, including the generation of reactive oxygen species. Moreover, increased incidences of fungal resistance to the classes of azoles, such as fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, or posaconazole, or echinocandins, including caspofungin, anidulafungin, or micafungin, have been documented. Of note, certain azole fungicides such as propiconazole or tebuconazole that are applied to agricultural fields have the same mechanism of antifungal action as clinical azole drugs. Such long-term application of azole fungicides to crop fields provides environmental selection pressure for the emergence of pan-azole-resistant fungal strains such as &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus fumigatus&lt;/i&gt; having TR34/L98H mutations, specifically, a 34 bp insertion into the cytochrome P450 51A (&lt;i&gt;CYP51A&lt;/i&gt;) gene promoter region and a leucine-to-histidine substitution at codon 98 of &lt;i&gt;CYP51A&lt;/i&gt;. Altogether, the emerging resistance of pathogens to currently available antifungal drugs and insufficiency in the discovery of new therapeutics engender the urgent need for the development of new antifungals and/or alternative therapies for effective control of fungal pathogens. We discuss the current needs for the discovery of new clinical antifungal drugs and the recent drug repurposing endeavors as alternative methods for fungal pathogen control.">

Phytochemical screening, HPLC analysis, and acute toxicity study of MEPGL were carried out. Various concentrations of MEPGL (100, 200, 400, and 600 mg/kg) were administered orally to diabetic rats for 45 days on a daily basis. The antidiabetic effect of MEPGL was examined by measuring blood glucose, plasma insulin, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, as well as with an oral glucose tolerance test. The antioxidant effect of MEPGL was determined by analyzing hepatic and renal antioxidant markers, namely superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), reduced glutathione (GSH), and lipid peroxidation. The other biochemical markers alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), urea, and creatinine, as well as total cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) were also studied. Type 2 diabetes significantly altered these parameters, while oral administration of the MEPGL significantly ameliorated them. Moreover, the pancreatic histopathological changes were attenuated with MEPGL treatment. In a nutshell, oral MEPGL administration in diabetic rats showed antidiabetic activity due to its antioxidant activity, most probably due to the gallic acid, ellagic acid, and apigenin found in MEPGL.">

Despite the relevance of this condition in the country there is still an important gap regarding scientific evidences and knowledge systematization in the indexed literature, that could be used to inform and optimize national public health policies willing to address it. Furthermore, the changes in anemia epidemiology among African preschool children and the late updates in nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive preventive strategies in the continent are of imperative relevance, as they could contribute to design context-specific national approaches to reduce anemia's morbidity and mortality. In this study we intent to perform a systematic review regarding the sparse evidence available on the country regarding the prevalence of anemia, its associated factors, the prevention, and/or control strategies with potential to reduce anemia that were implemented, and to discuss interventions targeting infections and/or nutrition conducted in other African countries.">

        <span class="abst" title="Helminths stage a powerful infection that allows the parasite to damage host tissue through migration and feeding while simultaneously evading the host immune system. This feat is accomplished in part through the release of a diverse set of molecules that contribute to pathogenicity and immune suppression. Many of these molecules have been characterized in terms of their ability to influence the infectious capabilities of helminths across the tree of life. These include nematodes that infect insects, known as entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) and plants with applications in agriculture and medicine. In this review we will first discuss the nematode virulence factors, which aid parasite colonization or tissue invasion, and cause many of the negative symptoms associated with infection. These include enzymes involved in detoxification, factors essential for parasite development and growth, and highly immunogenic ES proteins. We also explore how these parasites use several classes of molecules (proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids) to evade the host's immune defenses. For example, helminths release immunomodulatory molecules in extracellular vesicles that may be protective in allergy and inflammatory disease. Collectively, these nematode-derived molecules allow parasites to persist for months or even years in a host, avoiding being killed or expelled by the immune system. Here, we evaluate these molecules, for their individual and combined potential as vaccine candidates, targets for anthelminthic drugs, and therapeutics for allergy and inflammatory disease. Last, we evaluate shared virulence and immunomodulatory mechanisms between mammalian and non-mammalian plant parasitic nematodes and EPNs, and discuss the utility of EPNs as a cost-effective model for studying nematode-derived molecules. Better knowledge of the virulence and immunomodulatory molecules from both entomopathogenic nematodes and soil-based helminths will allow for their use as beneficial agents in fighting disease and pests, divorced from their pathogenic consequences.">

Therefore, this study aimed at determining the magnitude and associated factors of hematological abnormalities among undernourished under-five children attending at the University of Gondar Specialized Referral Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia.&lt;h4&gt;Methods and materials&lt;/h4&gt;An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted on a total of 251 undernourished under-five children at University of Gondar Specialized Referral Hospital from January to May 2020. A convenient sampling technique was employed to select study participants. Data were collected using a pretested structured questionnaire. Blood samples were collected for complete blood count which were determined by Sysmex KX-21N analyzer. Stool sample was processed via direct wet mount. Thin and thick blood films were examined to assess malaria parasite. The data were entered to EpiData version 4.6.0.0 and analyzed using SPSS version 23 software. Bi-variable and multi-variable binary logistic regression model were fitted to identify factors associated with hematological abnormalities. A p-value &lt;0.05 in the multivariable analysis was considered as statistically significant.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The overall magnitude of anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia was 53.4%, 26.7%, 23.9%, 8%, and 2.8%, respectively. Being male, age 6-23 months, high birth order, intestinal parasite infection, edema, not eating vegetables and fruits, and paternal occupation were found to be associated with anemia. Only the age of a child was associated with leukocytosis in undernourished children.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The current study demonstrated the predominant existence of anemia, leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis among undernourished under-five children. Therefore, early diagnosis, monitoring and setting intervention strategies for anemia especially among children under two years old are required to prevent further complication.">

        <span class="abst" title="Parasitic nematode infections cause debilitating diseases and impede economic productivity. Antinematode chemotherapies are fundamental to modern medicine and are also important for industries including agriculture, aquaculture and animal health. However, the lack of suitable treatments for some diseases and the rise of nematode resistance to many available therapies necessitates the discovery and development of new drugs. Here, marine epiphytic bacteria represent a promising repository of newly discovered antinematode compounds. Epiphytic bacteria are ubiquitous on marine surfaces where they are under constant pressure of grazing by bacterivorous predators (e.g., protozoans and nematodes). Studies have shown that these bacteria have developed defense strategies to prevent grazers by producing toxic bioactive compounds. Although several active metabolites against nematodes have been identified from marine bacteria, drug discovery from marine microorganisms remains underexplored. In this review, we aim to provide further insight into the need and potential for marine epiphytic bacteria to become a new source of antinematode drugs. We discuss current and emerging strategies, including culture-independent high throughput screening and the utilization of &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; as a model target organism, which will be required to advance antinematode drug discovery and development from marine microbial sources.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Anisakis simplex&lt;/i&gt; (s.l.) is a complex of three sibling (biological) species of parasitic nematodes of marine mammals, including &lt;i&gt;A. berlandi&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;A. pegreffii&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A. simplex&lt;/i&gt; (s.s.). It is characterized by a complex life cycle in which humans can become accidental hosts by consuming dishes made of raw or undercooked fish containing L3 larvae, which in many regions of the world is related to the national or regional culinary tradition. This has spurred scientific efforts to develop new methods for treating the disease, called anisakiasis, and to neutralize invasive L3. Thiabendazole (TBZ) is a wide-spectrum anthelminthic with a higher efficacy than albendazole, a drug whose long-term use induces resistance in many parasitic species. Cytochromes P450 participate in TBZ metabolism, and the expression of their genes is controlled by nuclear hormone receptors (NHR). This study aimed to examine the effects of TBZ on the above-described pathway in invasive larvae of &lt;i&gt;A. simplex&lt;/i&gt; (s.l.). The efficacy of TBZ against &lt;i&gt;A. simplex&lt;/i&gt; (s.l.) larvae was observed for the first time. Larvae were cultured in vitro for 72 h in a medium containing TBZ at five concentrations from 0.5 to 1.5 mM. However, the survival curves did not significantly differ from each other. This means that all of the concentrations of TBZ had a similar effect on the &lt;i&gt;A. simplex&lt;/i&gt; (s.l.) L3 larvae during in vitro culture. Nevertheless, TBZ modified the expression of &lt;i&gt;nhr-48&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;cyp13a3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;cyp1a1&lt;/i&gt; genes in the L3 of &lt;i&gt;A. simplex&lt;/i&gt; (s.l.).">

The anthelmintic efficacy of an aqueous &lt;i&gt;Punica granatum&lt;/i&gt; macerate was evaluated in sheep naturally infected by GIN in southern Italy. The macerate was chemically characterized by chromatographic analysis coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC/HRMS) and an aliquot was concentrated to obtain a dry extract. A part was characterized, the remaining washed with methanol to obtain an insoluble residue and methanol phase. In the methanol fraction, the quantitatively predominant gallic acid was purified to obtain the pure molecule. The three fractions thus obtained were used for in vitro studies (i.e., egg hatch test) to verify anthelmintic efficacy. For this purpose, fecal samples were collected from sheep naturally infected by GINs. Fractions were diluted in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/DMSO 0.5% at 1.00, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.05, and 0.005 mg/mL concentrations. Thiabendazole (0.25 and 0.5 mg/mL) and deionized water were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Egg hatch test results indicated that all fractions caused a significant (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) egg hatch inhibition within 48 h of exposure highlighting a high (&gt;82%) efficacy in vitro at all tested doses. Maximal egg hatching inhibition effect was exhibited by the methanol fraction (99.3% and 89.3% at 1 and 0.005 mg/mL concentrations), followed by the insoluble residue and gallic acid (94.7% and 85.3% and 94.0% and 82.7% at 1 and 0.005 mg/mL, respectively). The current study validated the anthelmintic potential of traditional &lt;i&gt;P. granatum&lt;/i&gt; macerate against GIN infection in sheep, thus highlighting the role of gallic acid as principal component and justifying a need to undertake further in vivo studies on these ethno-veterinary remedies.">

The aim of this paper is to provide an extensive descriptive overview of the medical uses given to these herbs, highlighting both the authors in medical culture responsible for their dissemination, as well as their major galenic formulations. Databases on medical science, reference textbooks on medical history, botanics (aromatic herbs), and pharmacognosy were consulted. The use of mints remotes to Classical Antiquity, with major contributions from Pliny the Elder. In the Middle Ages, the increased knowledge surrounding mints came from Byzantine physicians, while, in the Modern Age, technological developments allowed the production of mint-based products which have become part of elaborate galenic formulas employed by an increasing number of physicians, as well as have also stimulated both scientific and artistic interests alike. In present-day medicine, several mints and mint-based products are being researched as potential therapeutic alternatives for many diseases, while also being vastly employed in food and cosmetic industries.">

In this review, we analyze the bioactivity of more than 450 compounds from ca. 400 species of heterobranch molluscs that are useful for the snails to protect themselves in different ways and/or that may be useful to us because of their pharmacological activities. Their ecological activities include predator avoidance, toxicity, antimicrobials, antifouling, trail-following and alarm pheromones, sunscreens and UV protection, tissue regeneration, and others. The most studied ecological activity is predation avoidance, followed by toxicity. Their pharmacological activities consist of cytotoxicity and antitumoral activity; antibiotic, antiparasitic, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory activity; and activity against neurodegenerative diseases and others. The most studied pharmacological activities are cytotoxicity and anticancer activities, followed by antibiotic activity. Overall, it can be observed that heterobranch molluscs are extremely interesting in regard to the study of marine natural products in terms of both chemical ecology and biotechnology studies, providing many leads for further detailed research in these fields in the near future.">

Therefore, efforts have been made to understand how wildlife can rebound from anthropogenic disturbances. An essential mechanism to adapt to environmental and social changes is the fluctuations in the host gut microbiome. Here we give a comprehensive description of anthropogenically induced microbiome alterations in Asian elephants (n = 30). We detected gut microbial changes due to overseas translocation, captivity and deworming. We found that microbes belonging to Planococcaceae had the highest contribution in the microbiome alterations after translocation, while Clostridiaceae, Spirochaetaceae and Bacteroidia were the most affected after captivity. However, deworming significantly changed the abundance of Flavobacteriaceae, Sphingobacteriaceae, Xanthomonadaceae, Weeksellaceae and Burkholderiaceae. These findings may provide fundamental ideas to help guide the preservation tactics and probiotic replacement therapies of a dysbiosed gut microbiome in Asian elephants. More generally, these results show the severity of anthropogenic activities at the level of gut microbiome, altering the adaptation processes to new environments and the subsequent capability to maintain normal physiological processes in animals.">

        <span class="abst" title="This study compared the current nutritional status, hemoglobin levels and their associations with soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections between two categories of Negritos (indigenous): (i) Inland Jungle Villages (IJV) (ii) and Resettlement Plan Scheme (RPS) near town peripheries, decades after redevelopment and demarginalization. A total of 416 Negritos (IJV: 149; RPS: 267) was included for nutritional profiling based on anthropometric analysis. However, only 196 (IJV: 64; RPS: 132) individuals consented to blood taking for the hemoglobin (Hb) measurements. Subsequently, the association of undernutrition and anemia with STH infections were determined based on univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. The overall prevalence of stunting, wasting, and underweight amongst children and adolescents (n = 343) were 45.8%, 42.3% and 59.1%, respectively. In adults (n = 73), the prevalence of underweight was low (6.8%) but overweight and obese was prominent (26.0%). For anemia (n = 196), an overall prevalence rate of 68.4% were observed with 80% and 70.4% of children aged 2-6 y/o and aged 7-12 y/o, respectively being anemic. Comparatively, the prevalence of underweight (WAZ) was significantly higher in the RPS versus the IJV (P = 0.03) In the IJV, children aged ≤ 6 y/o and having STH poly-parasitism were associated with underweight (P = 0.01) and moderate-severe T. trichiura infection was associated with anemia. Whilst in the RPS, underweight was highly associated with only T. trichiura infection (P = 0.04). Wasting was significantly associated with young children aged ≤10 in both IJV (P = 0.004) and RPS (P = 0.02). Despite efforts in improving provision of facilities and amenities among the indigenous, this study highlighted a high magnitude of nutritional issues among the Negritos especially those in the RPS and their likely association with STH infections and decades of demarginalization. Joint nutritional intervention strategies with mass anti-helminthic treatment are imperative and urgently needed to reduce the undernutrition problems especially among indigenous children.">

        <span class="abst" title="Diabetes mellitus is a major metabolic disorder worldwide. Several herbs are being tested for the management of diabetes. &lt;i&gt;Cassia auriculata&lt;/i&gt; is one of those herbs known for its nutritional value and health benefits. However, limited scientific evidence has been shown on the elucidation of its root bioactives as well as biological activity. This study attempted to identify and characterize phenolic compounds from the potent root extract and to evaluate its antioxidant as well as antidiabetic properties in both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; models. The results revealed that the total polyphenol and flavonoid contents were highest in the methanolic extract. The methanolic extract of the &lt;i&gt;C. auriculata&lt;/i&gt; root showed the highest antioxidant and antidiabetic activities &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; than other extracts. These biological activities may be because the extract is rich in coumaric acid and -OH groups as revealed by high-performance liquid chromatography and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analyses, respectively. Further, the antidiabetic activity of the methanolic extract was studied in a diet-induced type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) C57BL/6 mouse model. A significant increase in fasting blood glucose and decreased plasma insulin levels in T2DM mice confirmed the development of the diabetic condition. In addition, the T2DM mice showed oxidative stress in the plasma as well as muscle tissue and significant alterations in the plasma biochemistry, &lt;i&gt;viz&lt;/i&gt;., lipid profile, liver, and renal function tests. However, the administration of the ethanolic extract of the &lt;i&gt;C. auriculata&lt;/i&gt; root (150 mg/kg body weight) to T2DM mice normalized the condition comparable to that of control mice. Thus, the extract can be used as a potent antioxidant and antidiabetic agent in pharmaceutical companies.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;b&gt;Background:&lt;/b&gt; Antimicrobial resistance represents a serious threat to human health across the globe. The cost of bringing a new antibiotic from discovery to market is high and return on investment is low. Furthermore, the development of new antibiotics has slowed dramatically since the 1950s' golden age of discovery. Plants produce a variety of bioactive secondary metabolites that could be used to fuel the future discovery pipeline. While many studies have focused on specific aspects of plants and plant natural products with antibacterial properties, a comprehensive review of the antibacterial potential of plants has never before been attempted. &lt;b&gt;Objectives:&lt;/b&gt; This systematic review aims to evaluate reports on plants with significant antibacterial activities. &lt;b&gt;Methods:&lt;/b&gt; Following the PRISMA model, we searched three electronic databases: Web of Science, PubMed and SciFinder by using specific keywords: &quot;plant,&quot; &quot;antibacterial,&quot; &quot;inhibitory concentration.&quot; &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; We identified a total of 6,083 articles published between 1946 and 2019 and then reviewed 66% of these (4,024) focusing on articles published between 2012 and 2019. A rigorous selection process was implemented using clear inclusion and exclusion criteria, yielding data on 958 plant species derived from 483 scientific articles. Antibacterial activity is found in 51 of 79 vascular plant orders throughout the phylogenetic tree. Most are reported within eudicots, with the bulk of species being asterids. Antibacterial activity is not prominent in monocotyledons. Phylogenetic distribution strongly supports the concept of chemical evolution across plant clades, especially in more derived eudicot families. The Lamiaceae, Fabaceae and Asteraceae were the most represented plant families, while &lt;i&gt;Cinnamomum verum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Rosmarinus vulgaris&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Thymus vulgaris&lt;/i&gt; were the most studied species. South Africa was the most represented site of plant collection. Crude extraction in methanol was the most represented type of extraction and leaves were the main plant tissue investigated. Finally, &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; was the most targeted pathogenic bacteria in these studies. We closely examine 70 prominent medicinal plant species from the 15 families most studied in the literature. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; This review depicts the current state of knowledge regarding antibacterials from plants and provides powerful recommendations for future research directions.">

In this review, the most recent evidence on health effects of edible &lt;i&gt;Artemisia&lt;/i&gt; species and some of its constituents are presented and discussed, based on studies published until 2020, available in the Scopus, Web of Sciences and PubMed databases, related to food applications, nutritional and sesquiterpene lactones composition, and their therapeutic effects supported by in vivo and clinical studies. The analysis of more than 300 selected articles highlights the beneficial effect on health and the high clinical relevance of several &lt;i&gt;Artemisia&lt;/i&gt; species besides some sesquiterpene lactones constituents and their derivatives. From an integrated perspective, as it includes therapeutic and nutritional properties, without ignoring some adverse effects described in the literature, this review shows the great potential of &lt;i&gt;Artemisia&lt;/i&gt; plants and some of their constituents as dietary supplements, functional foods and as the source of new, more efficient, and safe medicines. Despite all the benefits demonstrated, some gaps need to be filled, mainly related to the use of raw &lt;i&gt;Artemisia&lt;/i&gt; extracts, such as its standardization and clinical trials on adverse effects and its health care efficacy.">

The coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has already brought massive human suffering and major economic disruption and unfortunately, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 so far. Herbal medicines and purified natural products can provide a rich resource for novel antiviral drugs. Therefore, in this review, we focused on the sterols and triterpenes as potential candidates derived from natural sources with well-reported in vitro efficacy against numerous types of viruses. Moreover, we compiled from these reviewed compounds a library of 162 sterols and triterpenes that was subjected to a computer-aided virtual screening against the active sites of the recently reported SARS-CoV-2 protein targets. Interestingly, the results suggested some compounds as potential drug candidates for the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.">
