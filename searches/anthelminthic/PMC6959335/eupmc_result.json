    "Phloroglucinol (1,3,5 tri-hydroxy-benzene) (PGL), a natural phenolic substance, is a peroxidase inhibitor and has anti-oxidant, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, radio-protective, spasmolytic and anti-cancer activities. PGL, as a medicine, is administered to patients to control the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and acute renal colic, in clinical trials. PGL, as a phenolic substance, can cause cytotoxic effects. Administration of PGL up to 300 mg/kg (bw) is well tolerated by animals, while in cell lines its toxicity is developed at concentrations above the dose of 10 μg/ml. Furthermore, it seems that tumor or immortalized cells are more susceptible to the toxic power of PGL, than normal cells. However, studies of its cytotoxic potency, at the cellular level, in complex, differentiated and meta-mitotic biological systems, are still missing. In the present work, we have investigated the toxic activity of PGL in somatic epithelial cells, constituting the follicular compartment of a developing egg-chamber (or, follicle), which directs the choriogenesis (i.e. chorion assembly) process, during late oogenesis of Drosophila melanogaster. Our results reveal that treatment of in vitro growing Drosophila follicles with PGL, at a concentration of 0.2 mM (or, 25.2 μg/ml), does not lead to follicle-cell toxicity, since the protein-synthesis program and developmental pattern of choriogenesis are normally completed. Likewise, the 1 mM dose of PGL was also characterized by lack of toxicity, since the chorionic proteins were physiologically synthesized and the chorion structure appeared unaffected, except for a short developmental delay, being observed. In contrast, concentrations of 10, 20 or 40 mM of PGL unveiled a dose-dependent, increasing, toxic effect, being initiated by interruption of protein synthesis and disassembly of cell-secretory machinery, and, next, followed by fragmentation of the granular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into vesicles, and formation of autophagic vacuoles. Follicle cells enter into an apoptotic process, with autophagosomes and large vacuoles being formed in the cytoplasm, and nucleus showing protrusions, granular nucleolus and condensed chromatin. PGL, also, proved able to induce disruption of nuclear envelope, activation of nucleus autophagy (nucleophagy) and formation of a syncytium-like pattern being produced by fusion of plasma membranes of two or more individual follicle cells. Altogether, follicle cell-dependent choriogenesis in Drosophila has been herein presented as an excellent, powerful and reliable multi-cellular, differentiated, model biological (animal) system for drug-cytotoxicity assessment, with the versatile compound PGL serving as a characteristic paradigm. In conclusion, PGL is a substance that may act beneficially for a variety of pathological conditions and can be safely used for differentiated somatic -epithelial- cells at clinically low concentrations. At relatively high doses, it could potentially induce apoptotic and autophagic cell death, thus being likely exploited as a therapeutic agent against a number of pathologies, including human malignancies."
