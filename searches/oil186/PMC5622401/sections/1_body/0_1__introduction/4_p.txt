0: Although  C. gileadensis has been an important medicinal plant throughout history, information about the essential oil composition of wild  C. gileadensis is lacking.
1: Therefore, in this work, the essential oil compositions attained from the stem bark, leaves, and fruits of wild  C. gileadensis collected in Ein Gedi, Israel were determined and compared to the composition of commercially used  C. gileadensis oil.
2: In addition, to further characterize the essential oils, the enantiomeric distributions of the monoterpenoids in  C. gileadensis essential oils were determined.
