0: The essential oil compositions of wild and commercial  C. gileadensis were analyzed by GC-MS using a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 Ultra (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD, USA) operated in the electron impact (EI) mode (electron energy = 70 eV) with a scan range of 40400 amu and a scan rate of 3.0 scans/s, and GC-MS solution software.
1: The GC column was a ZB-5 fused silica capillary column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA), 30 m length  0.25 mm inner diameter, with a (5% phenyl)-polymethylsiloxane stationary phase and a film thickness of 0.25 m. The carrier gas was helium, with a column head pressure of 552 kPa and flow rate of 1.37 mL/min.
2: Injector temperature was 250 C and the ion source temperature was 200 C. The GC oven temperature program was set for an initial temperature of 50 C and increased at a rate of 2 C/min to 260 C. A 5%  w/ v solution of the sample in CH 2Cl 2 was prepared, and 0.1 L was injected with a splitting mode of 30:1.
3: Identification of the oil components was based on retention indices determined by reference to a homologous series of  n-alkanes, and by comparison of their mass spectral fragmentation patterns with those reported in the literature [ 19] and stored in our in-house MS library.
4: Percentages were determined based on total ion current integrations of the peak areas, and are uncorrected.
