0: Chiral analysis of the essential oils of wild and commercial  C. gileadensis was performed on a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010S (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD, USA) operated in the EI mode (electron energy = 70 eV) with a scan range of 40400 amu and a scan rate of 3.0 scans/s The GC was equipped with a Restek B-Dex 325 capillary column (Restek Corp., Bellefonte, PA, USA) (30 m  0.25 mm ID  0.25 m film).
1: The oven temperature began at 50 C, and was then gradually raised to 120 C at a rate of 1.5 C/min.
2: After reaching 120 C, the oven temperature was increased to 200 C at 2 C/min intervals and kept at this temperature for 5 min.
3: Helium was the carrier gas, and the flow rate was maintained at 1.8 mL/min.
4: Samples were diluted to 3%  w/ v with CH 2Cl 2, and a 0.1 L sample was injected in a split mode at a split ratio of 1:45.
5: The monoterpenoid enantiomers were identified by comparison of retention times with authentic samples obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI, USA).
6: Relative enantiomer percentages were determined based on peak areas.
