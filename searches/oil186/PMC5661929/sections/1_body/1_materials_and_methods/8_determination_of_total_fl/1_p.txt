0: The total flavonoids content (TFC) was performed according to the colorimetric assay previously published [ 15].
1: One mL of the sample (1 mg/mL) was mixed with 0.75 mL of 5% sodium nitrite solution.
2: After 5 min, 0.15 ml of 10% aluminium chloride solution (AlCl 3) was added and the mixture was left standing for 5 min, and then 0.5 ml of 1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was added to the solution.
3: The volume of the mixture was adjusted to 2.5 mL with distilled water and mixed well.
4: The absorbance was measured at 510 nm.
5: TFC was expressed as milligrams of catechin equivalent per gram dry weight basis (mg CAE/g DW).
