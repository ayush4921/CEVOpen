0: Moisture, protein, fat, and ash were determined using the AOAC process (1990) [ 12].
1: The ash content was determined after heat treatment at 600  15 C. Total carbohydrates have been calculated by removing from 100% the amount of moisture, total fat, protein and ash.
2: Energy has been calculated using this equation: Energy (kcal) = 4  (g protein + g carbohydrate) + 9  (g fat).
3: Mineral elements analyses were performed using the method of Rjeibi et al.
4: [ 13].
