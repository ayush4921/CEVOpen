0: This test was done according to the method reported by Sahreen et al.
1: [ 17].
2: Different sample concentration (1 mL) were mixed with 2.4 mL of phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4) and 0.6 mL of H 2O 2 solution (40 mM).
3: The mixture was shaken vigorously and incubated at room temperature for 10 min vitamin C was used as positive control.
4: The absorbance was measured at 230 nm.
5: H 2O 2 scavenging activity (%) = 1 Absorbance  sample / Absorbance  control  100.
