0: The reductive potential of studied samples was determined according to the method reported by Bounatirou, [ 16].
1: Different sample concentration (1 mL) were mixed with 1 mL of phosphate buffer (0.2 mol/L, pH 6.6) and 1 mL of potassium ferricyanide K 3Fe(CN) 6 (10 mg/mL).
2: After incubation at 50 C for 20 min, 1 mL of trichloroacetic acid (10 mg/mL) was added to the mixture and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min.
3: Finally, FeCl 3 (10 mg/mL) was added to the upper layer and left to stand for 10 min before the measurement of the absorbance at 700 nm on UVVIS spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-190).
4: The amount of sample providing 0.5 absorbances was determined from the graphical of absorbance at 700 nm.
5: BHT was used as the control.
