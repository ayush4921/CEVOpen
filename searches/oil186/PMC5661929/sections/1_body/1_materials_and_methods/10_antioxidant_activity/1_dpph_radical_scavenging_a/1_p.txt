0: The effect of  P. tobira seed extract and essential oil on DPPH radical was determined following the method reported by Bounatirou, [ 16].
1: Adequate solutions of each extract were created to obtain a final volume of 1 mL and were mixed with 2 mL of a freshly prepared DPPH solution (0.1 mM).
2: The After 30 min of incubation in the dark.
3: The absorbance was measured at 517 nm on UVVIS spectrophotometer.
4: Vitamin C and BHT were used as a control.
5: Different concentrations (0.0110 mg/mL) of the sample were used in order to determine IC 50 (amount of sample providing 50% of scavenging on DPPH).
6: IC50 value was determined from the linear regression equation obtained from the concentrations of the sample and the percentage of inhibition.
