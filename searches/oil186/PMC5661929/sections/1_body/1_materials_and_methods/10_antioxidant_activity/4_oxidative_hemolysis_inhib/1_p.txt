0: Methods of assessment of hemolytic activity, focus on the study of the potential damage caused by hydrogen peroxide (H 2O 2) in erythrocyte membranes.
1: The anti-hemolytic activity of the essential oil was determined following the method reported by Lalitha and Selvam, [ 18] with modifications [ 13].
2: Whole fresh human blood from healthy person (15 mL) was collected in EDTA tubes and centrifuged for 10 min at 1000  g at 4 C. The plasma was removed and obtained red blood cells (RBCs) was suspended in 10 mM PBS (pH 7.4).
3: The erythrocytes were washed 3 times with PBS and finally re-suspended in PBS to obtain a solution at 4%.
4: One milliliter of this suspension was mixed with different concentrations (10100 g/mL) of the essential oils and methanolic extract and added to 7.5 mM of H 2O 2 prepared in PBS.
5: After incubation with agitation for 120 min at 37 C, the resulting mixture was centrifuged at 1000  g for 5 min.
6: Finally, the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 540 nm on UVVIS spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-190).
7: Vitamin C was used as the reference (530 g/mL).
