0: HS-SPME technique was used to identify aroma compounds from  P. tobira.
1: The SPME fiber 75-m carboxen/ polydimethylsiloxane (CAR/PDMS) (preconditioned for 6 min at 240 C) was used for analysis.
2: The dried powdered seeds (300 mg) were hermetically sealed in 4 ml vial.
3: The SPME fiber holder was then introduced into the vial.
4: Both sample and fiber were incubated for 30 min at 60 C as predefined extraction time and temperature, respectively.
5: After extraction, the fiber was withdrawn from the sample and thermally introduced into the injection port of the GCMS for desorption for 3 min at 240 C in splitless mode.
6: The experiment was performed in triplicate.
7: The alkane solution (C 7C 30 in n-hexane) performed by headspace extraction during 30 min, at 60 C, was used to calculate the retention indices.
