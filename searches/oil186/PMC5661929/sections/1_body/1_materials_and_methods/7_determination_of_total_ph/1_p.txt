0: The total phenolic content (TPC) was determined using a modified colorimetric Folin-Ciocalteu method previously reported by Tlili et al.
1: [ 15].
2: Briefly, Folin-Ciocalteu reagent was added to 1 mg of different sample and incubated for 5 min at room temperature.
3: Next, 7.5% of Na 2CO 3 was added to the mixture and re-incubate for 60 min at room temperature in the dark.
4: Finally, the absorbance was measured at 760 nm in a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, 1240 model, Tokyo, Japan).
5: The analysis was performed in triplicate and TPC was expressed as gallic acid equivalents in milligrams per gram of dry weight basis (mg GAE/g DW).
