0: The analyses were performed in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-DAD) with a Varian ProStar HPLC System (Varian 330/ Vis Detector and Varian 230 SDM) and C18 column (Zorbax, 4.6 mm  250 mm).
1: The mobile phase consisted of acetic acid (solvent A) and methanol (solvent B).
2: The gradient was composed of 0% (B) for 2 min; 50% (B) until 30 min and 80% (B) for 5 min.
3: The methanolic extracts were utilized in the concentration of 1 mg/mL.
4: The flow rate was 0.9 mL/min and the volume injected was 40 L. The detected compounds were identified by comparing their retention time with those of injected authentic standards from Sigma-Aldrich and the use of DAD spectra (200600 nm).
