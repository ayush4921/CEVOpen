0: The reducing power of essential oils was determined by the method developed earlier [ 36].
1: In brief, varying concentrations of tested samples (525 L/mL) were mixed with 2.5 mL of phosphate buffer (200 mM, pH = 6.6) and 2.5 mL of 1% potassium ferricyanide, K 3 [FeCN 6].
2: The mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 50 C. After incubation, 2.5 mL of trichloroacetic acid was added to the mixtures, followed by centrifugation at 650 rpm for 10 min.
3: The upper layer (1 mL) was mixed with 5 mL distilled water and 1 mL of 0.1% ferric chloride and the absorbance of the resultant solution was measured at 700 nm.
4: Reducing power % = (A 0  A t)/A 0  100, where A 0 = the absorbance value of the control sample and A t = the absorbance value of the test sample.
5: The percent of chelating ability was plotted against concentrations and using a standard (gallic acid).
6: The reducing potential of essential oils was discussed in terms of their RP 50 values.
