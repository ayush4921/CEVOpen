0: The chelation of Fe 2+ by essential oils was evaluated using the method developed earlier [ 37].
1: In brief, 0.1 mL of 2 mM FeCl 24H 2O, 0.2 mL of 5 mM ferrozine, and 4.7 mL of methanol were added to different concentrations of a test sample (525 L/mL).
2: The solutions were mixed and allowed to react for 10 min.
3: The absorbance was determined at 562 nm; IC% = (A 0  A t)/A 0  100, where A 0 = the absorbance value of the control sample and A t = the absorbance value of the test sample.
4: The percent of chelating ability was plotted against the concentration, and the standard curve was drawn using a standard antioxidant (EDTA).
5: The metal chelating ability of essential oils was discussed in terms of their IC 50 values.
