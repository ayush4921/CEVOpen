0: This is a quick method to study the scavenging ability of the antioxidants [ 35].
1: Briefly, the tested samples (525 L/mL) were added to 5 mL of a 0.004% methanol solution of DPPH.
2: Finally, the absorbance was read against a blank at 517 nm after 30 min of incubation at room temperature.
3: Ascorbic acid was used as the standard antioxidant.
4: Inhibition of free radical by DPPH in percent (IC %) was calculated using the equation.
5: IC% = (A 0  A t)/A 0  100, where A 0 = the absorbance value of the control sample, A t = the absorbance value of the test sample, and IC = inhibitory concentration.
6: The radical scavenging activities of essential oils were discussed in terms of their IC 50 values.
