0: GC and GC/MS analyses of all the oils were performed on a Thermo Fischer GC apparatus using an DB5-5MS fused-silica capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 m film thickness) equipped with a flame ionization (FID) detector.
1: GC/MS analysis of the different essential oil samples were performed using a GC MS-QP 2010, in the following conditions.
2: Column DB-5 (30 m  0.25 mm i.d.
3: ; 0.25 m film thickness; J&W Scientific, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA); carrier gas: helium, with a flow rate of 1 mL/min; injection temperature: 250 C; oven temperature programme: initial temperature 80 C, isothermal for 2 min, RAMP 7 C/min, final temperature 280 C, and isothermal for 10 C/min.
4: Ionization mode: EI (70 eV), mass range: 406500 amu.
5: The compounds were identified with the help of NIST-MS, FFNSC Wiley Library, and comparing the data with literature reports and GC retention indices [ 34].
