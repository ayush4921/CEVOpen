0: The preliminary formulation of the oleogel was prepared for the suitable lower 5% and upper 8.5% limits of colloidal silica concentration for the gelation of oils.
1: The experimental design is conducted by using Design-Expert 6 (version 6.0.8, Stat-Easy Inc., Minneapolis, USA).
2: A set of mixtures was formed using response surface design central composite criterion.
3: The experimental mixture design was applied to study the effect of two-component systemcolloidal silicaon the response variables: firmness, cohesiveness, consistency, and index of viscosity.
4: The set of mixtures is shown in  Table 1.
