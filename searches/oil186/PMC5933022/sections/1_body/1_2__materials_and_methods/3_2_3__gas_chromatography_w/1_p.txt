0: GC-FID analyses were carried out on gas chromatograph GC-2010 Plus (Shimadzu Corporation, USA).
1: Compounds were separated on CrossbondTM 5% diphenyl/95% dimethyl polysiloxane Rxi-5 ms, 30 m  0,25 mmi.d., df 0,25  m (Restek, USA) capillary column.
2: The injection volume was 1  l, with a split ratio of 1 : 100.
3: Ultra-high-purity helium was used as a carrier gas at a constant column flow rate of 1,29 ml/min.
4: The injector and detector temperatures were set at 290 and 310C, respectively.
5: Samples were diluted individually with methanol before GC analysis.
6: The identification of main compounds (thymol and carvacrol) was performed by comparing their retention times of the chromatographic peaks to the reference standards.
7: The main compounds (thymol and carvacrol) were quantified using GC-FID chromatographic data and equations of linear regressions ( R2  0.9999) of calibration graphs (area versus concentration of standard).
8: The initial temperature of column was set as 70C, at which it was held for 2 min.
9: The temperature of the column was programmed from 70C to 250 at a rate of 20C/min.
