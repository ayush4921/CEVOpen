0: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the oleogels with essential thyme oil was determined using  Candida albicans ATCC 60193 culture.
1: Determination was performed by dilution method on plates of solid medium (Mueller-Hinton broth II).
2: Standard fungus culture was cultivated for 2024 hours at 3537C temperature on Mueller-Hinton agar.
3: The suspension is made from the harvested culture in physiological sodium chloride (0.9%) solution, standardized with  McFarland standard indicator, which measures the turbidity of the suspension in the test tube.
4: Microbial suspensions are standardized when the indicator shows a value of 0.5 (this means that 1 ml of the microbial suspension contains 1.5  10 8 microbial cells).
5: 1 ml of the oleogel was transferred with the sterile pipette into a sterile graduated cylinder, which is mixed with 10 ml of molten rigid Mueller-Hinton medium and transferred to a Petri dish.
6: Concentration of essential oil of thyme ranged from 0.01 to 0.3%.
7: The antifungal effect of investigated gels on  Candida albicans culture was evaluated after 24 h and compared with control (gel without essential oil).
