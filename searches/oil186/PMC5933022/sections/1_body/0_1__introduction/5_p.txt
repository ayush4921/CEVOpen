0: Anhydrous colloidal silica is suitable for the formulation of oleogel with desired texture and chemical and physical stability.
1: The clear gel is formed when the material is characterized by a similar refractory index as Aerosil (1.48).
2: Incorporation of the silica into oil leads to an increase in viscosity, which is brought about by hydrogen bonding between the silica particles: 510 percent silica imparts a paste-like consistency on a range of oils [ 21].
3: Liquid paraffin and olive oil were chosen for the oleogel formulation with the goal of evaluating the influence of the oil origin on the texture and stability.
4: The composition of oleogel was optimized with response surface central composite design in order to get desirable textural properties.
