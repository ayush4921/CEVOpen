0: The positive identification (quality) of Ce-CMEO-NPs was determined by FT-IR on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrophotometer attached with ZnSe single crystals (Bruker, Billerica, United States) and data were analyzed using OPUS 7 spectroscopy software program.
1: The analysis was carried out in a mode of a horizontal attenuated total reflectance (ATR) cell and working conditions were retained as relative humidity of 30% and temperature of 27C.
2: The samples were placed on ZnSe single crystal and infrared (IR) spectra were documented with resolution of 4 cm -1 at a wave number of 5004000 cm -1 and baseline correction was undertaken to devoid of water vapor, CO 2, and other background air spectrum.
