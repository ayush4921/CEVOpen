0: The preparation of Ce-CMEO-NPs with different concentrations of CMEO was done as per methodology of  Ribeiro et al.
1: (2013).
2: Briefly, different ppm of CMEO (up to 1000 ppm) and Tween 80 at a ratio of 2:1 (v/v) were added to 100 mL of 4% chitosan solution and homogenized continuously for 10 min at 50 rpm under a magnetic stirrer.
3: Next, attained emulsion was incubated at 28  2C for 3 days to form Ce-CMEO-NPs.
4: The characterizations of prepared Ce-CMEO-NPs were assessed by FT-IR spectroscopy, SEM, Zeta potential and size, and  in vitro release of CMEO from Ce-CMEO-NPs.
