0: The  in vitro release of CMEO from Ce-CMEO-NPs was assessed by dialysis method as per the methodology of  Natrajan et al.
1: (2015).
2: Briefly, 5 mg of Ce-CMEO-NPs was dispersed in 5 mL of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) of pH 7.4 and 0.1 M and loaded into dialysis bag.
3: The dialysis was carried out in a beaker containing 50 mL of PBS (0.1 M) with 20% ethanol (99.99% pure) at 28C and pH of 1.5 and 7.4 for duration of 48 h under gentle agitation.
4: At definite time intervals (0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, and 48 h), the amount of CMEO releases from a dialysis bag was quantified spectrophotometrically (190350 nm) using calibration curve.
5: The CMEO release was calculated by the formula:
