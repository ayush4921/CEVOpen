0: The inhibitory activity of CMEO and Ce-CMEO-NPs on growth and production of DON and ZEA by  F. graminearum in maize grains was studied under laboratory conditions.
1: A quantity of 100 g pre-sterilized maize grains was inoculated with 10 L spore suspension (1  10 6 spores per mL) in 250 mL of Erlenmeyer flask and exposed to different concentrations of CMEO and Ce-CMEO-NPs (up to 1000 ppm) and thoroughly homogenized for 15 min at 160 rpm in a rotary shaker and incubated at 28C for 28 days.
2: The maize grains inoculated with fungi and not treated with either of CMEO or Ce-CMEO-NPs was referred as control.
3: Following the incubation period, fungal growth and mycotoxins were determined by spread plate and HPLC quantification techniques, respectively.
