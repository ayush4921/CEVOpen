0: The fungal growth in maize grains was determined as per our earlier described procedure of  Kalagatur et al.
1: (2018).
2: Following incubation, maize grains (10 g) were collected from test samples and suspended in 90 mL of sterile peptone water and homogenized for 15 min at 160 rpm using a rotary shaker.
3: Subsequently, decimal dilutions were performed and spread plated on CD agar plates and allowed to grow for 3 days at 28C.
4: The viability of fungi was determined in colony forming units (CFU) and expressed in log CFU/g.
