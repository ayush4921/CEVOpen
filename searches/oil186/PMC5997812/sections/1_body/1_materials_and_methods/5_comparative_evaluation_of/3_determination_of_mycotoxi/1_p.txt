0: The HPLC quantification of DON and ZEA was done as per our previously reported methodology of  Kumar et al.
1: (2016) and  Mudili et al.
2: (2014) with minor modifications.
3: Briefly, a portion of maize grains (25 g) is milled into fine powder under aseptic conditions and suspended in 250 mL solution of acetonitrile and water (60:40, v/v) and thoroughly homogenized for 2 h at 160 rpm under a rotary shaker.
4: The suspension was filtered through Whatman no.
5: 1 filter paper and subjected to centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min to obtain a clear supernatant.
6: Meanwhile, immunoaffinity columns of DON and ZEA were prepared as per procedure of manufacturer, and about 20 mL of the obtained clear supernatant was passed through immunoaffinity columns at speed of three to four drops per second.
7: The DON and ZEA were eluted in 1 mL of acetonitrile and used for HPLC quantification (Shimadzu, Japan).
8: Briefly, analysis was executed in reverse-phase using C18 column (250 mm  4.6 mm and 5 m thickness) and fluorescence detector at excitation and emission wavelengths of 334 and 450 nm for ZEA, and 365 and 455 nm for DON, respectively.
9: The solution of acetonitrile and water (50:50, v/v) was used as a mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.
10: The injection sample was filtered through 0.45 m syringe filters and 25 L was injected.
11: The calibration curves of DON and ZEA were constructed with a different concentration and peak area, and used to deduce the quantification of mycotoxins.
