0: The chemical constituent of CMEO was revealed using GC-MS (PerkinElmer Clarus 600 C, Waltham, United States) attached with DB-5MS silica fused column (30 m  0.25 mm; 0.25 m film thickness), flame-ionization detector (FID), and Turbo Mass software program.
1: Briefly, CMEO was diluted with acetone (10 L/mL) and 1 L was injected in a split mode of 1:30.
2: Helium (He) was carrier gas at a delivery rate of 1 mL/min.
3: The mass spectra of compounds were determined at an  m/ z range of 40450 and ionization energy of 70 eV under vacuum.
4: Identification of the compounds was carried out matching the mass spectra and retention indices of n-alkanes (C-9 to C-24) with NIST05.LIB/Wiley 8th Edition and literature of  Adams (2007), respectively.
5: The quantification of compounds was attained from GC peak areas with devoid of FID response correction factors.
