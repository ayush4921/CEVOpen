0: The antifungal mechanism of CMEO was evidenced by estimating the content of intracellular ROS in CMEO treated (up to MFC value of 618.3 ppm) and untreated control samples using DCFH-DA adopting a technique of  Liu et al.
1: (2010) with minor modification.
2: A different concentration of CMEO (up to MFC value) was mixed with 10 L spore suspension (1  10 6 spores per mL) in 96-well microtiter plate and total volume brought up to 100 L with CD broth and incubated for 7 days at 28C.
3: The sample not treated with CMEO was considered as a control.
4: Subsequently, samples were stained for 20 min with 5 M DCFH-DA.
5: The fluorescence intensity was determined at excitation of 495 nm and emission of 550 nm in a multimode reader (Biotek-H1M synergy, Germany) and percentage of intracellular ROS in CMEO-treated samples was determined with respect to the untreated control (100%).
6: The phase-contrast and fluorescent images were captured under an EVOS fluorescence microscope (Life Technologies, United States) at a magnification of 200 m.
