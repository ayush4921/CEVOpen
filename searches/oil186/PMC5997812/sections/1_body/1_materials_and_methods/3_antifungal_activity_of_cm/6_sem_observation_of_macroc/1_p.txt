0: The SEM observation study was undertaken to know the effect of CMEO on the micro-morphological structure of macroconidia.
1: The fungi were grown for 7 days on CD agar plates and 1 cm 2 of mycelia mat was collected and inoculated on to CD agar slides that contain MIC and MFC concentrations of CMEO and incubated for 7 days at 28C.
2: The fungi not treated with CMEO were control.
3: Next, mycelia were fixed on conducting dual side carbon tape and coated with gold using a sputter coater (Emitech, model no.
4: : SC7620) and dried out in CO 2 chamber.
5: The micro-morphological structure of macroconidia was captured in an environmental mode under SEM (FEI, model no.
6: : Quanta 200) at a magnification of 5000.
