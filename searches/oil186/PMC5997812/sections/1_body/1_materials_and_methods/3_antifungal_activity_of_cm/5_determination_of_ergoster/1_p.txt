0: The impact of CMEO on ergosterol content of  F. graminearum was determined following the methodology of  Silva et al.
1: (2010) and  Sellamani et al.
2: (2016) with minor modifications.
3: Different concentrations of CMEO (up to MFC value of 618.3 ppm) were exposed to 10 L spore suspension (1  10 6 spores per mL) in 100 mL CD broth of 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask and incubated for a period of 7 days at 28C.
4: Subsequently, the mycelia were separated from the broth employing Whatman no.
5: 1 filter paper.
6: A quantity of 5 mg of mycelia was used for determination of ergosterol and blended with 1 mL of ethanol, 5 mL of methanol, and 0.5 g of potassium hydroxide.
7: The mixture was kept in dark at 70C for 40 min and supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min and thoroughly mixed for 10 min with n-hexane (v/v, 1:1).
8: The blend was dried out at 60C using water bath and re-solubilized in 1 mL of methanol and quantification of ergosterol was deducted from the calibration curve of standard ergosterol and results were compared with CMEO untreated control.
9: A calibration curve for standard ergosterol was constructed with peak area vs. concentration of ergosterol using HPLC (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan).
10: The system was equipped with C18 column, 5 m thickness, 250 mm  4.60 mm (Phenomenex, CA, United States) and working conditions were as follows: stock solution of ergosterol was prepared in methanol, injecting volume was 25 L for both test and standard samples, UV detector was used with an excitation of 240 nm and emission of 300 nm wavelengths, and mobile phase was acetonitrile and water in a ratio of 6.5:3.5 (v/v) with a flow rate of 1 mL/min.
