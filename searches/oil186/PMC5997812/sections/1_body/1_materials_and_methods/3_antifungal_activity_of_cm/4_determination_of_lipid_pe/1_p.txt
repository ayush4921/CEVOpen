0: The effect of CMEO on lipid peroxidation of fungi was done as per methodology of  Gao et al.
1: (2016) with minor modifications.
2: Different concentrations of CMEO (up to MFC value of 618.3 ppm) along with 10 l of fungal spore suspension were added to 100 mL of CD broth in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask and incubated for 7 days at 28C, and fungal sample without CMEO was considered as a control.
3: Next, fungal mycelia were separated from broth by sieving through Whatman no.
4: 1 filter paper and used for estimation of lipid peroxidation.
5: The amount of malondialdehyde (MDA) present in the fungal sample was determined as an indicator of the level of lipid peroxidation.
6: The quantification of MDA was done using spectrometric-dependent lipid-peroxidation assay kit as per instructions from the manufacturer (Sigma-Aldrich).
