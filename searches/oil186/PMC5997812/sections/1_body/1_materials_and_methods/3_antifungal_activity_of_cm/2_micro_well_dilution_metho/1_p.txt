0: The antifungal effect of CMEO on  F. graminearum was determined in terms of MIC and MFC by the micro-well dilution method in 96-well microtiter plate adopting the methodology of  Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [CLSI] (2008) with minor modifications.
1: A volume of 10 L spore suspension (1  10 6 spores per mL) was added to wells of 96-well microtiter plate and blended with different concentrations of CMEO (up to 1000 ppm) and final volume was attuned to 100 L with CD broth.
2: The wells devoid of CMEO and with nystatin were control and reference, respectively.
3: The plate was incubated for 3 days at 28C.
4: Following, MIC was noticed as the minimum concentration of CMEO at no visible fungal growth was observed.
5: The incubation period was continued for 7 days at 28C and 10 L was spread on CD agar plates and allowed to grow for 3 days at 28C and MFC was noticed as the minimum concentration of CMEO at no visible fungal growth was observed on CD agar plates.
