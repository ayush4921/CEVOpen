0: Antifungal activity of CMEO was tested on mycotoxigenic  F. graminearum (DFRL FgM: 18), which was originally isolated from freshly harvested maize kernels in our earlier study ( Mudili et al., 2014).
1: The fungal culture was allowed to grow for 14 days at 28C on CD agar and spores were collected in sterile peptone water made up of 0.05% of Tween 80 by soft scrap, and the sum of spores was attained to 10 6 spores/mL using a hemocytometer and used in further studies.
2: The antifungal activity of CMEO was determined by the micro-well dilution method.
3: Furthermore, deleterious effects of CMEO on micromorphology of macroconidia were observed by SEM.
4: The mechanism of antifungal activity of CMEO was unveiled by comparing the content of intracellular ROS, lipid peroxidation, and ergosterol content of CMEO-treated fungi with untreated control fungi.
