0: Fusarium graminearum [telemorph Gibberella zeae (Schwein)] is a sporadic plant pathogen, causes Fusarium head blight (FHB) in barley and wheat, stalk rot and Gibberella ear rot in maize, and one of the utmost liable for economic setback in the agriculture and food industry worldwide ( Dweba et al., 2017).
1: F. graminearum infestation of agriculture commodities fetches the rancidity along with the loss in grain yield and quality, including texture, color, odor, and nutrition ( Morgavi et al., 2007;  Okeke et al., 2015).
2: As well,  F. graminearum is a prominent producer of hazardous Fusarium mycotoxins, including deoxynivalenol (DON), nivalenol (NIV), and zearalenone (ZEA), which were reported to cause deleterious health issues in the farm animals and humans, such as nephrotoxic, immunotoxic, neurotoxic, hepatotoxic, genotoxic, reproductive, and developmental defects ( Morgavi et al., 2007;  Venkataramana et al., 2014;  Kalagatur et al., 2017).
3: Besides, International Agency on Research and Cancer (IARC) has confirmed the carcinogenicity of Fusarium mycotoxins and classified into group 3 agents ( IARC, 1999).
4: Concerning these worries, the European Union (EU), Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), and various nations have recommended stringent regulatory levels for Fusarium mycotoxins in agricultural and food products ( JECFA, 2000;  European Commission, 2007).
