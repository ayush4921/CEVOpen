0: Regrettably,  F. graminearum and its risky toxins are coherent contaminants of wide range of agricultural commodities worldwide ( Richard et al., 2003;  Pasquali et al., 2016;  Tralamazza et al., 2016;  Ok et al., 2018).
1: Recently,  Beccari et al.
2: (2018) have detected the higher incidence of FHB in Durum wheat samples of central Italy and reported that 22% fungal species were  F. graminearum.
3: In Mediterranean countries of Europe,  Gorczyca et al.
4: (2018) have detected yield loss and contamination of mycotoxins in Durum wheat owed to FHB incidence.
5: In the same way,  Vogelgsang et al.
6: (2017) in Switzerland haev surveyed the incidence of DON and ZEA between 2007 and 2014 in wheat and noticed an overall mean concentration of 607 g/kg of DON and 39 g/kg of ZEA.
7: Intolerably, 11% and 7% of wheat samples were surpassed the EU regulatory limits of DON and ZEA, respectively, and found unfit for consumption.
8: Similarly,  Mallmann et al.
9: (2017) during 20082015 in Brazil have measured the prevalence of FHB and detected 73% and 38% of wheat samples, 67% and 41% of barley samples were contaminated with DON and ZEA, respectively.
10: Furthermore,  Kos et al.
11: (2017) in Serbia have noticed 260.11388, 260.49050, and 252.36280 g/kg of DON in maize samples during 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively.
12: Likewise,  Mudili et al.
13: (2014) and  Ramana et al.
14: (2011) too enlightened the prevalence of  F. graminearum in rice, finger millet, and maize grains originated from Southern region of India and perceived 7294 g/kg of DON attendance in freshly harvested maize grains.
