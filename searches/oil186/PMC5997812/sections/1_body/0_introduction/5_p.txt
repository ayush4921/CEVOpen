0: In the present study, CMEO was extracted from leaves by hydrodistillation technique and chemical profile was determined by GC-MS analysis.
1: The antifungal activity of CMEO on  F. graminearum was determined in terms of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) by micro-well dilution method, and further, it was confirmed by scanning electron microscopic (SEM) observation of macroconidia.
2: The antifungal mechanism of CMEO was revealed by determining the content of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation, and ergosterol.
3: The chitosan encapsulated CMEO nanoparticles (Ce-CMEO-NPs) were prepared by emulsification technique and characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), SEM, Zeta potential and size, and  in vitro release of essential oil.
4: Finally,  in vitro antifungal and antimycotoxin activities of CMEO and Ce-CMEO-NPs on  F. graminearum were comparatively evaluated in maize grains.
