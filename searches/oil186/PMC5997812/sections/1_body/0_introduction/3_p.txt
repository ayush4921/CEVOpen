0: The status quo apprehensions the insistent incidence of  F. graminearum and its toxins in agricultural commodities, and demand effective approaches from microbiologists and food technologists to overcome these problems in agriculture and food industry.
1: However, the application of synthetic fungicides has not been acceptable because of increasing concern on multiple drug resistance, environmental safety, and deleterious health issues in humans and animals.
2: Over the last decade, plant-originated mycobiocides, exclusively essential oils have attained a considerable attention as of its non-toxic and eco-friendly ( Hyldgaard et al., 2012;  Kalagatur et al., 2015;  George et al., 2016;  Iram et al., 2016;  Kumar et al., 2016;  Vanhoutte et al., 2016;  Muniyandi et al., 2017).
3: In recent times, nanotechnology has provided great assistance to improve the microbiological safety of food and feed matrices.
4: Particularly, nanomaterials of chitosan were found eco-friendly and safe, and their application in food is highly satisfactory by consumer, food industry, and regulatory agencies ( Yeung et al., 2016;  Niaz et al., 2017;  Siddaiah et al., 2018).
5: Furthermore, essential oils are volatile and lose their stability and bio-functional features on exposure to temperature, light, pH, moisture, and oxygen ( Jamil et al., 2016).
6: In this context, the encapsulation of essential oils with chitosan by nanotechnology approach was recognized as a finest approach to safeguard the stability and bio-functional features of essential oils ( Barreto et al., 2016;  Yeung et al., 2016).
