0:  Effect of Pinus roxburghii on NF-B activation.
1: Pinus roxburghii suppresses TNF-induced NF-B activation in a dose-dependent manner.
2: KBM-5 cells (2.010 6 cells/mL) were pre-incubated with PREO (0, 10, 25, 50 g/mL) for 8 h and then treated with 0.1 nM TNF for 30 min.
3: Nuclear extracts were prepared and assayed for NF-B activation by EMSA (left panel).
4: Values below the EMSA gel indicate percent growth inhibition.
5: Percent inhibition of NF-B by PREO was calculated by quantitation of NF-B bands using a Storm 820 phosphorimager equipped with ImageQuant software (Amersham) (right panel).
6: Data represent the meanSD of three measurements.
7: *p<0.05, versus control. )
