0:  HCT-116 cells were seeded in 96-well plates 2.010 4.
1: After 12 h, cells were treated with (25, 50 and 100 g/mL) concentrations of PREO for 24 h, removed the media and washed with PBS.
2: Cells were then stained with assay reagents for 30 min at ambient temperature.
3: Cell cytotoxicity was determined by live/dead assay.
4: Data represent the meanSD of three field measurements. )
