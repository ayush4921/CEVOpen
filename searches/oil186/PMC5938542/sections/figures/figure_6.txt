1: KBM-5 cells were treated (10, 25, 50 and 100 g/ml) of PREO for 24 h. Whole cell protein extracts were prepared, separated by electrophoresis, and then transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane.
2: The membrane was sliced according to molecular weight to probe with different antibodies.
3: After stripping, the membrane was reprobed with -actin to verify equal protein loading. )
