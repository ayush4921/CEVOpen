0: Chemical composition of  P. roxburghii (needles, stem, bark and essential oil) have been studied well (Iqbal et al., 2011[ 28]; Qadir and Shah, 2014[ 43]; Satyal et al., 2013[ 46]) and caryophyllene, thunbergol, 3-carene, cembrene and -pinene were the major constituents in  P. roxburghii extracts (Hassan and Amjid, 2009[ 25]; Salem et al., 2014[ 44]).
1: In view of considerable anticancer activities of  Pinacea family plants, it will be of worth to study the anticancer activity of  P. roxburghii plant.
2: Therefore, the present investigation was conducted to appraise the anticancer potential of  P. roxburghii leaves essential oil using different human cancer cell lines.
3: Moreover, chemical composition of  P. roxburghii essential oil (PREO) was also evaluated using advanced techniques.
4: For anticancer activity evaluation of PREO, initially, different cell lines were used.
5: After initial trails, two types of cells i.e., adherent (A549, HCT-116) and suspension (U-266, KBM-5) were selected.
6: For colony forming assay adherent cancer cell lines line HCT 116 are required, whereas KBM-5 cell line was used to study apoptosis effect of PREO.
