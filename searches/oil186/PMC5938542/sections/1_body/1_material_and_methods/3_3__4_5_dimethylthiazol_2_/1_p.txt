0: PREO effect on the proliferation of cancer cell was determined by measuring the mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity using MTT assay.
1: This assay relies on the mitochondrial dehydrogenases of viable cells which cleave the tetrazolium ring of MTT and yields formazan form, which is monitored at 570 nm (ELISA micro plate reader, Bio-Tek, USA).
2: Cells were seeded at a concentration of 5.010 3 cells/0.1 mL in a 96-well plate for 12 h at 37 C in a humidified incubator in the presence of 5 % CO 2 (CO 2 Incubator, Forma Scientific, USA).
3: PREO was dissolved in DMSO and cells were treated in triplicate with 10, 25, 50 and 100 g/mL oil concentrations (with this solution being added to the appropriate growth media to yield a final DMSO concentration of 0.1 % and final mixture was incubated for 72 h at 37 C).
4: Then, 20 L MTT (5 mg/mL) solutions were added and again contents were incubated for 2 h at 37 C. Finally, 100 L buffers (cell lysis) was added and incubated overnight at 37  oC.
5: The optical density of the suspension was measured at 570 nm using MRX Revelation 96-well multiscanner (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA) (Sankara et al., 2013[ 45]).
6: The percentage residual cell viability was determined using relation shown in Eq.
7: 1.
8: Where, OD s and OD c are the optical densities of sample and control, respectively.
