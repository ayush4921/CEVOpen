0: KBM-5 cells were seeded in 12-well plates (2.010 6 cells/1 mL), incubated for 2 h at 37 C and treated with 10, 25 and 50 g/mL PREO concentrations.
1: After 8 h of incubation, cells were harvested and washed twice with cold PBS.
2: Swelling induction in cell was induced by adding cold cytoplasmic extraction buffer and content was kept in ice for 15 min.
3: The cytoplasmic cell fraction was lysed by adding 3.125 L, 10 % Igepal (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)/100 L CEB and mixed on vortex for 20 sec.
4: Then, suspension was centrifuged for 5 min and cytosolic supernatant was discarded and cold nuclear extraction buffer was added to the pellet.
5: Nuclear suspension was incubated for 30 min on ice (mixed the contents after every 5 min on vertex) and then, centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min.
6: Nuclear protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay.
7: The binding reaction was initiated by adding 15 g nuclear extract to binding buffer (100 M HEPES, pH7.9; 50 MEDTA; 100 MDTT; and 10 % glycerol), 2 g poly (dI:dC) (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), 3.0 10 5 counts per minute 32P-labeled 45-mer double-stranded NF-B oligo nucleotide (15 g of protein with 16fmol DNA) from the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat (5-TTGTTACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGG ACTTTC CAGGGAGGCGTGG-3) and 1 % Igepal (total volume, 20 L) and incubated the mixture for 30 min at 37 C. The reaction was terminated by adding 4 L 6X DNA loading dye and sample was placed on ice and then, loaded on a pre-run 6.6 % polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
8: A double-stranded mutated oligonucleotide (5-TTGTTACAACTCACTTTCCGCTGCTCA CTTTCCAGGGAGGCGTGG-3) was used to examine the specificity of binding of NF-B to the DNA.
9: The gel was dried and placed on film for autoradiography (Han et al., 2014[ 24]).
