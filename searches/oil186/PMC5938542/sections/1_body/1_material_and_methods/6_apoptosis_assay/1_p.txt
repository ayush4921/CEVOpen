0: For determination of apoptotic effects of PREO on colon cancer cells, Live/dead assay kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) method was used, which determines the intracellular esterase activity and plasma membrane integrity.
1: Intracellular esterases from live cells convert nonfluorescent, cell-permeable calceinacetoxy methyl ester to the intensely green fluorescent calcein, a polyanionic dye which was retained within cells.
2: This assay was also used to examine the damaged membrane of cells (the ethidium bromide homodimer-1 enters damaged cells when bound to nucleic acids, it produces a bright red fluorescence).
3: HCT-116 cells were seeded in 96-well plates 2.010 4/well.
4: After 12 h, cells were treated with 25, 50 and 100 g/mL PREO concentrations for 24 h and then, washed with PBS (Gupta et al., 2011[ 20]).
