0: The PREO effect on protein expression was studied using KBM-5 cells following method reported elsewhere (Buhrmann et al., 2013[ 11]).
1: In colony forming assay adherent cancer cell lines are required and HCT-116 is a type of adherent cell line, so far, it was for colony and apoptosis assay instead of KBM-5.
2: Briefly, KBM-5 (2.010 6) cells were seeded in 12-well plates for 2 h at 37 C and treated with 10, 25, 50 and 100 g/mL PREO concentrations for 24 h at 37 C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (14000 rpm for 30 sec at 4 C), washed twice with cold PBS.
3: Prepared cells mixed with cell lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8, 0.1 % Triton X-100, 0.01 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.005 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.4 mM phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride, and 4 mM NaVO 4) for 20 min.
4: The contents were centrifuged for 10 min at 14000 rpm and supernatant was collected for further analysis.
5: Protein contents were measured by Bradford assay.
6: Proteins were separated on 10 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and proteins were electro-transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using Trans-Blot apparatus (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) and blocked for 1 h in 5 % (w/v) skimmed milk powder in PBS/0.1 % Tween 20.
7: Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated overnight (4 C) with the primary antibody directed against MMP-9, cyclinD1, PARP, c-IAP2, Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, c-Myc, -actin, c-FLIP, survivin and caspase-3 at a 1:3,000 dilution in blocking buffer at 4 C on a shaker, washed thrice with washing buffer and then, incubated with secondary antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase for 90 min at ambient temperature.
8: Membranes were washed five times.
9: Specific antigen-antibody complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) using ECL reagent (GE Healthcare).
