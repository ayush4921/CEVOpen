0: Human cancer cell lines i.e., HCT-116 (human colon cancer), KBM-5 (human myelogenous leukemia), U-266 (human multiple myeloma cells), MiaPaCa-2 (human pancreatic cancer cells), A-549 (human lung carcinoma cells), SCC-4 (squamous cell carcinoma) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.
1: The HCT-116, MiaPaCa-2 and A-549 cells were cultured in DMEM, the U-266 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium, whereas KBM-5 cells were cultured in Iscove's DMEM.
2: DMEM and RPMI media were supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS), whereas Iscove's DMEM supplemented with 15 % FBS with 1 % antibiotics (100 U penicillin/mL and 100 mg streptomycin/mL) (Gibco, USA) was used.
