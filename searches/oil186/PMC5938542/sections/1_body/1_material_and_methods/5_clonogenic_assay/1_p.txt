0: Cells were grown and colonized by clonogenic assay.
1: HCT-116 cells were seeded in 6-well plates 1.010 3 cells/well.
2: After 24 h, cells were treated with essential oil 25, 50 and 100 g/mL concentrations, incubated at 37 C for 48 h and subjected to clonogenic assay as reported elsewhere (Gupta et al., 2013[ 19]).
