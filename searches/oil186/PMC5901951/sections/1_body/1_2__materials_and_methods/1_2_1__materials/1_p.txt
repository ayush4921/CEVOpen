0: The trees from which we obtained tree-borne seed oils for this study were MPA, JCT, KOE, JLT, TUT, and ORT.
1: Samples were harvested and collected by Southern Forest Resources Research Center, Jinju, Republic of Korea, in 2016, and oils were extracted from seed endosperm, for which seed coats and impurities were removed manually.
2: For solvent extraction, samples were mixed with  n-hexane (10 times sample weight) and stirred at 4C for 12 h, followed by concentration using a stream of nitrogen (N 2) gas, resulting in fat-soluble substances, which were used for experiments [ 12].
