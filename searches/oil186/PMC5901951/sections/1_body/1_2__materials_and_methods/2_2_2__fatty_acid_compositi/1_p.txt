0: To identify fatty acid composition of the extracted tree-borne seed oils, the seed oils were derivatized to methyl ester using boron trifluoride- (BF3-) methanol before analysis [ 13].
1: Approximately 0.1 g of tree-borne seed oils were collected in test tubes, to which 0.5 mL heptadecanoic acid (C17 : 0) (1 mg/mL hexane) was added as an internal reference.
2: After adding 2 mL of 0.5 M NaOH methanol to the test tubes, the tube was heated at 110C for 10 min using a Reacti-Therm III Heating/Stirring Module (Thermo Fisher Scientific Co., Rockford, IL, USA), which was then cooled to room temperature, and heated again at 110C after adding 4 mL BF3-methanol for 1 h. After cooling, 2 mL hexane was added to the sample mix and vortexed for 1 min, followed by collection of the hexane layer.
3: Solvent was removed from the hexane layer collected through three repetitions of hexane addition and extraction using nitrogen gas, and then the remaining residue was dissolved with 1 mL hexane again, which was used as the sample for fatty acid analysis.
4: Fatty acids of tree-borne seed oils were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) using Agilent Technologies 6890N (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
5: An SP-2560 capillary column (100 m  0.25 mm i.d., 0.25  m film thickness; Agilent Technologies) was used as the column for analysis, and nitrogen (2.7 mL/min) was used as carrier gas.
6: Temperature of the inlet and the detector was 250C.
7: The sample ratio to the inlet was set to 10 : 1, and rates of hydrogen and air for flame ionization at the detector were set to 40 mL and 450 mL/min, respectively.
8: The initial oven temperature was 130C for 5 min and gradually increased to 240C by 4C/min, and maintained at 240C for 15 min.
9: Analyzed results were identified by retention time on the basis of 37 fatty acids reference standards (Supelco 37 FAME, Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA).
