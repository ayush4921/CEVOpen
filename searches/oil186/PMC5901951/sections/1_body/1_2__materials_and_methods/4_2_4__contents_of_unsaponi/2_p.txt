0: For phytosterol analysis, derivatization was performed by using the trimethylsilyl group.
1: Unsaponifiables were mixed with 0.5 mL of BSTFA (N, O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide + trimethylchlorosilane) that contained 1% trimethylsilyl chloride and 1 mL pyridine, and dissolved again, followed by induction of reaction at 80C for 1 h. After completion of the reaction, samples were slowly cooled at room temperature and filtered with a 0.45  m filter to remove particles, which were used as samples for phytosterol analysis.
2: Phytosterol was analyzed by gas chromatography, for which HP-5 column (30 m  0.32 mm i.d., 0.25  m in film thickness; Agilent Technologies) was used, and helium (2.7 mL/min) was used as the carrier gas.
3: The oven temperature was 260C at the beginning, increased to 300C by 3C/min, and then maintained at 300C for 15 min.
4: Temperature of the inlet and the detector was 300C and 320C, respectively, and the split ratio was 10 : 1.
5: Detection was performed by a flame ionization detector.
6: For identification and measurement of phytosterols, each reference standard, campesterol, stigmasterol, and  -sitosterol, was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co., and retention time and peak area were used for identification.
7: Phytosterol quantification was performed using 5 -cholestane as the internal standard.
8: To accurately quantify the phytosterols in oils, relative response factors (RRFs) to 5 -cholestane were determined based on three replicate analyses.
9: The RRFs were determined according to the following equation: (1)RRF=PAsterolWsterolWisPAis,where PA sterol is the peak area of the sterol, W sterol is the mass (mg) of the sterol, PA is is the peak area of the internal standard, and W is is the mass (mg) of the internal standard.
