0: Contents of unsaponifiables in tree-borne seed oils, particularly phytosterols, the representative unsaponifiables, were analyzed by an alkaline saponification method [ 10].
1: We mixed 0.5 g of extracted seed oils with 0.5 mL 5 -cholestane (1 mg/mL hexanes), an internal reference, followed by addition of 8 mL of 3% ( w/ v) pyrogallol-ethanol solution for antioxidative capacity and 1 mL saturated potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution, which was then well mixed, saponified at 80C for 1 h, and cooled in an ice bucket.
2: For extraction, 10 mL distilled water and 7 mL hexanes were added to the sample mix and then the supernatant corresponding to the hexane layer was separated.
3: Extraction of the hexane layer was repeated three times.
4: The solvent was completely evaporated from the separated hexane layer under nitrogen gas to concentrate the residue.
5: Weight of the completely concentrated residue was measured and compared with input sample amount, by which residue weight was calculated as the ratio of unsaponifiables.
