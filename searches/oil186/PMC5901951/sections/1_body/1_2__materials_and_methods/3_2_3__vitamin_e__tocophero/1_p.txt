0: To identify tocopherol contents in tree-borne seed oils, the solvent extraction method was used [ 9].
1: For pretreatment of samples, 1 g oil was mixed with hexane up to 50 mL and homogenized for 30 s, and this mixture was passed through a 0.45  m nylon membrane filter (GE Osmonics Lab Store, Minnetonka, MN, USA).
2: A normal-phase HPLC system (Agilent 1260, Agilent Technologies) with a fluorescence detector was used for analysis.
3: The column for separation was LiChrosorb Si-60 column (4 mm  250 mm, 5  m particle size; Hibar Fertigsaule RT, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in a normal phase condition.
4: Mobile phase was 0.85% isopropanol/hexane, and flow rate was set as 1 mL/min.
5: Wavelengths of the detector for vitamin E analysis were 290 nm for excitation and 330 nm for emission.
6: For quantification of tocopherol, reference standards for  -,  -,  -, and  -tocopherol were used.
7: To assess purity of each tocopherol, the reference standards were dissolved in 25 mL ethanol, and then extinction coefficients were measured by a UV-spectrophotometer (DU-62, Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA, USA).
8: Wavelengths for each isomer were 294 ( -T), 297 ( -T), 298 ( -T), and 298 ( -T) nm.
9: Purity of  -,  -,  -, and  -tocopherol was 99.07%, 82.47%, 98.71%, and 89.16%, respectively.
10: When judged based on purity of the reference standards, concentrations of stock solutions for  -,  -,  -, and  -tocopherols were 1.96, 1.65, 3.65, and 1.80 mg/mL, respectively, and the standard solutions were stored at 40C for further use.
11: For the calibration of each tocopherol, concentrations range for  -,  -,  -, and  -tocopherols were 0.251.96, 0.211.65, 0.463.65, and 0.231.80 mg/mL, respectively.
