0: Following transfer of 5 g tree-borne seed oils to Petri dishes for color scale analysis, color scale was measured by a color difference meter (CR-300, Konica Minolta Inc., Tokyo, Japan).
1: Each of  L (0/100 darkness/lightness),  a (, redness/greenness), and  b (, yellowness/blueness) in the Hunter scale were measured three times, from which mean values were calculated.
2: Values of the standard plate, used as a reference, were  L = 93.59,  a = 2.62, and  b = 1.88.
3: To measure brown color intensity that is related with browning of seed oils, 200  L seed oils were added to a 96-well plate, and OD was measured at 420 nm using a spectrophotometer (Multiskan Go, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
4: A higher OD value was considered as a higher brown color intensity of oil [ 11].
