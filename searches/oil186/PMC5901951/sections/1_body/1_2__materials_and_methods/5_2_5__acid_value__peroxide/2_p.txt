0: Peroxide value of seed oils were measured using the AOCS method [ 15].
1: After collecting 1 g oil in a 250 mL conical flask, oil samples were dissolved with 25 mL of solution mixed with acetic acid-chloroform in 3 : 2 ( v/ v) ratio, to which 1 mL saturated potassium iodide (KI) solution was added.
2: The mix was then shaken for 1 min, incubated in a dark condition for 10 min, and mixed well with 75 mL distilled water.
3: Then, 1 mL of 1% starch solution was added, and the solution was titrated with 0.01 N sodium thiosulfate (Na 2S 2O 3) solution until it became transparent.
4: Peroxide value was finally identified through a mock experiment without sample.
