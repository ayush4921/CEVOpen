0: Acid value of tree-borne seed oils was measured using the American Oil Chemist's Society (AOCS) method [ 14].
1: After adding 1 g oil to a 150 mL conical flask, 30 mL of the solution was mixed with ethanol-ether in 1 : 1 ( v/ v) ratio to dissolve oils.
2: To this solution, we added (and mixed well) 100  L of 1% phenolphthalein as an indicator and then the mix was titrated with 0.1 M potassium hydroxide (KOH)/ethanol solution until it became light red.
3: Acid value was finally identified through a mock experiment without sample.
