0: To identify amounts of aldehydes and ketones that are secondary oxidation products generated during acidification of seed oils,  p-AV was utilized.
1: After mixing 100 mg oil with 25 mL isooctane, optical density (OD) was measured at 350 nm.
2: Following reaction of 2.5 mL of this solution with 0.5 mL of 0.25% ( w/ v)  p-anisidine/acetic acid solution for 15 min, OD was measured at the same wavelength.
3: In this way, OD values before and after reaction with anisidine solution were measured to find  p-AV value [ 16].
