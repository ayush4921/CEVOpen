0: In modern society, forest plants and their products have been increasingly viewed as useful resources, which have prompted research on applications of plant-based products and utilization of associated organic compounds with diverse physiological activities [ 1].
1: Given the potential utility of plant-based products, in particular plant-based oils, it is surprising that relatively few studies have been conducted on oil resources of forest trees, which may be an important source of functional chemical substances.
2: In general, vegetable oils are obtained from grains, and their major components are fatty acids, accounting for over 90% of ester forms.
3: Vegetable fats contain more unsaturated fatty acids than animal fats, and unsaturated fatty acids have important nutritional and functional properties.
4: In particular, many seed oils contain high levels of unsaturated fatty acids.
5: Of them, the n-6 series of linoleic acid (C18 : 2) generate conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), through microbial or chemical reactions, which is an isomer known to have useful functions in the human body [ 2,  3].
6: In addition, the n-3 series of alpha-linolenic acid (C18 : 3, n-3), which are particularly representative fatty acids of perilla oil, can be converted to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20 : 5, n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22 : 6, n-3) by desaturation and chain elongation in human bodies [ 4,  5].
7: These n-3 series of fatty acids are essential to synthesize brain phospholipids and are known to improve brain function, including learning ability [ 6].
8: Vegetable fats also contain high levels of phytosterols and vitamin E, thus have antioxidant activity; these constituents confer oxidative stability for food processing, storage, and distribution [ 7,  8].
