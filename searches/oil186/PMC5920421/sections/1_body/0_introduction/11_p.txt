0: Others two papers are related to the effect of thyme and savory EOs on specific foods: Santoro et al.
1: [ 11] reported the effect on the control of postharvest diseases and quality of peaches and nectarines, while Banani et al.
2: [ 12] reported its efficacy on apples.
3: In the first work the authors concluded that both EOs favor a reduction of brown rot incidence (caused by  Monilinia fructicola) but increased gray mold (caused by  Botrytis cinerea).
4: Respect to the overall quality of the fruits, both EOs showed a positive effect in reducing weight loos and in maintaining ascorbic acid and carotenoid content.
5: Regarding the second study, apples treated with these EOs showed lower gray mold severity and incidence and the authors reported that the PR-8 gene of apple may play a key role in the mechanism implicated in this inhibition.
