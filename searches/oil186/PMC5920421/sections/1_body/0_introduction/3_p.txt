0: One of the most important aspects that has changed along time is the way in which essential oil has been applied in foods.
1: The first method of application was directly added essential oil to the food matrix, which showed special limitations mainly associated with intrinsic obstacles such as their low water solubility, high volatility, low stability, bioavailability, and strong odor.
2: EOs are unstable volatile compounds which can be degraded easily (by oxidation, volatilization, heating, light, etc.)
3: when they are added to the food matrix.
4: It must be taken into account that most of the food elaboration processes include heat treatment or air and light exposition, all of them factors that increase their degradation.
5: For these reasons, several protection methods to increase their action duration and to provide a controlled release during the shelf-life of food have been proposed.
6: Encapsulation has emerged as a useful alternative to enhance EO stability.
7: The encapsulation of EOs using different materials and methods has been widely studied [ 2].
8: EOs have been encapsulated in polymeric particles, liposomes, and solid lipid nanoparticles, which enhanced its stability and efficacy.
9: The recent advances in nanotechnology have made possible the development of novel carrier agents for the delivery and control release of EOs in food system with enhanced chemical, oxidative, and thermal stability [ 3].
10: Although nanoencapsulation is a promising tool for effective delivery of EOs into food, the toxicological aspects of most of the nanocarriers and their molecular target site must be further explored.
