1: [ 9] have focused their study in EOs from four Thymus species from organic growth, contributing to their potential application to organic food processing.
2: Taking into account that thymus is a common specie in the Spain meat industry, the work has assessed its antioxidant and antibacterial properties with the objective of its use for the meat industry.
3: The main novelty of this work is the application, as culture medium for the antibacterial activity evaluation, and of several meat homogenates (minced beef, cooked ham, or dry-cured sausage).
4: This type of study allows that the potential effect of these meat matrices on bacterial survival would be included in the general antibacterial activity that has been evaluated.
