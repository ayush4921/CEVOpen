0: EOs have also been used as additives in biodegrabable films and coatings for active food packaging [ 4, 5].
1: EOs can provide the films and coatings with antioxidant and/or antimicrobial properties, depending both on their composition and on the interactions with the polymer matrix.
2: The antioxidant activity depends not only on the specific antioxidant activity of the oil compounds but also on the films oxygen permeability.
3: The incorporation into edible films can promote the antimicrobial capacity of EOs, and the effectiveness of the edible film against microbial growth will depend on the oils nature and the type of microorganism.
4: EOs controlled release from edible films is another aspect that positively affects their effectiveness.
5: In addition, consumers concern regarding possible negative health effects of applying synthetic preservatives to food products together with the boom of organic culture that promotes the consumption of organic foods (in whose processing synthetic additives are not authorized) have also contribute to boost the interest in organic EOs properties.
