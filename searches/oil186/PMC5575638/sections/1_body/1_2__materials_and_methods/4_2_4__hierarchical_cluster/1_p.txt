0: The chemical compositions of  A. sativum from this current study along with garlic oil compositions from previously published works (hydrodistillations and steam distillations only) [ 6, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30] were used as operational taxonomic units (OTUs).
1: The percentages of the major sulfur-containing compounds (diallyl sulfide, allyl methyl disulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, diallyl disulfide, allyl ( Z)-1-propenyl disulfide, allyl ( E)-1-propenyl disulfide, allyl methyl trisulfide, 2-vinyl-4 H-1,3-dithiine, diallyl trisulfide, and diallyl tetrasulfide) were used to evaluate the chemical similarities and differences between the garlic oil samples by agglomerative hierarchical cluster (AHC) analysis using the XLSTAT software, version 2015.4.01 (AddinsoftTM, New York, NY, USA).
2: Pearson correlation was used to evaluate similarity and clusters were defined by the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic averaging (UPGMA).
