0: GC-MS characterization of  A. sativum oils was carried out as previously described using a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 Ultra (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD, USA) [ 15, 16].
1: This instrument was operated in the electron impact (EI) mode set at electron energy 70 eV with a scan range of 40400 amu, a scan rate of 3.0 scans per second, and with GC-MS solution software.
2: A ZB-5 fused silica capillary column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA), 30 m length  0.25 mm inner diameter, with a (5% phenyl)-polymethylsiloxane stationary phase and a film thickness of 0.25 m was used as the GC column.
3: Helium was used as the carrier gas and the pressure was set at 551.6 kPa with a flow rate of 1.37 mL/min on the column head.
4: The temperature of the injector was set at 250 C and the temperature of the ion source was set at 200 C. The temperature of the GC oven was programmed to be 50 C initially and was programmed to increase at a rate of 2 C/min to a final temperature of 260 C. The samples were prepared with CH 2Cl 2 in a 5%  w/ v solution.
5: Then, 0.1 L of the solutions were injected into the instrument with a split ratio of 30:1.
