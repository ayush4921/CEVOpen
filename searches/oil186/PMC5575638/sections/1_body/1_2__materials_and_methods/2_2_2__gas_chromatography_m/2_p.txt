0: GC-MS analysis of  A. vineale oils was carried out as previously described [ 17]: Agilent 6890 GC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), Agilent 5973 mass selective detector (Agilent Technologies), EI mode (70 eV), 40400 mass scan range, 3.99 scans/s scan rate, and operated through an Agilent ChemStation data system (G1701CA, Agilent Technologies); HP-5ms capillary column (30 m length  0.25 mm inner diameter  0.25 m film thickness), helium carrier gas, head pressure (92.4 kPa), flow rate (1.5 mL/min); oven temperature program (60 C initial temperature, which was held for 5 min, temperature increased at a rate of 3 C/min up to 280 C), inlet temperature (250 C), interface temperature (280 C).
1: Allium vineale solutions (1 L of 1% in CH 2Cl 2) were injected using a splitless mode.
