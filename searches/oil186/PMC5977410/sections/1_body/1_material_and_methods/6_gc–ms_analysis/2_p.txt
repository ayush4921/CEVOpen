0: GC/MS (EI mode, scan range of  m/ z 50550 and ionization energy of 70 eV) data were measured on the same gas chromatograph coupled with MSD 5975.
1: MS source temperature at 230 C; MS quadrapole temperature at 150 C; MSD transfer line was maintained at 280 C. The HP-INNOWax capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm, 0.25 m film thickness) was directly coupled to the MS; the other parameters were the same as with GC analysis.
