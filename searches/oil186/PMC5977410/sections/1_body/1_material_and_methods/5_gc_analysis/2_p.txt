0: GC analysis was performed on a 6890 series instrument (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) standard model with Flame Ionization Detectors (FID) using the following conditions: fused silica capillary column with a polar stationary phase HP-INNOWax (30 m  0.25 mm i.d, 0.25 m film, polyethylene glycol).
1: Helium used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, injector and detector temperature are 250 and 280 C, respectively.
2: The splitless injection mode was used with injection volume of 1 l diluted in hexane 1%.
3: The oven temperature was programmed at 60 C for 8 min, and then progressed to 270 C at 2 C/min.
