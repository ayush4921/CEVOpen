0: The human lung epithelial cells (A549) were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 U/ml penicillinstreptomycin at 5% CO 2 and 37 C. At 85% confluence, cells were harvested utilizing 0.25% trypsin and were sub-cultured into 75 cm 2 flasks, 96-well or 12-well plates according to selection of experiments.
1: Cells were allowed to attach the surface for 24 h prior to treatment.
2: NiO NPs were suspended in cell culture medium and diluted to appropriate concentrations (0.5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 g/ml) for 24 h. The appropriate dilutions of NiO NPs were then sonicated using a sonicator bath at room temperature for 10 min at 40W to avoid nanoparticles agglomeration prior to administration to the cells.
3: Cells were treated with PLEO at concentration of 60 and 80 g/ml for 24 h before exposure to NiO NPs (80 and 100 g/ml).
4: Essential oil samples were dissolved in DMSO and diluted in the medium (final concentration of DMSO in the medium was<0.3%)
