0: Viability of cells after exposure to NiO NPs was assessed by MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay as described by Mosmann (1983) [ 33], whereas the production of intracellular ROS was measured using 2,7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) [ 34].
1: Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a concentration of 1  10 4 cells/well and exposed to NiO NPs or/with PLEO at the concentrations for 24 h.
