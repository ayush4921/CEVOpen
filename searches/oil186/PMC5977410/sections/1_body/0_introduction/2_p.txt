0: The rapid development of nanotechnology has exposed man and his environment to a number of exotic metals.
1: In the recent years, overgrowing nanotechnology industries have led to the large-scale production of engineered nanoparticles (NPs), especially the metal NPs, for various uses [ 1].
2: Nanoparticles are defined as particles with a diameter of less than 100 nm in one structural dimension.
3: Compared to the same materials with micrometer scale dimensions, nanomaterials have specific properties, such as small size, large surface area, shape, and special structure [ 2].
