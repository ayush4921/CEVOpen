0: Oxidative stress, which is an imbalance between ROS (reactive oxygen species) production and the antioxidant systems favoring a ROS excess, has been identified as a common mechanism for cell damage.
1: This imbalance can be amplified by aging, smoking, diseases and some kinds of food [ 11].
2: During oxidative stress, ROS are produced mainly from the mitochondrial electron transport chain.
3: In addition, nanoparticles have been demonstrated to generate more free radicals and reactive oxygen species than larger particles, likely due to their higher surface area [ 12].
4: The inverse correlation between cell viabilities and the ROS level proved that oxidative stress is probably a key route by which nanoparticles induce cytotoxicity [ 11].
