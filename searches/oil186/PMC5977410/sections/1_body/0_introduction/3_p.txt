0: NPs of many different metal oxides are currently being used in numerous applications, we give as examples: magnetic resonance imaging, drug delivery, electronics, catalysis, optical devices [ [3],  [4]]; as well as consumer products like cosmetics, sunscreens, sports accessories, inks and pigments, etc.
1: [ 5].
2: Due to the growing number of applications and the recent development of combustion-based engine transportation [ 6], there is an increasing risk for human, environment and exposure to NPs.
3: Their potential toxicological impacts are still a matter of investigation and our actual knowledge on the effects of nano-sized contaminants on biological systems remains incomplete [ 7].
4: Their use also (which is still largely unregulated) has become a recognized social health problem because the inhalation, dermal absorption or ingestion of particles of various sizes and compositions leads to increased rates of chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases [ 8].
