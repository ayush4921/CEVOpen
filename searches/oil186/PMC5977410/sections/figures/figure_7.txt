0:  (A) Effects of NiO NPs and PLEO on CAT activity in A549 cells.
1: Cells were treated with different concentrations for 24 h. H 2O 2 was used as a negative control.
2: (B) PLEO attenuates NiO NPs decreased CAT activity.
3: A549 cells were treated with different concentrations of essential oils for 24 h followed by NiO NPs for 24 h also.
4: Data represented are mean  SD of three independent experiments.
