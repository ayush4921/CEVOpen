0:  (A) Effects of NiO NPs and PLEO on SOD activity in A549 cells.
1: Cells were treated with different concentrations for 24 h. H 2O 2 was used as a negative control.
2: (B) P. lentiscus essential oil attenuates NiO NPs decreased SOD activity.
3: A549 cells were treated with different concentrations of essential oils for 24 h followed by NiO NPs for 24 h also.
4: Data represented are mean  SD of three independent experiments.
5: ** p < 0.01 treatments compared to control; = p < 0.05 and # p < 0.01compared to NiO. )
