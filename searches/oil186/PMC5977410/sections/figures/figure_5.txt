0:  Intracellular ROS generation in A549 cells.
1: Images were captured with a fluorescence microscope (OLYMPUS IX73).
2: Effects of NiO NPs (A) and PLEO (B) on ROS production.
3: Cells were treated with different concentrations for 24 h. (C) PLEO attenuate NiO NPs induced ROS generation in dose-dependent manner.
4: A549 cells were treated with different concentrations of essential oil for 24 h followed by NiO NPs for 24 h also. )
