0:  Comparative effect of the essential oils on HEK293T against RRV.
1: Viability of HEK293T cells infected with RRV-T48 (MOI 2) upon treatment with chloroquine at the concentration 20 g.mL -1and essential oil at the concentration 1 CC 10 at 24 h post-infection ( A); Inhibition of RRV- renLuc replication at MOI 2 using co-treatment of chloroquine at the concentration 20 g.mL -1and essential oil at the concentration 1 CC 10 ( B); Viral growth by plaque assay on Vero cells ( C).
2: Controls are RRV-infected cells without treatment by chloroquine and the essential oils.
3: Values are expressed as mean  SEM (n = 5).
