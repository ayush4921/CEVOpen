0:  Inhibition of RRV- renLuc replication by the 3 essential oils under the experimental conditions shown in Fig 5.
1: HEK293T was exposed to RRV- renLuc at MOI 2 and treated as shown in Fig 5 with essential oils ( A) luciferase activity on HEK293T cells ( B) Viral growth by plaque assay on Vero cells.
2: Controls are RRV- renLuc-infected cells infected without treatment by the essential oils.
3: Values are expressed as relative percentage  SEM (n = 5).
4: (* p< 0.05, ** p< 0.01, *** p< 0.005). )
