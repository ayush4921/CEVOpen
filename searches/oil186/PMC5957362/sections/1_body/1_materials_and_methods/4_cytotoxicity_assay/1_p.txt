0: Cell viability was measured using the tetrazolium salt MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay [ 28].
1: Vero or HEK293T cells were seeded in 96-well plates (210 5 cells/well) and allowed to adhere overnight at 37C.
2: Cells were then treated 21 h at 37C with each essential oil within a wide range of concentrations (0.141130 g.mL -1).
3: The essential oils were solubilized in 0.4% DMSO (Sigma).
4: Following the treatment, 20 L of 5 mg.mL -1 MTT solution (Sigma, Saint-Quentin Fallavier France) were added on the 96-well plates and cells were stored at 37C in the darkness.
5: After 3 h of treatment, supernatant was removed and replaced by 100 L of DMSO.
6: Plates were then read at 570 nm on a microplate reader Tecan SunriseTM.
7: The cytotoxic concentrations are defined as the concentration of the essential oil that causes death to 50% (CC 50) or 10% (CC 10) of viable cells with respect to controls without the essential oil ( Table 1).
8: Experiments were performed in hexaplicate from five independent experiments (see  S1 Fig).
