0: Ross River virus derived from an infectious clone of strain T48 (RRV-T48), GenBank GQ433359 was generously provided by Professor Richard J. Khun, Purdue University [ 29].
1: The recombinant RRV-T48 expressing  Renilla reniformis luciferase, as an integral part of the non-structural polyprotein precursor, was obtained according to the procedure previously described for Chikungunya virus [ 30].
2: Briefly, the resulting plasmids pRRV- renLuc was linearized and the corresponding RNA was transcribed  in vitro using the kit mMESSAGE mMACHINEs Kit (Ambion) before transfection into Vero cells to provide live RRV- renLuc viruses [ 31].
3: Supernatants were collected after 48 h (first passage) and used to infect Vero cells in order to grow final virus stocks for experiments (second passage).
