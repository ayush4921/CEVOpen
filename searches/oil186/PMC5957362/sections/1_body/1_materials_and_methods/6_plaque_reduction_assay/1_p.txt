0: Virus titers were determined by plaque assays in Vero cells growing in 48-well plates as previously described [ 32].
1: Briefly, cells at confluence were incubated (0.1 mL/well) in triplicate with a serial of ten-fold dilutions of RRV- renLuc containing samples for 2 h at 37C.
2: Then, 0.1 mL of 0.8% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC, Sigma) was added.
3: After 48 h incubation at 37C, CMC was removed and the monolayers were fixed with 3.7% v/v of paraformaldehyde (10 min at room temperature).
4: Cells were then stained with 0.5% w/w crystal violet solution (10 min) and the virus titer in each well was estimated by counting the number of plaques observed.
5: The results are expressed as plaque-formation unit per milliliter (PFU.mL -1).
