0: To assess the effect of the essential oils on the replication of RRV, HEK293T cells were seeded in 96-well plates (210 5 cells/well) and allowed to adhere overnight at 37C.
1: Cells were infected with RRV- renLuc at MOI 2 in presence of the essential oil.
2: The essential oils were added at the highest non-toxic concentration (1CC 10): (i) 3 h before virus incubation (pre-treatment) and after virus incubation; (ii) during virus incubation (co-treatment) and after virus incubation; (iii) 2 h, 4 h or 6 h after virus incubation (post-treatment).
3: In all cases, the luciferase activity was measured in hexaplicate from five independent experiments by the RRV- renLuc assay.
4: Virus titers were determined from five independent experiments from harvested supernatants.
5: The end point of these two analyses was 24 h post-infection.
6: Controls consist in RRV-infected-HEK293T cells untreated with the essential oils.
7: Chloroquine at non-toxic concentration was used as positive control.
