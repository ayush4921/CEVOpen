0: The capacity of the tested essential oils on RRV-T48 inducing cytopathic effect was assessed on HEK293T cells using MTT assay as described above.
1: HEK293T were seeded in 96-well plates (210 5 cells/well) and allowed to adhere overnight at 37C.
2: Cells were infected by RRV-T48 alone at MOI 2 or by RRV-T48 at MOI 2 and addition of the essential oil at the highest non-toxic concentration (1CC 10) during 2 h at 37C.
3: After virus adsorption, supernatants were removed and cell culture medium or 1CC 10 of the essential oil was added again.
4: Cell viability was measured at different time points from incubation at 37C (6;12;18;24;30;36;42;48 or 24;32;48 h post-infection).
5: Controls consist in RRV-infected-HEK293T cells untreated with the essential oils.
6: Chloroquine at non-toxic concentration was used as positive control.
