0: Essential oils were extracted in triplicate from 2.5 kg of aerial part (PG and CC) or roots (ZV) by hydrodistillation during 3 h using a Clevenger-type apparatus.
1: Essential oils were decanted from aqueous phase, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered using Minisart filters (0.2 m).
2: Samples were then stored at 4C in darkness.
3: The chemical composition of the essential oils was quantified by gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) on  Clarus 500 gas chromatograph and identified by gas chromatography-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry on a GCGC-TOF MS LECO Pegasus 4D system [ 27].
