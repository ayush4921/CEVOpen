0: To determine the virucidal activity, each essential oil at concentrations 0.1CC 10 or 1CC 10 was mixed with the RRV-T48 strain (110 5 PFU) during 1 h at 37C.
1: The residual infectivity was titrated by plaque assay on Vero cells with a serial of ten-fold dilutions.
2: For the entry assay, Vero cells monolayers were pre-treated 3 h at 37C with the essential oils.
3: The residual infectivity of RRV-T48 strain was then titrated by plaque assay with a serial of ten-fold dilutions on the pre-treated Vero cells.
4: All the experiments were performed in triplicate from five independent experiments and controls consist in RRV-T48-infected Vero cells without treatment with the essential oils.
