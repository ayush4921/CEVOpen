0: After infection with RRV-renLuc, the luciferase reporter is released in the cytoplasm during the polyprotein processing.
1: HEK293T cells were seeded in 96well plates (210 5 cells/well) and allowed to adhere overnight at 37C.
2: Cells were infected with RRV- renLuc at MOI 2 for 48 h. At different time points (6;12;18;24;30;36;42;48 h post-infection), supernatants were removed and cells were lysed using 20 L of lysis buffer (0.4% CHAPS, 10% glycerol, 1 mmol.L -1 EGTA, Tris-HCl, Sigma).
3: 100 L of the substrate coelenterazine (Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim, France) were then added and plates were immediately read by a luminescent plate-reader FLUOstar Omega (BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany).
4: Experiments were performed in hexaplicate from five independent experiments.
