0: Management of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) related to neglected tropical diseases has become a global health public concern [ 1].
1: The discovery of novel prophylactic or therapeutic treatments against arboviruses remain a continuous goal aimed to counter emerging virus or new viral strains [ 2].
2: Ross River virus (RRV) is a small enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the alphavirus genus, family  Togarividae [ 3].
3: The RRV incubation period in humans was estimated to be from 7 to 9 days [ 4] and like the well-known Chikungunya virus that belongs to the same viral family, it typically causes fever, rash and polyarthralgia [ 5,  6].
4: RRV is endemic in Australia where it is the most common mosquito-borne pathogen with an average of 5000 cases annually [ 7,  8].
5: After the major outbreak in the Pacific area in 1979 and 1980, serological studies revealed the silent circulation of RRV in the Fiji islands [ 9] and more recently in French Polynesia [ 10,  11].
