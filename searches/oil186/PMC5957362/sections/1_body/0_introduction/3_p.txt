0: In arboviruses-related control measures, a number of essential oils are exploited as topical repellents to reduce the incidence of mosquito bites [ 25].
1: However, as yet these have not been investigated for antiviral activity at the site of infection, the skin, where they could be absorbed percutaneously.
2: Such additional benefits of skin-applied essential oils may offer a great opportunity to control the early stages of infection, even when their repelling action fails.
3: Cymbopogon citratus,  Vetiveria zizanioides (family: Poaceae) and  Pelargonium graveolens (family: Geraniaceae) are distributed worldwide and their essential oils (denoted hereafter as CC, VZ and PG, respectively), are readily available and have notable mosquito repellent properties [ 26].
4: The aim of the present study was to investigate the inhibitory effects  in vitro of these three common essential oils at non-cytotoxic concentrations against RRV.
5: We assessed their effects on both virus entry using the wild-type of RRV-T48 strain (RRV-T48) and viral replication using a recombinant RRV expressing  Renilla reniformis luciferase (RRV- renLuc).
