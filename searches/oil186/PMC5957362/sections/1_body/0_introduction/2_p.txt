0: Two biological characteristics distinguish RRV from other alphaviruses: more than 40 species of mosquitoes can act as its vectors, thus, providing a large number of potential amplification cycles, and numerous warm blood host (mainly marsupials) support this viruss replication [ 12].
1: This provides numerous opportunities for RRV to infect humans and initiate outbreak foci [ 13].
2: Indeed, during 2017, a large outbreak was observed in the South-West Region of Australia with more than 2 thousand cases reported in less than 2 months.
3: Because the infection lead to very painful and debilitating joint, up to months after the initial onset, the disease has a direct impact on health services and calls for direct responses from the Australian authorities [ 14].
4: Consequently, RRV for which no efficient treatment is available, remains a major focus of basic research, and necessitates on-going surveys by the Australian health services [ 13,  15 18].
5: Mannose binding lectin (MBL) has been proposed as an efficient therapeutic target to alleviate RRV-induced arthritis but to date only pentosan sulfate, initially approved for the treatment of cystitis in U.S., is available [ 19,  20].
6: In an  in vitro re-evaluation of 40 plants species used in Australian folk medicine, inhibition of RRV-induced cytopathic effect (2550%) was observed with the ethanolic extract of  Myoporaceae and  Pittosporaceae species [ 21].
7: Essential oils are natural complex mixtures and their antiviral properties are due to complementary and overlapping mechanisms, as assumed for herpes simplex virus (HSV), influenza virus and yellow fever virus.
8: To date, the anti-infective properties of essential oils, though of growing interest, have not been explored for RRV [ 22 24].
