0: The edible part of the almond nut is the kernel, considered an important food crop with a high nutritional and medicinal value.
1: The oldest and most extensive medical system that first recorded the health uses for almonds derives from ancient Greeks and then the Persians, and later in traditional Chinese medicine and Indian Ayurvedic medicine [ 3].
2: From medieval times to the 18th century, almond nuts were a source of substitute milk [ 4], and also it was used as thickener before starch was discovered [ 3].
3: Almond consumption has almost doubled in the last 20 years [ 5], a fact that highlights how this consumption has evolved from a convenient snack food and component of a high number of confectioneries, to an important food which is increasingly recognized as essential for maintaining and increasing human health.
4: Recent nutritional and medical studies have associated the regular consumption of almonds with a wide range of health benefits, including protection from cancer [ 6, 7], obesity [ 8, 9, 10], diabetes [ 11, 12], and heart diseases [ 13, 14, 15, 16, 17].
5: Almond kernels may be consumed in many different ways, blanched or unblanched, raw or combined, and/or mixed with other nuts.
6: They can also be transformed to produce marzipan, nougat, almond milk, and almond flour, incorporated in many pastries and ice creams.
7: Almonds may also be combined in other products and gastronomic specialties [ 18].
8: The high nutritive value of almond kernels is mainly due to their high lipid content.
9: This lipid fraction, even constituting an important source of calories, does not contribute to cholesterol formation because of their high level of unsaturated fatty acids, mainly mono-unsaturated fatty acids [ 19].
10: Although almond kernels are high in energy, humans compensate their effect with their high satiety value [ 20].
11: The absorption of energy from almond kernels is rather inefficient, having been suggested that their chronic consumption may raise resting energy expenditure [ 21].
12: Acute and longer-term almond ingestion may help in regulating body weight [ 17], modulating fluctuations of blood glucose [ 22], total low density/high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, and triglycerides [ 23].
