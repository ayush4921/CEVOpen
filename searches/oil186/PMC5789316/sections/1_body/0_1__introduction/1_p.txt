0: Almond is the most important tree nut crop in terms of commercial production [ 1].
1: An adaptation to harsh climates combined with an ability to develop a deep and extensive root system has allowed almond to exploit a wide range of ecological niches.
2: Almond is well-adapted to the Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild winters and dry, hot summers.
3: This adaptation has led to early bloom and rapid early shoot growth because of the low chilling requirements of almond.
4: Almond also shows high tolerance to summer drought and heat.
5: Almond has traditionally been the earliest temperate fruit tree crop to bloom, which limited growing to areas relatively free from spring frosts before the release of late-blooming cultivars by different breeding programs, since frosts at bloom or early fruit development can reduce, and even completely nullify, the crop.
6: Since almond is naturally self-incompatible, it often requires cross-pollination, which further acts to promote genetic variability and adaptability to diverse environments [ 2].
