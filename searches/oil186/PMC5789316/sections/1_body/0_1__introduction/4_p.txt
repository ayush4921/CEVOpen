0: Early reviews on the composition of the almond nuts [ 18, 26] did not include tocopherols as an important component of almond kernels.
1: More recently tocopherols were already included in several reviews [ 27, 28], but most of them were primarily descriptive without attempts to assess quality, particularly as it relates not only to industrial requirements, but also to breeding goals and approaches.
2: Extensive variability in the chemical composition has been demonstrated among cultivars; additionally the importance of differences in geographical origins, as well as climatic and growing conditions have also been demonstrated.
3: Despite this extensive information, little is known concerning the genetic control and inheritance of biochemical components of almond quality.
4: For all these reasons, this review summarizes the current knowledge of the almond kernel tocopherol composition and factors affecting its variability.
