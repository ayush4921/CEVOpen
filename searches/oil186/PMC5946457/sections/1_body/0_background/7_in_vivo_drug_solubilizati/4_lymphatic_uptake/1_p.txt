0: As demonstrated in Fig.
1: 2, a fraction of particulate drug, encapsulated by triglycerides is restructured in the endoplasmic reticulum and then released into the mesenteric lymph duct as chylomicrons [ 66].
2: Thereafter it reaches the systemic circulation via thoracic lymph [ 67 69].
3: Lymphatic uptake becomes ever effective since the drug molecules are bypassed.
4: But, the chain length of triglycerides and solubility of the drug in oil determines the outcome of lymphatic uptake of orally administered lipophilic moieties.
