0: Being submicron sized systems, ME/NEs exhibit prolonged circulation [ 70].
1: A major portion of orally administered ME/NEs undergo intestinal lymphatic absorption followed by biodistribution and finally ended up with lymphatic drainage to capillaries.
2: An extent of the biodistributed drug is affected by the macrophages of liver, spleen, and lungs with the result of RES uptake [ 71].
3: HCO-60, a pharmaceutically modified castor oil in conjugated linoleic acid microemulsion was effective as co-surfactant against RES uptake [ 72].
4: Combination of carriers such as capmul and myvacet oil used thereof in particulate systems accounts largely for biodistribution of emulsified systems [ 73,  74].
5: A potential intestinal P-gp inhibitor tween 80 was also reported to produce higher indinavir distribution levels in plasma.
6: However, highly hydrophilic drug undergo rapid uptake by organs of the reticulo-endothelial system (RES) lead to lowering of drug levels [ 75].
