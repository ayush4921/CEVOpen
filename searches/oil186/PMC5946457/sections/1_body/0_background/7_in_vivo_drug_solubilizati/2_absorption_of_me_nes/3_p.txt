0: ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and solute carriers are notable intestinal transporters which regulate the transport of molecules into and out of enterocytes.
1: Cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4), multidrug efflux pump and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) are present high levels at villus tip enterocytes of the small intestine.
2: P-gp is ABC transporter and highly expressed on the brush-border membrane of columnar epithelial cells.
3: The efflux transport of particulate emulsified systems into enterocytes is affected by these local transporters.
4: However, efflux inhibition is anticipated with membrane fluidization, induced conformational changes and cholesterol depletion [ 54].
5: PEG 400, Cremophor EL, RH40 and combinatorial surfactants are successful in inhibiting P-gp by forming the micelles during emulsification which can masquerade drug thereby not exposing core drug molecules to the efflux transporters [ 55 60].
