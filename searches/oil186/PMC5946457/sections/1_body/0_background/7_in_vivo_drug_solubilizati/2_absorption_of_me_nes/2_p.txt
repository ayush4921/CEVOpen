0: A pH-stat automatic titration unit model demonstrated the lipolysis of ME/NEs and subsequent phases which alters the release profile and fate of a drug in GIT.
1: The further extent of digestion affects release profiles of the drug located in the core of ME/NEs rather than shell [ 18,  48].
2: Carriers of ME/NEs transport the drug present in oil core to mucus layer while the drug available in surfactant shell get separate out as free molecules from carriers and diffuse directly to the epithelium.
3: Though lipophilic compounds readily diffuse across the apical plasma membrane of intestinal epithelium the subsequent passage across the basolateral membrane and into blood are by no means guaranteed [ 49].
4: Thus, ME/NEs facilitate improved transport across the intestinal wall and lead to lowering the effect of protease, an intestinal enzyme and sustained plasma uptake [ 50,  51], this attribute was proven to be successful with the sustained release of rhPTH134, a peptide drug by opening tight junctions [ 52,  53].
