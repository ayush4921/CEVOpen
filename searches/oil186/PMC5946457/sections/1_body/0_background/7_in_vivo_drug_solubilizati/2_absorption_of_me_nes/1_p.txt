0: Mostly, absorption of ME/NEs is high in small intestinal lumen rather than in other parts of GIT since it contains biliary lipids (bile salts, phospholipids, and cholesterol).
1: MCTs with amphiphilic nature present in particulate emulsified systems undergo lipolysis at lumen of the intestine into free fatty acids and monoglycerides.
2: These products have the ability to coalesce readily with bile lipids and form micelles.
3: Further, fatty acids of 1012 carbon atoms and drugs with lop  P < 5 passively diffused from the lumen into the systemic circulation by enterocytes [ 38 41].
4: Fatty acids of more than 1012 carbon atoms and drugs with log  P > 5 are re-esterified to triglycerides in enterocytes as represented in Fig.
5: 1.
6: Cholesterol also undergoes esterification by luminal enzymes into cholesterol esters.
7: The formed triglycerides and cholesterol esters are then covered by a layer of proteins and phospholipids to form chylomicrons, which leaves the cell through exocytosis and enter the lymphatics owing to apparent molar volume increase.
8: Therefore, drugs undergo either portal or lymphatic absorption depending on molecular features and diffusion coefficient of API [ 42 47].
