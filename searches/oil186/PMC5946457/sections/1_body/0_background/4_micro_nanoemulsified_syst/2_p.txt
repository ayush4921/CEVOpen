0: Micro/nanoemulsions (ME/NEs) share the similarities in definition, as they are isotropic, homogenous liquid systems composed of oil, amphiphile and water contents, very often included with a modifier like cosurfactant or cosolvent [ 9] to constitute stability.
1: Unfortunately, these emulsified lipid systems are used as misnomers on several occasions but they differ majorly in terms of droplet size.
2: Nanoemulsions as dispersed oil droplets with 10100 nm radii are thermodynamically non-equilibrium and kinetically stable systems [ 10].
3: Microemulsion composed of high amphiphile concentration (> 20%) offers thermodynamic stability.
4: The relative size of ME/NEs droplets accounts for their optical transparency, translucence, and stability [ 11].
5: Owing to sub-micron droplet size, the solubility of lipophilic drugs is enhanced and fortified with intra-luminal processing [ 12].
6: The release of encapsulated functional components from ME/NEs is potentiated by trigger mechanisms such as pH, ionic strength, temperature and presence of enzymes.
7: It is characterized in terms of increase in concentration in the continuous phase or target location such as the mouth, nose, stomach, or gastrointestinal tract with the function of time [ 11].
