0: ME/NEs including SMEDDS and SNEDDS are strategically significant due to the protection of lipophilic drugs against degradation in GIT, translocation across epithelial barriers by extending transit time and specified absorptive pathways.
1: Performance of ME/NEs is typically depended on the class/type of system and composition [ 13].
