0: Oils as carriers firstly meant for hydrophobic drugs to sink, long, medium and short chain triglycerides (LCT, MCT, and SCT) were predominantly used in the preparation of ME/NEs with the rank order of MCTs>LCTs>SCTs [ 1].
1: Type of oil used in the formulation has a great impact on solubilization, digestion of carrier lipid and drug release with desired characteristics.
2: Principally, LCTs and MCTs are converted into free fatty acids by water dispersion during digestion.
3: Free fatty acids of MCTs are able to migrate rapidly into surrounding medium whereas those produced by LCTs accumulate at the oil-water interface thereby lipase activity is inhibited [ 1,  11] Semisynthetic MCTs are superior over natural MCTs as it was proven in Naringenin nanoemulsions [ 3,  14].
4: Combination of LCTs and MCTs was also promised with superior emulsifying and dissolution profiles [ 15].
5: The success of MEs/NEs is affected by molecular and lipid characters of MCT and LCTs such as loading of drug and droplet size, chemical nature, and stability [ 16,  17].
6: As absorption of ME/NEs is governed by Ostwald ripening principle, significant portal absorption of crodomol GTCC, an MCT and lymphatic absorption of corn and canola oils (LCT) were resulted [ 1,  18].
