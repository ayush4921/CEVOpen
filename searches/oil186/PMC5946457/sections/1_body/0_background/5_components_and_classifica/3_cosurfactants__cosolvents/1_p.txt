0: Short-to-medium-chain (C3-C8) alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, carbitol, PEGs, glycerin, propylene glycol, etc.
1: have the potential to increase the emulsification efficiency by reducing the bending stress at an interface and allow film flexibility to different curvatures for the formation of ME/NEs.
2: They primarily increase the mobility of hydrocarbon tail and allow greater penetration of oil at the interface [ 25,  26].
3: Transcutol, a cosurfactant has efficiently increased the solubility of paracetamol as a function of temperature over other cosolvents and also combinations [ 27].
