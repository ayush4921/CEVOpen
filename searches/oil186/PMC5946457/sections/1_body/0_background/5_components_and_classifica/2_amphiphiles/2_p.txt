0: Being nonionic, polysorbate is less toxic and unaffected by changes in pH, ionic strength and promotes the formation of ultrafine droplets [ 20] whereas, poloxamers display aggregation with Ostwald ripening.
1: But in combination with ionic surfactants, due aggregation of poloxamers is minimized by imparting a positive charge on the surface.
2: A similar principle was noticed in a binary mixture of DDAB and C12E5 DDAB (cationic nonionic) surfactants which had no obvious effect on droplet structure and size, although it improved the stability of nanoemulsion [ 21].
3: Hence, the nonionic surfactants are considered to be stable in the design of ME/NEs and their subtypes [ 3].
4: Tween 80, cremophor EL and cremophor RH40 had proven their superiority on digestion and increased absorption by inhibiting the efflux transporters such as p-gp, breast cancer resistance protein and MDR-protein [ 4,  22,  23].
5: A recent success of amphiphiles was portrayed with a combination of Gelucire, sucrose ester, a non-digestable surfactant.
6: The substitution of the non-digestible surfactants with digestible surfactants, sucrose esters S-1670 and Span 60, eliminated the digestion lag time with no change in the formation of colloidal structures [ 24].
