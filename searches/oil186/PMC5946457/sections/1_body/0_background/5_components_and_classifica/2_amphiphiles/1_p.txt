0: Due to typical structural significance, amphiphiles reduce the interfacial tension and impart thermodynamic stability in dispersions.
1: Droplet size of hetero-dispersions is affected by HLB value, type, and concentration of surfactant [ 3].
2: Surfactants with high HLB (1218) are suitable candidates for ME/NEs [ 19], since their ability to form smaller droplets within the GI lumen that enables the absorption maxima.
3: In contrast, at higher concentrations, surfactants hamper the absorption process due to increased apparent weight on whole [ 1].
