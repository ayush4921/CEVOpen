0: Mucins, long (2001000 nm) heterogenous polydispersed filaments of glycosylated proteins are protecting GI mucosa from pH fluctuations, pathogens, mechanical irritation and toxins [ 28,  29].
1: They are categorized into membrane-bound and secretory mucins [ 30].
2: Majority of mucins are linked with proline, rich in serine and /or threonine glycosylation sites repeated in tandem (named as tandem repeats).
3: These repeated units are widely varied between mucin types in terms of length (5375 amino acids) and in number (5395 repeats) [ 31].
4: Each epithelial mucin gene discovered was named as MUC in 1990.
5: Currently, in humans, 20 mucin-type glycoproteins have been assigned to the MUC gene family, as approved by the Human Genome Organization- Gene Nomenclature Committee (HUGO/GNC).
6: MUC1, MUC3A, MUC3B, MUC4, MUC12, MUC13, MUC15, MUC16, MUC17, MUC18, and MUC20 mucins have trans-membrane domains in their C-terminus and thus are type 1 membrane proteins [ 32].
7: Stomach epithelia contain MUC1, which is present on the apical membranes of parietal cells in fundic glands [ 33].
8: MUC2 contains four conserved cysteine-rich domains that have sequence similarity to the D-domains of pro-von Willebrand clotting factor expressed in goblet cells of the intestine [ 34,  35].
9: The other large gel-forming cysteine-rich secretory mucins are MUC5AC, MUC5B, MUC6, and MUC19 [ 36].
10: The MUC 3 gene was essentially expressed in the epithelial cells of small intestine especially in goblet cells and in enterocytes [ 37].
11: Majorly, MUC 5 AC and MUC 6 gene are expressed in gastric tracts.
12: Mucins affect the absorption of ME/NEs in terms of their biochemical composition, viscosity, diffusivity, dipole moment, zwitterion profiles, ionic strength and interaction with the dispersion medium.
13: Overall, ME/NEs undergo absorption at various sites of GIT such as gastric lumen, stomach, and small intestine as their biomembrane diffusion is proportional to the reciprocal of mucin concentration [ 36].
