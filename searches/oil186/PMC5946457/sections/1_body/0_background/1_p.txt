0: With the advent of several emerging novel chemical entities, delivery of high molecular weight and poorly soluble bioactive molecules remains a challenging task.
1: Therapeutic efficacy of low soluble molecules (BCS Class II and IV) is generally high and hence the design of oral delivery systems with improved dissolution and permeability characteristics cannot be ignored [ 1] However, poor solubility characters pose greater inter/intra subject variabilities and dose disproportionalities.
2: Yet, most of the novel strategies still remain open for developing versatile oral drug delivery systems since the route of administration is salient [ 2,  3].
3: However, development of stable and acceptable dosage forms for lipophilic drugs is an ever challenging task for the researchers.
