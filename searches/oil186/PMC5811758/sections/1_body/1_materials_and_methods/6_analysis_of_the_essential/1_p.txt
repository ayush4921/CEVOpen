0: Oil sample analysis was achieved on an Hp-6890 gas chromatograph equipped with an FID and a DB-5 capillary column, 30 m  0.25 mm, 0.25 m film thickness, temperature was programmed as follows: 60 C 240 C at 4 C/ min.
1: The carrier gas was N 2 at a flow of 2.0 ml/min; injector port and detector temperature were 250 C and 300 C, respectively.
2: The sample was injected by splitting and the split ratio was 1:10.
