0: GC/MS analysis was done on a Hewlett-Packard 6890 /5972 system with a DB-5 capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm; 0.25 m film thickness).
1: The operating conditions were the same conditions as described above but the carrier gas was He.
2: Mass spectra were taken at 70 eV.
3: Scan mass range was from 40400 m/z at a sampling rate of 1.0 scan/s.
4: Quantitative data were obtained from the electronic integration of the FID peak areas.
5: The components of the oil were known by their retention time, retention indices, relative to C 9-C 28 n-alkanes, computer matching with the WILEY275.L library, as well as by comparison of their mass spectra with data already available in the literature ( 10).
6: The percentage of composition of the identified compounds was computed from the GC peaks areas without any correction factors and was calculated relatively.
