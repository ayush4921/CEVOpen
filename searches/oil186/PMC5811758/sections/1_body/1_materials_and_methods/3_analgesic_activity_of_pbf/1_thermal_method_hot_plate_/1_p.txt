0: The hot-plate procedure was employed for the purpose of preferential assessment of the possible centrally mediated analgesic effect of PBFEO ( 5).
1: Animals were individually placed on a controlled hot-plate maintained at 550.2 C. Briefly, the animals were placed on the hot-plate apparatus and latency to licking or shaking of the paws or jumping was recorded.
2: PBFEO (50, 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg, IP) was given to the separate group by intraperitoneal injection.
3: Morphine (5 mg/kg) and vehicle (sweet almond oil, 10 ml/kg) were also administered by the same route.
4: The latency was recorded before and 15, 30, 45, and 60 min following intraperitoneal administration of the agents and is expressed as the percentage of maximal possible effect (MPE).
5: MPE% = 100%   (postdrug latency   predrug latency)  (cutoff   predrug latency).
6: A 15 sec cutoff time was used to prevent tissue damage.
