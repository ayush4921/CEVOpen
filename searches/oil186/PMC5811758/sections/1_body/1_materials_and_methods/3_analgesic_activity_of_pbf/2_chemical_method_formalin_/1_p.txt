0: The analgesic effects of PBFEO were investigated by formalin test.
1: 30 min after separate injection of different doses of the essential oil (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg), morphine (5 mg/kg, positive control) and the vehicle, formalin (50 l of 2.5%) was injected into the hind paw of the mice.
2: Scoring of nociceptive behaviors began after formalin injection and was continued for 60 min.
3: A nociceptive score was recorded for each five-minute time block by measuring the amount of time spent in each of the following behavioral types: 3, the injected paw was licked, bitten, or shaken; 2, the injected paw was elevated; 1, the injected paw had little or no weight placed on it; and 0, the injected paw was not favored.
4: Pain rating ranging from zero to three, was calculated ( 6).
5: Individual time course determinations in the formalin test were changed to area-under-the-curve values, zero to ten min after formalin injection (AUC phase ?)
6: and 1060 min after formalin injection (AUC phase ??)
7: ( 6).
