0: Efficient control of these diseases would require a two-pronged strategy, (i) prompt treatment with effective medicines and (ii) vector control based prevention strategies.
1: Injudicious use of medicines, particularly antimalarial drugs, has resulted in development of resistance by the malarial parasite and enhanced casualties in endemic areas ( Intirach et al.
2: 2012).
3: Mosquito management therefore, offers a better and practical alternative for controlling diseases mediated by them.
4: Mosquito adulticides, causing temporary reduction in population are good but do not offer a lasting solution.
5: Mosquito larvae being delicate, less mobile and more concentrated in their natural habitat offer a much simpler and efficient point of intervention and control ( Rutledge et al.
6: 2003,  Dharmagadda et al.
7: 2005).
8: However, there are reports of development of resistance and behavior changes in adult mosquitoes and larvae towards these chemicals ( Mittal et al.
9: 2004,  WHO 2006).
10: Moreover, they adversely affect the environment, causing soil, air, water pollution and harm the beneficial non target organisms ( Dharmagadda et al.
11: 2005).
12: Plant extract including essential oils or insecticides from botanical origin are attractive alternatives because they contain high amount of various bioactive compounds, many of which are selective and have little or no harmful effects on non-target organisms and environment ( Rutledge et al.
13: 2003,  Dharmagadda et al.
14: 2005).
15: Essential oil is natural volatile substances found in many plants.
16: Essential oils isolated from plant are generally a mixture of many constituents, primarily biologically active monoterpenes ( Govindrajan 2010).
17: Traditionally, they have been used for flavor enhancement in food, odorants in fragrances, pharmaceuticals and confectionary industries ( Zhu et al.
18: 2001).
19: Of late, they have received considerable attention as potentially active, human and environment friendly bio insecticides ( Cheng et al.
20: 2003).
21: There are several reports on larvicidal activity of essential oil from neem, basil, citronella, lemon, eucalyptus, pine etc ( Cheng et al.
22: 2003,  Amer and Mehlhorn 2006,  Dua et al.
23: 2009).
24: The resistance against plant derived insecticides has not been reported so far ( Kannathasan et al.
25: 2011).
