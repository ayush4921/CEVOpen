0: For the evaluation of the inhibition effect of the  C. citratus essential oil upon the germination of conidia there was used an entirely casualized design, with seven treatments and three repetitions.
1: The treatments were constituted by the following oil concentrations: 0.625; 1.25; 2.5; 5.0, and 7.5 L mL 1, negative control, with methyl-thiophanate (2 mg mL 1) and positive control with distilled/sterilized water.
2: From each oil treatment, there was mixed 100 L of the oil concentrations and 100 L of the  C. lunata conidia concentration (10 4 conidia mL 1).
3: The evaluation was made 12 h after the inoculation in optical microscope.
