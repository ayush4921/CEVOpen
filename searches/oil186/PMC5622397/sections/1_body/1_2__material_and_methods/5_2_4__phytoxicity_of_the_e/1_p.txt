0: The phytoxicity test was realized in greenhouse conditions.
1: There were utilized six polyethylene vases filled with half commercial substrate and half soil.
2: There was added 10 g of fertilizer NPK (5-25-15) in each vase.
3: On the maize plantation there were utilized Traktor (Syngenta ) seeds, sowing two for each hole.
4: After sowing, the vases were irrigated daily until the seedlings growth reached four definitive leaves, or 15 days after plantation.
5: Manual sprayers were used for the application of the treatments.
6: There was utilized an entirely casualized design with six treatments and three repetitions, where different concentrations of the  C. citratus oil were tested, being: 2.5 L mL 1, 5 L mL 1, 7.5 L mL 1, 10 L mL 1, 50 L mL 1.
7: The positive control was prepared utilizing only distilled water with the same volume utilized for the concentrations of the oil.
8: Each vase was pulverized with 5 mL of the solutions.
9: The evaluation was made according to the phytotoxicity scale adapted from [ 12] until the tenth day.
