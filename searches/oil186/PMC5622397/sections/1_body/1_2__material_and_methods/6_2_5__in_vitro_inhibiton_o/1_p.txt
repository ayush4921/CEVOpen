0: Aiming at verifying the effect of essential oil upon the mycelial growth of the phytopatogen, there was different concentrations of  C. citratus oil were tested, being: 2.5 L mL 1, 5 L mL 1, 7.5 L mL 1, 10 L mL 1 and 50 L mL 1.
1: As negative and positive control there were prepared the solutions of methyl-thiophanate (2 mg mL 1) (one for  C. lunata and the other for  Fusarium sp.)
2: and sterilized distilled water, respectively.
3: There was tested another pathogen in order to verify the efficiency of the proposed fungicide.
4: There was utilized 100 L from each concentration, distributed on the surface of the culture environment with the aid of a Drigalski spatula.
5: Next, a mycelium-agar disk with 6 mm diameter was put into the center of the plates.
6: The plates were sealed with PVC (Polyvinyl chloride) film, identified and incubated in BOD at 25 C for 10 days.
7: The evaluations were realized with digital caliper assessing the mycelial diameter of the fungus tracing two orthogonal axes with each other upon the center of the plates resulting in a arithmetic mean and measured every two days (2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 days).
