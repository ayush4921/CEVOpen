0: For the preparation of the essential oil solutions sterilized small glass jars with lids were utilized in order to receive the different concentrations.
1: One supply solution was prepared for the higher concentration utilizing a volumetric flask of 10 mL.
2: On sequence, there was added initially the oil and adjusted the concentration of 50 L mL 1 to a volume of 10 mL, next there was added Tween 80 (1 oil: 1 Tween).
3: In laminar flow chamber, the flask was softly agitated and next was inserted the distilled water.
4: After the agitation, there was obtained a homogeneous mixture.
5: Subsequently, there were realized the other dilutions until the concentrations of 2.5 L mL 1, 5 L mL 1 and 7.5 L mL 1 were obtained.
6: As negative and positive control there were prepared the solutions of methyl-thiophanate (2 mg mL 1) and sterilized distilled water, respectively.
