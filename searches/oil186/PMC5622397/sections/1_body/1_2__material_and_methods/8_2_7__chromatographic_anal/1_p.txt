0: The qualitative and quantitative analyses of the essential oils were realized by chromatography in gas phase, attached to the mass spectrometry CG-MS.
1: The chromatograph utilized was the model Shimadzu GC-210, equipped with mass selective detector model QP2010 Plus, and was operated in these conditions: capillary column of fused silica TRX-5MS (30 m  0.25 mm  0.25 m of film thickness); with the following programming of the temperature on the column: 60240 C (3 C min 1); injector temperature: 220 C; carrier gas helium; and, splitless injection with injected volume of 1 L of a solution 1:1000 in hexane.
2: For the mass spectrometer (MS), there were utilized the following conditions: impact energy of 70 eV; ion source, and interface temperature: 200 C. There was injected, at the sample conditions, a homologous series of n-alkanes (C 9H 20... C 26H 54).
3: The obtained specters were compared with the Nist and Wiley 229 Librarys database and the retention rate calculated to each component was compared to the tabulated, according to [ 15].
4: The quantification of essential oils compounds levels were obtained with a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FIT) using a Shimadzu GC-210 device, in the following methodology: capillary column RTX-5MS (30 m  0.25 mm  0.25 m of film thickness); injector temperature: 220 C; FIT temperature: 300 C; with column programming: initial temperature of 60 C with a heating rate of 3 C min 1 until 240 C, next, passing to a heating rate of 10 C min 1 until 300 C, remaining on this temperature for 10 min; drag gas nitrogen (1.18 mL min 1); split rate 1:50; column pressure of 115 KPa, and injected volume of 1 L in hexane.
