0: For evaluating the curative effect of the essential oil, an entirely casualized design was used, where different concentrations of the  C. citratus oil were tested, being: 0.625; 1.25; 2.5; 5.0; and 7.5 L mL 1, and three repetitions.
1: As a control, there were utilized water-pulverized plants (positive control) and methyl-thiophanate-pulverized plants at 2 mg mL 1 (negative control).
2: The maize plants were inoculated with 5 mL of the conidia solution (10 4 conidia mL 1) of  C. lunata, and next the vases were kept for 48 h with humid cotton and closed with plastic bag in order to provide a humid chamber.
3: 48 h after the inoculation, the plants were left in shaded place until the appearance of the first leaf symptoms of  Curvularia Leaf Spot.
4: From each treatment, 5 mL of the already cited oil concentrations was sprayed on the plants after verification of the appearance of the disease, and the evaluation of severity of the disease was made every two days, being realized a total of five evaluations after the application of the oil solutions.
5: With the obtained results in the evaluations, the Area Under Disease Progress Curve (AUDPC) was calculated, according to [ 17].
