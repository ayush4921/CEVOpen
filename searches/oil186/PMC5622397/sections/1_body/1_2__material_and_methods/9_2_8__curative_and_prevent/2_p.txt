0: In order to evaluate the preventive effect of the essential oil, an entirely casualized design was used, where different concentrations of the  C. citratus oil were tested, being: 0.625; 1.25; 2.5; 5.0; and 7.5 mg mL 1, and three repetitions.
1: As control, there were utilized water-pulverized plants (positive control) and methyl-thiophanate-pulverized plants at 2 mg mL 1 (negative control).
2: From each treatment, 5 mL was sprayed on the plants and one hour after, the plants were inoculated with 5 mL of the conidia solution (10 4 conidia mL 1) of  C. lunata.
3: The evaluation of the severity of the disease was made every two days after inoculation (5 evaluations on total).
