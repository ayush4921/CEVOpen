0:  Representive TGF- 1 immunohistochemistry in liver tissue of the different experimental groups (200).
1: (a and d) The normal control (group 1) and MPEO control (group 4) showing weak immunopositive reaction in portal areas.
2: (b) Liver fibrosis control (group 2) showing intense immunostaining in periductal cells in the portal tract, in perisinusoidal cells, around the blood vessels, and in sinusoidal lining cells.
3: (c) MPEO-treated (group 3) showing mild reaction in some perisinusoidal cells.
4: (e) Bar chart represents the TGF- 1 immunohistochemistry in liver expressed as area %.
