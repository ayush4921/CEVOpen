0:  Representative -SMA immunohistochemistry in liver tissues of the different experimental groups (200).
1: (a and d) The normal control (group 1) and MPEO control (group 4) showing -SMA staining in the smooth muscle cells of the hepatic vessels.
2: (b) Liver fibrosis control (group 2) showing strong immunostaining reaction in myofibroblast cells.
3: (c) MPEO-treated (group 3) showing marked reduction in immunopositive reactive areas.
4: (e) Bar chart represents the -SMA immunohistochemistry expressed as area %.
