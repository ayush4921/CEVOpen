0: Liver fibrosis and cirrhosis are the ultimate consequences of chronic hepatic injury induced by various etiological agents [ 1].
1: The mechanism of liver fibrosis has been extensively studied.
2: However, effective antifibrotic therapies are lacking [ 2].
3: The pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis is generally based on the activation of HSCs and excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) production [ 2].
4: Oxidative stress plays a central role in triggering these inflammatory and fibrotic responses [ 3].
5: Among the various signaling pathways involved in pathogenesis of liver fibrosis, TGF- 1/SMAD is considered the most significant signaling pathway [ 4].
6: Therefore, inhibiting TGF- 1 was found to be efficient in attenuating liver fibrosis [ 5,  6].
7: The tumor suppressor p53 is another important cell signal primarily stimulated in response to oxidative damage and oncogene activation [ 7].
8: Accumulating evidences suggested the involvement of p53 in the pathophysiology of various nontumoral fibrotic liver diseases in both human and animals [ 8,  9].
9: These data suggest that p53 regulation could serve as an important therapeutic target for fibrotic liver diseases.
