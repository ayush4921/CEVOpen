0: Medicinal plants and their derivatives contain a wide variety of bioactive phytochemicals with a diverse pharmacological spectrum [ 10,  11].
1: Essential oils constituents including terpenes, terpenoids, phenylpropenes, and other degradation products have been reported to exhibit strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities [ 12].
2: The effectiveness of some essential oils to alleviate the hepatotoxicity [ 13] and hepatic fibrosis [ 14] has been proven.
3: Mentha piperita L. (peppermint) is one of the most popular and widely used herbs.
4: Pharmacological investigations have demonstrated that  M. piperita possesses analgesic, antifungal [ 15], antibacterial [ 16], antiparasitic, and immunomodulatory activities [ 17].
5: Moreover, the hepatoprotective effects of  M. piperita leaves extract [ 18], oil [ 19,  20], or its active components menthol and menthone [ 21] have been reported.
6: However, to the best of our knowledge, the effect against hepatic fibrosis has not been reported.
7: Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of  Mentha piperita L. essential oil (MPEO) against hepatic fibrosis and to elucidate the potential underlying molecular mechanisms.
