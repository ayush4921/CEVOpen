0: Seven liver samples were harvested from each experimental group and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and then processed to obtain 4  m paraffin-embedded sections.
1: The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson's trichrome (MT).
2: MT staining was performed to assess collagen fibers distribution and to determine liver fibrosis %.
3: A numerical scoring system [ 29] was performed to assess the grade of fibrosis, as follows: 0, no fibrosis (normal); 1, fibrous expansion of some portal areas; 2, fibrous expansion of most portal areas; 3, fibrous expansion of most portal areas with occasional portal-to-portal bridging; 4, fibrous expansion of portal areas with marked bridging (portal to portal as well as portal to central); 5, marked bridging (portal to central as well as central to central) with occasional nodules formation; and 6, cirrhosis.
