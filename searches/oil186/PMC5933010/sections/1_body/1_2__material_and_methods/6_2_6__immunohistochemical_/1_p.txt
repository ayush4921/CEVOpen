0: The immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses were done according to the methods of Ogaly et al.
1: [ 14].
2: Briefly, tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated.
3: The antigen retrieval was performed by pretreating the tissue sections for 20 min with citrate buffer pH 6 at microwave oven.
4: Sections were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody to  -SMA diluted 1 : 200 (ab5694; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), rabbit polyclonal antidesmin antibody diluted 1 : 200 (ab15200; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), rabbit polyclonal anti-TGF- 1 antibody with concentration of 20  g/mL (ab92486; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), rabbit polyclonal anti-SMAD3 antibody diluted 1 : 100 (ab28379; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and rabbit polyclonal anti-Tp53 antibody diluted 1 : 100 (ab131442; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for two hours in a humidified chamber.
5: The tissue sections were incubated with goat antirabbit IgG H&L (HRP) (ab205718; Abcam, Cambridge, UK).
6: Finally, the slides were incubated for 10 min with 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB; Sigma) as chromagen, counterstained with hematoxylin, and mounted with DPX.
7: The image analyses of the stained sections were performed by Leica Qwin 500 Image Analyzer (Leica, Cambridge, England).
8: In each group, seven sections were examined.
9: The percentage of the immunopositive area (%) was calculated as mean of 10 fields/section.
