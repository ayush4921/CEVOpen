0: Total RNA isolated from liver tissues using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) was reverse transcribed and subjected to quantitative real-time RT-PCR as previously described [ 14].
1: mRNA expression levels of Tp53 and CYP2E1 genes were assessed using GAPDH gene as the reference gene.
2: Briefly, cDNA was added to a Quantifast SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Qiagen) containing 30 pg/mL of each primer ( Table 1).
3: The thermal program included 40 cycles of denaturation at 95C for 15 s, annealing at 60C for 15 s, and extension at 72C for 45 s. The first denaturation was extended to 1 min.
4: Calculation of gene expression was done following Livak and Schmittgen [ 30].
