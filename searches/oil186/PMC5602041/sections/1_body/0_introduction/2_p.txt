0: The common tick,  Ixodes ricinus (L.) (Acari: Ixodidae), is a triphasic tick that parasitizes a large number of vertebrates including small, medium to large mammals; birds and lizards (Becker et al.
1: 2009).
2: The abundance of  I.  ricinus on different vegetation types in a wooded area of Southern Italy was determined by Dantas-Torres and Otranto ( 2013).
3: They found that the abundance of  I.  ricinus larvae on the ground-level vegetation was generally higher than on the higher vegetation whereas both nymphs and adult stages were more abundant on higher vegetation.
4: The questing behavior of  I.  ricinus consists of climbing the low vegetation to a point from where it can attach to the passing hosts.
5: The host-seeking activity of the castor-bean tick indicated that this tick has a bimodal seasonal activity with a dominant peak during spring whereas a minor peak during autumn (Schulz et al.
6: 2014).
7: The immature stages (larvae and nymphs) feed on woodland birds and small to medium-sized mammals while the adult female feeds on large mammals.
8: Each life stage (larva, nymph, adult) of this tick feeds once on different host for continuous period lasting several days (Heylen et al.
9: 2013).
