0: Ixodesricinus is a potential vector of different pathogens.
1: The cattle parasite,  Babesia divergens (the causative agent of humans babesiosis) is transmitted to human by  I.  ricinus (Zintl et al.
2: 2014).
3: Spirochete,  Borreliaburgdorferi sensu lato (the causative agent of Lyme disease) is considered diderm (double-membrane) bacteria with a worldwide distribution.
4: Borrelia burgdorferi is mostly associated with  I.  ricinus complex in Northern Hemisphere.
5: The density of questing  I. ricinus in Northern Norway was determined for the first time by Hvidstena et al.
6: ( 2015).
7: They found that the overall prevalence of nymphs and adult ticks infected by  B. burgdorferi s.l.
8: was 21 and 46%, respectively.
9: The high incidence rate of reported Lyme borreliosis in Bonnoy region can be explained by the high  Borrelia-infection prevalence in ticks (Hvidstena et al.
10: 2015).
11: The encephalitis virus is transmitted to humans by  I.  ricinus nymphs and adults.
12: The infection prevalence of tick-born-encephalitis virus (TBE) was significantly lower in  I.  ricinus nymphs (0.51%) than adults (4.48%) stage (Pettersson et al.
13: 2014).
14: Due to the role of  I.  ricinus tick in the transmitting of many serous pathogens, personal protection against bites of the infected stages of  I.  ricinus is essential.
