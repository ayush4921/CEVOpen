0: Despite recent advances in tick control strategies, large-scale reduction of tick populations has not been achieved (Tabanca et al.
1: 2013).
2: The synthetic repellents are commonly accepted means of personal protection against tick bites (Iori et al.
3: 2005).
4: However, the use of such commercial synthetic acaricides leads to resistance, residual effects and potentially can harm the environment (Elmhalli et al.
5: 2009).
6: There is a direct need to establish alternative substances for tick control which are safer, available, cheaper and more effective (Frances and Wirtz  2005).
7: Many essential oils (extracted from medicinal plants) considered as promising repellent agents against  I.  ricinus.
8: The repellency of the oils appears to be largely associated with the presence of volatile terpenoid constituents.
