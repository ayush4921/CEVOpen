0: Separation and identification of volatiles from essential oils were carried out by GCMS using a Varian 3400 GC connected to a Finnigan SSQ 7000 quadrupole mass spectrometer.
1: 1 l aliquot containing 3 g/l of essential oil was injected to GC injector for analysis.
2: The GC was equipped with a split/split less injector (split less mode, 30 s; injector temperature, 230 C; carrier gas, Helium with a constant pressure of 10 psi).
3: A DB-WAX capillary column (30 m, 0.25 mm ID, and 0.25 m film thickness, J & W USA) was used.
4: The temperature program was: 40 C for 1 min then increased with a rate of 4 C/min up till 235 C and held at 235 C for 10 min.
5: Transfer line connecting GC to the MS was isothermally set to 240 C throughout the analysis.
6: The temperature of MS ion source was 150 C and mass spectra were obtained at 70 eV with a mass range of 30400  m/z.
7: Mass spectra of separated compounds were compared to the Finnigan NIST-2008 (National Institute of Standard and Technology) MS library and to available reference compounds (El-Seedi et al.
8: 2008,  2010).
