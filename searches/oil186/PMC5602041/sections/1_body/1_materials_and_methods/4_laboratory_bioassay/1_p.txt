0: To ascertain the repellent activity of the essential oils (EO) (at a concentration of 1 mg/ml) extracted from plants (Table  2) against  I.  ricinus nymphs, the method described by Jaenson et al.
1: ( 2003) and Garboui et al.
2: ( 2007) was used.
3: The walls of transparent-plastic Falcon tubes (50 ml centrifugal tube: 116  29 mm) were perforated, to prevent the internal air saturation with the observer odor, test or control substances.
4: A 100 l of each EO solution (1 mg/ml) was applied evenly on a cotton cloth with a pipette to get a final concentration of 15 g/cm 2.
5: Control cotton cloths were treated with 100 l hexane.
6: The treated and control cloths were air dried for 2 min for solvent evaporation.
7: Freshly collected unfed  I.  ricinus nymph was introduced into Falcon tube and firstly tested with hexane treated cloth (that fixed to the Falcon upper end with the help of rubber band) for 5 min and immediately after the same nymph was tested against the EO treated cloth for another 5 min (one cloth used for each nymph).
8: In order to simulate the nymph, the observer held his hand palm on the outer surface of the cloth during the observation period (5 min).
9: The same observer conducted the entire bioassay who was attractive to ticks.
10: A tick nymph was considered attracted to the cloth if it detached all its legs from the wall of the Falcon tube and clung towards the treated cloth within 5 min, whereas the nymph which failed to reach the cloth in this time or/and turned around the Falcon tube wall was regarded as repelled (El-Seedi et al.
11: 2012).
12: Ten nymphs were used/each oil/each replicate.
13: Five replicates were used, thus the overall tick number was 50 nymphs for each EO and control group.
14: The percentage of repellency was calculated using the formula of Jaenson et al.
15: ( 2005) as follows:
