0: Chronic unpredictable stress has influence on animal behavior.
1: Here, we examined the depressive like behavior using the sucrose preference test (SPT) and forced swimming test (FST) in rat CUS model.
2: Before the start of the CUS protocol the animals were tested with the FST and SPT to determine the animals depressive state (baseline, 1 day).
3: In the period of CUS exposure (10 days) depressive like behavior was evaluated using SPT and FST as well.
4: At the end of treatments (25 days), anti-depressive effects of different drugs were evaluated using SPT and FST.
5: The weights of rats were determined in parallel with behavioral tests at 1, 10, and 25 days.
