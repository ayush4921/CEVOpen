0: The method described by Porsolt,  et al.
1: was used in our study ( 26).
2: Briefly, rats were forced to swim individually in a cylindrical glass container (70 cm height, 30 cm diameter), which contained tap water (25  1 C) to a depth 30 cm.
3: The animals were individually allowed to swim for 15 min in the swim tank and after the test; rats were dried with a towel and returned to their home cages.
4: After 24 h, same procedure was followed to conduct the test swim session for 5 min.
5: The test sessions were recorded and scored by an observer who was blind to the groups of animals.
6: The total duration of immobility during the first 5 min of the swimming session was recorded at 1, 10, and 25 days.
7: The rat was judged to be immobile when it made only the necessary movements to keep its head above water level.
