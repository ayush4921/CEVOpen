0: The 2 universal master mix (Takara, Japane) was used in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reactions.
1: The amplification program was as follows: a denaturation step of 30 s at 95 C and 35 cycles for real-time PCR including 5 s at 95 C (denaturation), 30 s at 62 C (annealing), and 1 min at 72 C (polymerase elongation).
2: A final melting curve of fluorescence  vs temperature was generated to screen for primer dimers and to document single product formation.
3: To confirm the amplification specificity of the PCR, products from each primer pairs, in addition to melting curve analysis, were subjected to subsequent agarose gel (1.5%) electrophoresis.
