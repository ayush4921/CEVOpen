0: Quantification of relative RNA expression followed established methods using real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with the SYBR green reporter dye.
1: Template cDNAs in each sample tested for quantitative expression levels of TLR-2 and TLR-4 genes and housekeeping gene (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)), using a Bio-Rad iQ5 detection system (Bio-Rad, Richmond, USA).
