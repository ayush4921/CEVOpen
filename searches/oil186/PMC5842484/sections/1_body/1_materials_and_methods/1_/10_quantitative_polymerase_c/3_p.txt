0: Primer sequences, PCR fragment length and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) accession number are reported in  Table 1.
1: The amount of PCR products were normalized with HKG primers in separate reactions.
2: All samples were assayed in duplicate.
3: Linearity and efficiency of PCR amplification were assessed using standard curves generated by decreasing amount of cDNA, using five points, diluted over a twofold range.
4: In qPCR, the relative mRNA levels were calculated by the expression 2-CT ( 27).
