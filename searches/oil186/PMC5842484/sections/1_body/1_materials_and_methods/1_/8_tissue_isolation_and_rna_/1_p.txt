0: The animals were decapitated 24 h after the last treatment.
1: Their hippocampus and prefrontal were quickly removed and were frozen on dry ice.
2: They were kept at -80 C until the use.
3: Total RNA was extracted from prefrontal cortex and hippocampus tissues (6 brain tissue samples from each group,  n = 6) by the Trizol method total RNA was treated with DNase (RNase-free DNase, Roche, Manheim, Germany).
4: The purification of RNA (A260/A280 ratio was  1.9) was determined according to OD 260/280 ratio by a spectro-photometer (Sigma, Germany).
5: The integrity of RNA was analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis (Sigma, Germany).
6: Total RNA was stored at -80 C until further analysis.
