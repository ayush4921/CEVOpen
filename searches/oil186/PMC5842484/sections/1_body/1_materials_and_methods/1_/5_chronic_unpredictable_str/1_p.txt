0: For induction of chronic stress, the Katz method was used with some modifications ( 21).
1: We used this protocol because it was used as an animal model to induce anxiety.
2: This animal model of stress consists of chronic exposure to variable unpredictable stressors, none of which is sufficient alone to induce long-lasting effects.
3: Vary stressors were used and applied in a different sequence each week to avoid any habituation.
4: Each animal received two stresses per day individually for a period of 24 days.
5: After each stressor, animals were kept in a recovery room for 1 h, following which they were placed in clean cages with fresh bedding and returned to the housing facility.
6: Control rats were individually housed for the same period of time, and were handled daily for 1 min in the housing room, but were not stressed.
