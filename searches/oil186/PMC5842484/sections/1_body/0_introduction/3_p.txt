0: The identification of active components such as thymol and carvacrol from oregano that have been shown to induce anti-anxiety effects and other bioactive polyphenols, prompted us to assess the antidepressant potential of oregano essential oil.
1: To the best of our knowledge, the antidepressant effects of oregano essential oil (OEO) have not been fully investigated.
2: In this present study, the chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) model was used to further elucidate the antidepressant-like effects of oregano.
3: In the (CUS) model ( 21), animals are subjected to a variety of unpredictable stressors continuously leading to neurochemical and behavioral changes that are similar to those found in people with depression.
4: Furthermore, since the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are critical for stress ( 222324), the corresponding changes in TLR2/4 gene expression in these important brain areas were examined along with the behavioral evaluation.
