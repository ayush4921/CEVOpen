0: At 28 days of age, all chickens were weighed.
1: Five cockerels with an average live weight within the group were selected from each replication (15 birds/group) and slaughtered by decapitation.
2: These chickens were eviscerated, and their livers were removed and stored at -70C until further analysis.
3: The left breast muscle ( M.  pectoralis major) was excised and stored at -18C for later analysis.
4: Abdominal fat pads were collected.
5: The contents of the ileum between the Meckel's diverticulum and the ileo-caecal-colonic junction were collected and pooled for 3 birds to yield 5 samples per treatment.
6: Samples were freeze-dried and used for the determination of the FA, fat, and Cr 2O 3 concentrations.
7: The livers were excised, and approximately 0.2 g tissue samples were immediately submerged in RNAlater stabilization reagent (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA), followed by overnight storage at 4C.
8: The remaining liver tissue was kept at -20C until analysis.
