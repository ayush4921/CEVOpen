0: The experiment was conducted on 240-day-old Ross 308 cockerels.
1: The chickens were randomly allocated to four groups of 60 birds each and housed in pens (2 x 1.1 m) on wood shavings, with 20 chickens per pen.
2: The experimental room was provided with gas heating and ventilation with a temperature-controlled fan.
3: Each pen was equipped with 7 nipple drinkers, 3 pan feeders and a feed hopper.
4: The temperature in the room at arrival was 32C and gradually decreased to 20C as the birds reached 28 days of age.
5: The light cycle consisted of 16 h of light and 8 h of darkness.
6: In the 1 st group (control), the fat supplement was substituted with wheat starch.
7: The following fat sources were used: rapeseed oil (2 nd group), lard (3 rd group), and palm oil (4 th group).
8: Rapeseed oil and refined palm oil were supplied by Fabio Produkt, Ltd. (Jicin, Czech Republic), and lard was purchased from a local shop.
9: All supplements were added at 60 g/kg diet.
10: Chromic oxide was mixed with the diets at 3.0 g/kg and used to measure the ileal digestibility of fatty acids.
11: The chickens were fed one type of diet from the start to the end of the experiment (days 128 of age); the diets differed in the source of fat.
12: Table 1 presents the composition and nutrient levels of the diets fed to the broiler chickens.
13: The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Institute of Animal Science.
14: The experiment lasted from the 1 st to 28 th day of chicken life.
