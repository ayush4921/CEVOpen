0: The feed was analysed as described previously [ 10].
1: Feed dry matter was determined by oven drying at 105C, ash by ashing at 550C [ 11], and fat by extraction with petroleum ether in a Soxtec 1045 apparatus (Tecator, Hoganas, Sweden).
2: The crude fibre content was analysed according to AOAC official methods [ 12].
3: The crude protein content of the feed was assayed using a Kjeltec Auto 1030 (Tecator, Hoganas, Sweden).
4: Feed calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) were determined after ashing of the samples.
5: The total P in the diets was analysed using a vanadate-molybdate reagent [ 13].
6: The calcium content was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry using a Solar M6 instrument (TJA Solutions, Cambridge, UK).
7: The phytate P contents of the diets were determined using a capillary isotachophoretic method [ 14].
8: Total lipids were extracted from the diets, hepatic tissue and breast muscle with 2:1 chloroform-methanol according to Folch et al.
9: (1957) [ 15].
10: Alkaline trans-methylation of FAs was carried out according to ISO 5509.
11: An HP 6890N gas chromatograph equipped with a programmed DB-23 capillary column (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA) was employed to determine the FA profile.
12: The Cr content in ileal samples was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry using a Solaar M6 instrument (TJA Solutions, Cambridge, UK).
