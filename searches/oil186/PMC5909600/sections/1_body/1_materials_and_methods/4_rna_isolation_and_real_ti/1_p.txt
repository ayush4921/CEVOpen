0: Stabilized liver tissue samples (20 mg) were extracted for total cellular RNA using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) following the manufacturers instructions.
1: Each sample was examined spectrophotometrically using a Nanodrop 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) to estimate the RNA concentration and purity.
2: Total RNA was used as a template for one-step PCR using a QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA).
3: The RT-PCR mixtures contained 5 L of 2x QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR Mastermix, 0.4 L of QuantiTect RT Mix (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA), 0.3 L of each forward and reverse primer (0.3 M), and 1 L of RNA template.
4: The total RNA was diluted one hundred-fold to reduce possible inhibitory effects, and each reaction contained approximately 1020 ng of RNA.
5: The total volume was brought to 10 L per reaction with an appropriate amount of RNase-free distilled water.
6: The QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit contained ROX as a passive reference dye.
7: Real-time PCR and data analysis were performed on 384-well plates using a 7900HT thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA).
8: The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 50C for 30 min for reverse transcription, followed by 95C for 15 min and 40 PCR cycles with denaturing at 94C for 15 seconds, annealing at 60C for 30 seconds and elongation at 72C for 15 seconds.
9: Each sample was measured in triplicate.
10: After PCR amplification, a melting curve analysis was performed.
11: The following oligonucleotide primer pairs were used: beta actin (BACT, used as an internal control in all reactions,  5-GAGGCAGCTGTGGCCATCT,  3-AAATTGTGCGTGCATCAAGGA, accession number AY_045724), 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase,  5-ATGATTTCAAGTTGTCGCACTCC, 3-TAGGTCCTACATTTACCCTGGATG, accession number NM_204485), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 ( 5-TGACGTCGATTTCTGCTGCT, 3-GCAGCGCGATCTGAATGAAG) [ 16], fatty acid synthase ( 5-CAATGGACTTCATGCCTCGGT, 3-GCTGGGTACTGGAAGACAAACA) [ 17], 5-fatty acid desaturase ( 5-GAGCCATCGGTGAGGGTTTC, 3-CTCCAGTCCTTTCCTTGCGT) [ 16], -9-fatty acid desaturase (5- GGAGCCCTAGGAGAAGGTTTC, 3-AAATTGAAGCGCCAGCCAAA) [ 16], 6-fatty acid desaturase (QuantiTect Primer Assay, QT01510824).
12: All primers were synthesised by Generi Biotech Ltd. (Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic), and the QuantiTect Primer Assays were purchased from Dynex Ltd. (Bustehrad, Czech Republic).
13: The 2 -CT method was used for the quantification of all gene expression relative to internal control levels.
