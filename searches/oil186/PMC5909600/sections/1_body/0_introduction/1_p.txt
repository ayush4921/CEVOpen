0: Supplemental fats are often used to increase dietary energy density to meet the requirements of fast-growing broiler chickens.
1: Different fats and oils are usable in poultry nutrition: tallow, lard, palm fats and oils, vegetable oils, by-products of oil refining, and recovered frying oils [ 1].
2: Fats and oils contain fat-soluble vitamins, supply essential fatty acids, improve the palatability of feed, and reduce friction in feed mills.
3: The major component of fats and oils is fatty acids (FAs).
4: Fats and oils vary in their FA composition.
5: The metabolism of fats depends primarily on the fatty acid (FA) profile.
6: Tancharoenrat et al.
7: (2014) [ 2] showed that unsaturated FAs were well digested in the lower ileum irrespective of the source of fat.
8: The digestibility of saturated FAs (palmitic and stearic) was higher in a diet containing soybean oil (50 g/kg) than in a diet containing tallow (50 g/kg).
9: A significant proportion of synthesized and absorbed saturated FAs (SFAs) are desaturated in tissues by desaturases to monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs).
10: Fatty acid synthase produces saturated fatty acids (palmitate, stearate).
11: Fatty acids are elongated and desaturated by enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.
12: For example, the conversion of stearoyl-CoA to oleyl-CoA is catalysed by a complex of three membrane-bound proteins:  StearoylCoA+NADH+H++O2oleylCoA+NAD++2H2O A variety of unsaturated fatty acids can be formed from oleate by a combination of elongation and desaturation reactions [ 3].
13: Kouba and Mourot (1998) [ 4] showed that polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) in the diet inhibited stearoyl-9-desaturase in the liver, resulting in reduced conversion of SFAs to MUFAs.
14: Increasing the content of linoleic acid (C 18:2) in the diet and in the hepatic tissue of broiler chickens decreased the desaturation of SFAs to MUFAs [ 5].
15: The FA profile of different tissues reflects the dietary FA profile [ 6].
16: Moreover, the partitioning of absorbed FAs is different in MUFAs and PUFAs.
17: In chickens fed diets supplemented with four types of fat, MUFAs were higher in abdominal fat, whereas PUFAs were higher in muscle lipids [ 7].
18: Crespo and Esteve-Garcia (2002) [ 8] reported that broilers fed diets enriched with PUFAs deposited less abdominal and body fat than those fed SFAs or MUFAs, mainly due to the higher oxidation rate of PUFAs.
19: The metabolism of FAs in birds and mammals is different.
20: In mammals, most  de novo synthesis of FAs occurs in adipose tissue, whereas in birds, most of the fat that is deposited in adipose tissue originates from lipid synthesis in the liver [ 9].
