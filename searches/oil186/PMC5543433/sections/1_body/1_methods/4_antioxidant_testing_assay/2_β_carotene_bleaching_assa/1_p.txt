0: The antioxidant activity was determined according to the -carotene bleaching method described by Pratt [ 11].
1: A stock solution of -carotene/linoleic acid mixture was prepared as follows: 0.5 mg of -carotene (PubChem CID: 5,280,489) was dissolved in 1 ml of chloroform (PubChem CID: 6212) with 25 l of linoleic acid (PubChem CID: 5,280,450) and 200 mg of Tween-20 (PubChem CID: 443,314).
2: Chloroform was completely evaporated, using a vacuum evaporator.
3: Then, 100 ml of distilled water, saturated with oxygen (30 min), were added and the obtained solution was vigorously shaken.
4: Four ml of this reaction mixture were dispensed into test tubes and 200 l of each sample, prepared at different concentrations, were added.
5: The emulsion system was incubated for 2 h at 50 C. The same procedure was repeated with Butylated hydoxytoluene (BHT) as positive control and a blank as a negative control.
6: After this incubation period, the absorbance of each mixture was measured at 490 nm.
7: Antioxidant activity in -carotene bleaching model in percentage (A %) was calculated with the following equation: A %  = 1  (A 0  A t/A 0A t)  100, where A 0 and A 0 are absorbances of the sample and the blank, respectively, measured at zero time, and A  t and A t are absorbances of the sample and the blank, respectively, measured after 2 h. All tests were carried out in triplicate.
