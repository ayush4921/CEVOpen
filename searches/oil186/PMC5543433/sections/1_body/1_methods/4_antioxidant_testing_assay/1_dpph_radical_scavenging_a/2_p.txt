0: OD blank is the absorbance of the control reaction containing all reagents except the tested compound.
1: OD sample is the absorbance of the test compound.
2: Extract concentration providing 50% inhibition (IC 50) was calculated from the graph plotting inhibition percentage against extract concentration.
3: Tests were carried out in triplicate.
