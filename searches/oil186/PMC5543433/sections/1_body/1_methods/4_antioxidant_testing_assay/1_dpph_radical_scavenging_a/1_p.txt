0: Radical scavenging activity of the different fractions was determined using DPPH radical as a reagent according to the method of Kirby and Schmidt with some modifications [ 10].
1: Briefly, 1 ml of a 4% ( w/ v) solution of DPPH radical in ethanol (PubChem CID: 702) was mixed with 500 l of sample solutions (different concentrations).
2: The mixture was incubated for 20 min in the dark at room temperature.
3: Scavenging capacity was read spectrophotometrically by monitoring the decrease of the absorbance at 517 nm.
4: Lower absorbance of the reaction mixture indicates higher free radical scavenging activity.
5: Ascorbic acid was used as standard.
6: DPPH radical scavenging activity (%) was calculated according to the formula: DPPH radical scavenging activity (%) = [(OD blank  OD sample)/OD blank]  100.
