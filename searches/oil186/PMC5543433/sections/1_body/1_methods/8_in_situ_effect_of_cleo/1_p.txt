0: The in situ efficacy of the  ClEO was evaluated against  L. monocytogenes in minced beef meat model according to the procedure described by Ben Hsouna et al.
1: [ 5] and Careaga et al.
2: [ 14] with slight modifications.
3: Briefly, a fresh working culture of  L. monocytogenes containing about 10 6 CFU/ml was prepared by suspending 35 isolated colonies in 10 ml of Mueller-Hinton broth (MH) and was cultured overnight at 37 C for 24 h to reach the stationary phase.
4: Freshly post-rigor lean beef muscles were obtained from a slaughterhouse in Sfax-Tunisia and transported to the laboratory in insulated polystyrene boxes on ice within 1 h of the chopping process.
5: A healthy and freshly slaughtered animal has its muscle sterile [ 15].
6: In order to reduce the number of microorganisms attached to the surface of beef muscle, each piece was immersed in boiling water for 5 min.
7: The cooked surface of the muscle was eliminated with sterile knives under aseptic conditions.
8: The pieces of meat prepared as described above were minced in a sterile grinder, and portions of 25  0.1 g were placed in bags.
9: Half of the meat samples were inoculated with 2  10 2 CFU of  L. monocytogenes/g of meat and mixed homogeneously for 3 min at room temperature to ensure proper distribution of the pathogen.
10: Before inoculation of the second half of meat, the  ClEO was dissolved in 10% DMSO, filtered through 0.22 m pore-size black polycarbonate filters (Millipore) and was then added two concentrations of 2MIC and 3MIC corresponding to 0.06 and 0.312 mg of  ClEO/g of meat, respectively; and mixed to evenly distribute the microorganisms.
11: All bags containing the samples of meat were stored at 7 C and examined at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 days of storage for  L. monocytogenes enumeration.
12: After predetermined intervals, the  L. monocytogenes isolation was done by removing the pieces aseptically and blending with 250 ml of MH.
13: The samples were homogenized for 1 min, and incubated at 37 C for 6 h. From this pre-enrichment (for the resuscitation of possible injured living cells), the remaining  L. monocytogenes was determined by the plate colony count technique.
14: After serial 10-fold dilution technique with physiological saline solution, 100 l of each sample were spread onto surfaces of the Muller Hinton agar medium followed by incubation at 37 C for 24 h. Sterile saline water was added in the untreated control instead of  ClEO, inoculated with the test bacteria and stored under the same conditions as the other samples.
15: Three individual replicates of each experiment were performed, in all cases.
