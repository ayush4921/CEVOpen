0: TBARS were determined according to the method of Eymard et al.
1: [ 17].
2: Two grams of sample were mixed with 100 l of BHT (PubChem CID: 31,404) in ethanol (1 g/l) and 16 ml of trichloroacetic acid (TCA 50 g/l) (PubChem CID: 6421).
3: Samples were homogenized by a kitchen blender for 10 min then filtered.
4: Two ml of filtrate (or 2 ml of TCA for blank) were added to 2 ml of thiobarbituric acid (PubChem CID: 2,723,628) solution (20 mol/l).
5: The tightly closed tubes were heated at 70 C for 30 min and rapidly cooled in ice.
6: Absorbance was read against the blank at 508 (A508nm), 532 (A532nm) and 600 (A600nm) with a spectrophotometer (T 60UV- visible Spectrophotometer, PG instruments).
7: The absorbance measured at the maximum (A532 nm) was corrected for the baseline drift as follows: A532 nm corrected = A532 nm  [((A508 nm  A600 nm)  (600  532))/(600/508)]  A600 nm.
8: Results were expressed as mg of malonaldehyde (MDA) equivalents per kg of sample (mg/kg) using the molar extinction coefficient of the MDATBA adduct at 532 nm (1.56  105 M  1 cm  1) according to Buege and Aust [ 18].
9: The MDA was determined using the following formula: mgMDAeq/kg = (A corrected  VTCA  2  MMDA .
10: 10  2)/(1.56  m).
