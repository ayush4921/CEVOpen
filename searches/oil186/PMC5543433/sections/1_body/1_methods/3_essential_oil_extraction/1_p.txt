0: The oil extraction was obtained from 1 kg fresh plant by steam distillation during 3 h using a Clevenger-type apparatus [ 9].
1: The aqueous phase was extracted with dichloromethane (3  50 ml) and dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate (PubChem CID: 24,243).
2: After filtration the solvent is eliminated by pressure distillation reduced in rotary evaporator and pure oil was stored at 4 C in obscurity till the beginning of  ClEO analysis.
3: The amount of oil obtained from each plant material was calculated as:
