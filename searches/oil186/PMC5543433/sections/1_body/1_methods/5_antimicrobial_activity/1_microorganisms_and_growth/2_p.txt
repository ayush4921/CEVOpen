0: The following fungal strains were also tested:  Aspergillus niger CTM 10099 , Aspergillus flavus (food isolate) , Aspergillus nidulans (food isolate),  Aspergillus fumigatus (food isolate),  Fusarium graminearum (ISPAVE 271 ), Fusarium oxysporum (CTM10402) , Fusarium culmorum (ISPAVE 21w) and  Alternaria alternata (CTM 10230) .
1: The bacterial strains were grown on Mueller Hinton broth (Bio-Rad, France) at 37 C for 1214 h while potato dextrose agar (PDA) (1.5% agar) at 28 C for 4 days were used for fungi.
2: Inocula were prepared from an overnight broth culture by their dilution in saline solution to approximately 10 7 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml for bacteria and 10 5 spores/ml for fungus.
