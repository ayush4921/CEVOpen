0: The analysis of the essential oil was performed on a GCMS HP model 6980 inert MSD (Agilent Technologies, J&W Scientific Products, Palo Alto, CA, USA), equipped with an Agilent Technologies capillary HP-5MS column (60 m length; 0.25 mm i.d.
1: ; 0.25 mm film thickness), and coupled to a mass selective detector (MSD5973, ionization voltage 70 eV; all Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).
2: The carrier gas was Helium and was used at 1.2 ml/min flow rate.
3: The oven temperature program was as follows: 1 min at 100 C ramped from 100 to 280 C at 5 C min 1 and 25 min at 280 C. The chromatograph was equipped with a split/split less injector used in the split less mode.
4: Relative proportion of each component was expressed as percentage obtained by peak area normalization, all relative response factors being taken as one.
5: Their Kovats indices were calculated using a homologous series of C 10-C 22n-alkanes injected at the same conditions.
6: Identification of components was assigned by matching their mass spectra with Wiley Registry of Mass Spectral Data 7th edition (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) and National Institute of Standards and Technology 05 MS (NIST) library data.
7: Identifications were also made by comparison of their Kovats retention indices with private reference libraries and from the literature.
