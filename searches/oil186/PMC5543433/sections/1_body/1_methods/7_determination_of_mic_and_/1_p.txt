0: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of  ClEO were determined according to Gulluce et al.
1: [ 13] against a panel of 21 microorganisms representing different species of different ecosystems.
2: The test was performed in sterile 96-well microplates with a final volume in each microplate well of 100 l. A stock solution of the  ClEO (50 mg/ml) was prepared in DMSO/water (1/9).
3: The inhibitory activity of the  ClEO was properly prepared and transferred to each well in order to obtain a twofold serial dilution of the original sample and to produce the concentration range of 0.03910 mg/ml.
4: To each test well 10 l of cell suspension were added to final inoculums concentrations of 10 6 CFU/ml for bacteria and 10 5 spores/ml for fungus.
5: Positive growth control wells consisted of bacteria or fungi only in their adequate medium.
6: DMSO/water (1/9) (PubChem CID: 679) was used as negative control.
7: The plates were then covered with the sterile plate covers and incubated at 37 C for 24 h for bacterial strains and 72 h for fungi at 28 C. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of the total essential oil at which the microorganism does not demonstrate visible growth after incubation.
8: As an indicator of microorganism growth, 25 l of Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide (PubChem CID: 64,965) (MTT), indicator solution (0.5 mg/ml) dissolved in sterile water were added to the wells and incubated at 37 C for 30 min.
9: The colourless tetrazolium salt acts as an electron acceptor and is reduced to a red-coloured formazan product by biologically active organisms.
10: Where microbial growth was inhibited, the solution in the well remained clear after incubation with MTT.
11: The minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) were determined by serial subcultivation of 10 l in Potatoes Dextrose Agar (PDA) plates and incubated for 72 h at 28 C. The lowest concentration with no visible growth was defined as the MFC, indicating 99.5% killing of the original inoculum.
12: DMSO and ethanol were used as a negative control.
13: The determinations of MIC and MFC values were done in triplicate.
