0: Antibacterial and antifungal tests were performed by agar well diffusion method as described by Tagg and McGiven [ 12] and broth microdilution assay using sterile MuellerHinton media (Bio-Rad, France) for bacterial strains and potato dextrose agar (Bio-Rad,France) for antifungal tests.
1: Fifteen milliliters of the molten agar (45 C) were poured into sterile petri dishes ( 90 mm).
2: Working cell suspensions were prepared and 100 l were evenly spread onto the surface of the agar plates of Mueller-Hinton agar (Oxoid Ltd., UK) for bacteria, or potatoes dextrose agar medium (Oxoid Ltd., UK) for fungi.
3: Once the plates had been aseptically dried, 06 mm wells were punched into the agar with a sterile Pasteur pipette.
4: The  ClEO were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)/water (1/1) and sterile water to a final concentration of 50 mg/ml.
5: Thus, 50 l were placed into the wells and the plates were incubated at 37 C for 24 h for bacterial strains and 72 h for fungi at 28 C. Gentamicin (10 g/wells), Amphotericin B (PubChem CID: 5,280,965) at 20 g/wells and DMSO served as positive and negative control.
6: Antimicrobial activity was evaluated by measuring the diameter of circular inhibition zones around the well.
7: Tests were performed in triplicate.
