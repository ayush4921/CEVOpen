0: Foods contaminated with  Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and  Salmonella has been reported as the causal agents of foodborne diseases [ 5,  6].
1: One of the most important psychrotrophic food pathogens related to anaerobically packed cooked meat products and shelf-life failures of conserved foods is  Listeria monocytogenes.
2: This organism is the causal agent of listeriosis, a disease that can be serious and is often fatal in susceptible individuals, caused by eating contaminated food [ 7].
3: Thus, to prevent contamination during the production, sale and distribution and to extend the shelf life time of raw and/or processed foods, synthetic additives should be used.
4: However, there is a strong debate about the safety aspects of these chemical preservatives since they are considered responsible for many carcinogenic and teratogenic attributes as well as residual toxicity [ 8].
5: Thus, a growing attention is being paid to plants and herbs naturally derived compounds as a new alternative to prevent the proliferation of microorganism and protect food from oxidation.
6: Generally, little information exists on the in vivo antimicrobial efficacy of plant essential oils against food-borne pathogens in meat.
7: To the best of our knowledge, the antimicrobial activity of  Citrus limon essential oil ( ClEO) against a wide range of food-associated microorganisms (bacteria, moulds, and yeasts) has not been studied.
8: The purposes of the present work were (i) to evaluate the chemical composition of Tunisian lemon EO ( ClEO) by GC-MS, (ii) to study in vitro the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of  ClEO, (iii) to assess the effect of  ClEO on physicochemical of raw minced beef meat stored at 4 C, and (iv) to determine the efficacy of  ClEO in inhibiting  L. monocytogenes growth in raw minced beef meat during refrigerated storage.
