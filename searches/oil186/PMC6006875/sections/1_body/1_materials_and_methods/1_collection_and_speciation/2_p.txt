0: Speciation of the  Candida from the clinical samples was done, and they were further subcultured on Sauboraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) twice to confirm pure isolation of the yeast.
1: The different species of  Candida were first identified by Gram staining and later on confirmed by germ tube test, corn meal agar for chlamydospore formation and Chromagar, and other biochemical tests.
2: Chrome  Candida differentiation agar was used to differentiate  Candida species.
3: Chromagar for differentiation of  Candida (Himedia, Mumbai, India) was prepared following manufacturer's instructions.
4: C. albicans was differentiated as the colony exhibited light green color.
5: Along with colonies of  C. albicans, steel-/blue-colored colonies of  Candida tropicalis and light pink-colored colonies of  Candida glabrata were observed and identified [ Figure 2].
