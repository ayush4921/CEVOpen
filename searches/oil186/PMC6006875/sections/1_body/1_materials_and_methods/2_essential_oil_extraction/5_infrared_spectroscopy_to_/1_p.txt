0: IR spectroscopy method was used to identify the active functional group using Bruker Fourier transform infrared alpha model, Germany [ Figure 6].
1: The transmitted light frequencies were recorded to obtain IR spectrum [ Figure 7], and it was later compared with existing database for the presence of active groups.
