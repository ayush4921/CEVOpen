0: The extract (70 g) was suspended in distilled water (1500 ml) and then extracted successively with petroleum ether (60C80C, 8  500 ml), chloroform (8  500 ml), ethyl acetate (8  500 ml), n-butanol (8  500 ml), and methanol (8  500 ml).
1: All the fractions were then washed with distilled water (30 ml), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and freed of solvent by distillation.
2: The ethanolic extract was thus fractionated into petroleum ether soluble extract (13 g), chloroform soluble extract (10 g), ethyl acetate soluble extract (7 g), n-butanol soluble extract (6 g), and methanol soluble extract (23 g).
