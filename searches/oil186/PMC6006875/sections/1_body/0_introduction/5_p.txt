0: Hence,  O. vulgare was chosen to characterize its antifungal effects on oral isolates of  Candida from a denture wearer with CADS.
1: The organisms were collected from the patients affected with CADS.
2: The essential oil was extracted from the leaves of the plant, and the antifungal activity was confirmed using well diffusion method against  Candida species.
3: The efficacy of two extraction methods, hydrodistillation and maceration, was compared.
4: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of the herb were determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
5: The active functional group in the experimental herb was identified as a compound similar to carvacrol through infrared (IR) spectroscopy method.
