0:  Effect of LEO on phosphorylation of NF-B in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells.
1: RAW264.7 cells (1.8  10 6 cells/ml) were pre-incubated for 18 h, and the cells were stimulated with LPS (1 g/l) in the presence of LEO (0.01, 0.02, and 0.04 %) for 30 min.
2: The levels of p-p50, p 50, p-IB- and IB- were determined using Western blot method. )
