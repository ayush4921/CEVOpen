0:  Effect of LEO on NO and PGE 2 production in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells.
1: Cells (1.8  10 5 cells/ml) were stimulated by LPS (1 g/l) for 24h in the presence of LEO (0.01, 0.02, and 0.04 %).
2: (A) Cytotoxicity of LEO was assessed by MTT.
3: Supernatants were collected, and the (B) NO and (C) PGE 2 concentration in the supernatants was determined using Griess reaction and the enzyme immunoassay, respectively.
4: Values are expressed as means  S.D.
