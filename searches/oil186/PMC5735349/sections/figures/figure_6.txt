0:  Effect of LEO on phosphorylation of MAPK in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells.
1: RAW264.7 cells (1.8  10 6 cells/ml) were pre-incubated for 18 h, and the cells were stimulated with LPS (1 g/l) in the presence of LEO (0.01, 0.02, and 0.04 %) for 30 min.
2: The levels of p-ERK, ERK, p-JNK, JNK, p-p38 and p38 were determined using Western blot method. )
