0:  Effects of LEO on production of iNOS and COX-2 protein in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells.
1: RAW264.7 cells (1.8  10 5 cells/ml) were pre-incubated for 18 h, and the cells were stimulated with LPS (1 g/l) in the presence of LEO (0.01, 0.02, and 0.04 %) for 24 h. iNOS and COX-2 protein levels were determined via Western blot method. )
