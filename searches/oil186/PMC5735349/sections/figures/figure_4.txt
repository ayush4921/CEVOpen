0:  Effect of LEO on IL-6 and TNF- production in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells.
1: Cells (1.8  10 5 cells/ml) were stimulated by LPS (1 g/l) for 24 h in the presence of LEO (0.01, 0.02, and 0.04 %).
2: Supernatants were collected, and the IL-6 and TNF- concentration in the supernatants was determined by ELISA.
3: Values are expressed as means  S.D.
