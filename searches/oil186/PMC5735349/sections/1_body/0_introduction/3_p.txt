0: Lindera erythrocarpa is widely distributed in the Republic of Korea, Japan, and China (Sun and Chung, 1988[ 35]).
1: Lindera species, including  L. strychnifolia,  L. lucida,  L. chunii, and  L. aggregate are important medicinal plants.
2: The fruit and leaves of  L. erythrocarpa are used in folk medicine for treating digestive disorders, thirst, pain, and neuralgia.
3: They are also used as antidotes and diuretics (Hong et al., 2009[ 13]; Oh et al., 2005[ 28]; Sun and Chung, 1988[ 35]).
4: Recently,  L. erythrocarpa was reported to suppress adipogenesis and melanin synthesis, attenuate obesity, as well as exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antifungal activities (Hsieh and Wang, 2013[ 15]; Hwang et al., 2007[ 16]; Kumar et al., 2010[ 19]; Wang et al., 2008[ 40]).
5: Essential oils extracted from medicinal and aromatic plants are known to have biological effects, most notably anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antifungal, and antibacterial activities (Chaieb et al., 2007[ 4]; Pinheiro et al., 2011[ 29]).
6: These properties are a driving interest in the use of essential oils in the cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and food industries (Chaieb et al., 2007[ 4]; Lang and Buchbauer, 2012[ 20]; Tumen et al., 2010[ 37]).
7: However, the mechanism by which  L. erythrocarpa essential oil (LEO) exerts its anti-inflammatory effect has not been elucidated.
8: Therefore, in this study, we examined the anti-inflammatory effects of LEO and its constituents on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells.
