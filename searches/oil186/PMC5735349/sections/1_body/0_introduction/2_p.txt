0: Nuclear transcription factor kappa-B (NF-B) regulates a variety of genes associated with immune and acute-phase inflammatory responses.
1: The activation of NF-B due to pro-inflammatory stimulation is indicated by rapid phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitors of kappa B (IBs) (Rajapakse et al., 2008[ 30]).
2: Freed NF-B dimers from this process translocate to the nucleus and bind to the promoter regions of target genes (Lee et al., 2003[ 21]).
3: They then induce the transcription of pro-inflammatory mediators such as iNOS, COX-2, IL-6, IL-1, and TNF- (Makarov, 2000[ 25]; Yoshimura, 2006[ 44]).
4: Recent studies have reported that the anti-inflammatory effect of phytochemicals occurs through blocking of the NF-B signaling pathway (Ham et al., 2015[ 11]; Hsieh et al., 2011[ 14]).
5: Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are one of the major kinases involved in cellular processes such as apoptosis, stress responses, differentiation, and immune defense (Liu et al., 2007[ 23]).
6: MAPKs comprise three major subgroups, namely, p38 MAPKs, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs).
7: Their activation plays an important role in the expression of iNOS and COX-2 and in the production of cytokines (Rajapakse et al., 2008[ 30]; Rao, 2001[ 31]).
8: Therefore, MAPK and NF-B may be effective as anti-inflammatory agents.
