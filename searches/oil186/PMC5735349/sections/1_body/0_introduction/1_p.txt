0: Prolonged inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis, atherosclerosis, chronic hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory brain diseases (Chung et al., 2007[ 7]).
1: Inflammation is caused by pro-inflammatory mediators, including both pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6, and pro-inflammatory factors such as nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 (Ljung et al., 2006[ 24]; Walsh et al., 2005[ 39]).
2: Therefore, inhibition of these inflammatory mediators is an important target pathway in the treatment of diseases with anti-inflammatory components.
