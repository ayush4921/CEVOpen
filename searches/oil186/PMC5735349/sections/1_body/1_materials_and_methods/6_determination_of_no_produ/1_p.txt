0: RAW264.7 cells (1.8  10 5 cells/ml) were plated in 24 well-plates for 24 h and then cultured with LPS (1 g/ml) in the absence or presence of LEO (0.01 %, 0.02 %, and 0.04 %) for 24 h. The amount of nitrite that accumulated in the culture medium was measured and used as an indicator of NO production.
1: Briefly, 100 l of cell culture medium was mixed with an equal volume of 1 X Griess reagent, and incubated at room temperature for 10 min.
2: Absorbance was then measured at 540 nm.
3: A fresh culture medium was used as the blank in every experiment.
