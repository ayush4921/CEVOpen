0: RAW264.7 cells were treated with LPS in the absence or presence of the aforementioned concentration of LEO.
1: After incubation, the cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer.
2: The cell lysates were then isolated by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 ^C.
3: Protein concentration in the supernatants was measured by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and all proteins were adjusted to an equal protein content.
4: Aliquots of the lysates (20~30 g protein/lane) were separated on a NuPAGE 4-12 % bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and the separated proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes using an iBlot gel transfer device (Invitrogen).
5: The membranes were immersed in 5 % non-fat skim milk, which was used as a blocking solution and incubated with primary antibodies (1:1,000) at 4 C for 24 h. After incubating, the membranes were washed several times with Tween 20-Tris-buffered saline and incubated with secondary horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (1:5,000, Cell Signaling Technology) for 90 min.
6: After washing, immunoactive proteins were detected using the WEST-ZOL (plus) Western Blot Detection System (iNtRON Biotechnology, Gyeonggi, Korea).
