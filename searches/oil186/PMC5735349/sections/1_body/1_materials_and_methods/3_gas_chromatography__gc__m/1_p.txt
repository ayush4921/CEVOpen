0: Analysis of the main components of the most active essential oil extracted from  L.  erythrocarpa leaves was carried out using a GC (Agilent 6890, Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) connected to an MS (Agilent 5975).
1: The GC was equipped with a DB1-HT column (30 m  0.32 mm; 0.1 m film thickness).
2: The oven temperature was programmed to increase from 40 to 100C at a rate of 2 C/min, and then from 100 to 230 C at a rate of 5 C/min, after which it was held at 230 C for 5 min.
3: The detector and injector temperatures were 280 C and 240 C, respectively.
4: The flow rate of the carrier gas (He) was 1.5 ml/min and the split ratio was 1:10.
5: For the sample injection (split less), 10 l of LEO was diluted in 500 l of CH 2Cl 2 and 1 l of this solution was injected for analysis.
6: Identification of the compounds was done by comparison of their mass spectra with reference spectra in the Wiley libraries.
7: The GC-MS retention indices were also calculated using a homologous series of n-alkanes (C6-C31).
