0: The cytotoxicity of LEO against RAW264.7 cells was examined via an MTT assay.
1: RAW264.7 cells (1.8  10 5 cells/ml) were plated in 96-well plates for 24 h and then treated with aliquots of LEO at 37 C for 24 h. MTT solution was added to each well for 4 h. The plates were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatants were removed by aspiration.
2: The formazan crystals in each well were dissolved in DMSO and absorbance was measured at 540 nm.
