0:  PUFA are essential fatty acids and they can be divided into two groups; omega 3 and omega 6.
1: Based on their structures, each group has important roles in the improvement of the immune system, prevention of cancer and cardiovascular diseases.
2: 4 Commonly consumed oils, such as sunflower, corn, grape seed and rice bran oils, have high levels of  6 fatty acids and, thus, lead to increases in the ratio of  6 compared to  3 fatty acids.
3: The optimal ratio and balance of these fatty acids has an important effect on their functional properties.
4: 5 Unfortunately, there is no pure fat or oil that has a balanced amount of essential fatty acids, good oxidative stability and optimum nutritional characteristics.
5: For example, linseed oil is rich in  3 fatty acids, which are easily oxidized, while sesame and olive oils are very stable to oxidation but contain low levels of  3 fatty acids.
