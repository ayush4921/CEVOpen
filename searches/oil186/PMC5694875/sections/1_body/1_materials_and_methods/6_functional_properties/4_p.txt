0: The bulk density was determined essentially as described by OmowayeTaiwo et al.
1: ( 2015).
2: Foaming capacity (FC) and foaming stability (FS) were carried out as described by SzeTao and Sathe ( 2000).
3: The sample (0.5 g) was dispersed in 50 ml of distilled water in a 100 ml graduated cylinder and the solutions homogenized at a speed of 1,600   g for 5 min.
4: The volume was recorded before and after whipping.
5: FC was expressed as the volume (%) increase due to whipping.
6: This was then stored for 1 hr and the foamvolume changes in the graduated cylinder were recorded as FS.
7: Both were calculated in percentages as shown below: Foaming capacity=Volume after homogenizationVolume before homogenizationVolume before homogenization100%Foaming stability=The volume of foam after a set timeInitial volume of foam100%
