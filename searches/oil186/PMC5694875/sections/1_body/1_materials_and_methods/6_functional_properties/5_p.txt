0: Emulsion capacity (EC) was determined according to the method of Chavan et al.
1: ( 2001).
2: One gram of the sample in 25 ml distilled water was homogenized at a speed of 5,000   g for 1 min at 27C.
3: The protein solution was then mixed with 25 ml of soybean oil followed by homogenization at 10,000   g for 1 min.
4: The emulsion volume was then used in calculating the EC as shown below: Emulsion capacity=Height of emulsified layerHeight of the contents of the tube100.
