0: The least gelation concentration (LGC) was determined according to the method described by Abbey and Ibeh ( 1988).
1: The sample was weighed and mixed with 5 ml of distilled water in a test tube to obtain 2%20% (w/v) concentrations.
2: The test tube was heated for 1 hr in a boiling water bath followed by rapid cooling under running tap water and further cooled for 2 hr in a refrigerator at 4C.
3: The LGC was regarded as the least concentration at which the sample from the inverted tube did not fall or slip.
