0: The various samples of conophor nuts were defatted as described by OmowayeTaiwo, Fagbemi, Ogunbusola, and Badejo ( 2015) and the resultant flour stored at 4C for further analyses.
1: Protein isolates were prepared from the defatted flour samples using isoelectric point method as described by Gbadamosi, Abiose, and Aluko ( 2012b) with slight modification.
2: Briefly, the flour:water (1:20 [w/v]) was stirred on a magnetic stirrer continually for 2 hr at room temperature at pH 10, and the slurry formed was centrifuged at 4,000   g for 40 min at 4C.
3: The insoluble conophor nut residue was redissolved with pH adjusted as above and coldcentrifuged again.
4: The two supernatants were mixed together and adjusted to pH 4.5 and kept for 2 hr at room temperature and subsequently centrifuged at 4,000 x  g for 40 min at 4C.
5: The precipitate was washed with distilled water, redissolved in water, neutralized to pH 7 at room temperature, dialyzed for 6 hr and then freezedried.
