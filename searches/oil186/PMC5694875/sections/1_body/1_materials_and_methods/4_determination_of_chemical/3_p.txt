0: HPLC system was used to determine the amino acid profiles of the protein isolates after hydrolyzing for 24 hr with 6 mol/L HCl as described by Bidlingmeyer, Cohen, and Tarvin ( 1984).
1: The sulfur amino acids, cysteine, and methionine, were determined after oxidizing with performic acid (Gehrke, Wall, Absheer, Kaiser, & Zumwalt,  1985) and tryptophan content was determined using spectrophotometer after alkaline hydrolysis (Landry & Delhaye,  1992).
