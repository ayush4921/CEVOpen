0: Fish were recorded in the untreated environment for 3 min, in the presence of a control solution (distilled water) for 3 min, and finally, in the presence of 1.5 mL media, which was taken from epithelial cells after 24 h of culture ( Fig.
1: 2).
2: Seconds of darting behavior by each fish under each condition was calculated from the digital record.
3: In our model, darting was the most robust antipredatory behavior observed.
4: Different species may exhibit other behaviors more prominently.
5: Therefore, quantify the most consistently expressed antipredatory behavior.
6: Darting behavior for each fish was measured; nine trials were completed.
7: Data were analyzed using a  t-test in GraphPad Prism.
8: p values of 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
