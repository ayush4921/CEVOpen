0: All reagents should be used at room temperature.
1: Remove fish from the home tank and place in 1.5 L of water containing 400 L of an oil of cloves solution (1:10 clove oil in 95% ethanol (should yield a concentration of 100 mg/L) (store in a dark bottle as solution is light sensitive).
2: The solution should induce a light plane of anesthesia in fish in approximately 5 min.
3: When the fish is unable to right itself in the water and/or does not try to avoid handling, collection can begin.
4: Place the fish on its ventral side on a wet paper towel and gently abrade the epidermis with a sterile scalpel blade.
5: Focus cell collection on the anterior end of the animal and avoid removal of scales.
6: Place epidermal cells in a 15 mL polypropylene conical vial containing 10 mL room temperature phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (no calcium or magnesium) (Life Sciences) supplemented with 1.5% penicillin/streptavidin solution (10,000 IU/mL, GIbco) and 1.5% Fungizone   (antimycotic, Gibco), 1.5% kanamycin (Gibco), and 1.5% tetracycline (Gibco) (this solution will be referred to as supplemented PBS).
7: Sample collection should take less than 60 s. Immediately afterwards, place the fish back into its home tank and observe for normal behaviors.
8: Recovery from anesthesia should occur within minutes.
9: Pool cells from six fish.
