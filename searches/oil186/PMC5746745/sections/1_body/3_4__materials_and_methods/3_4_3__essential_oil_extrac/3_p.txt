0: For  13C NMR analyses, the plant material (6001000 mg) was split into 3 different 10 mL glass tubes.
1: Then, 2 mL of chloroform-d was added to the first tube, shacked gently and left at room temperature for 15 min.
2: The chloroform was then transferred into the second tube and the whole process repeated.
3: This procedure was also performed for the third tube.
4: After drying with magnesium sulphate, finally 600 L of the chloroform extract were placed in a NMR tube for  1H and  13C analyses.
