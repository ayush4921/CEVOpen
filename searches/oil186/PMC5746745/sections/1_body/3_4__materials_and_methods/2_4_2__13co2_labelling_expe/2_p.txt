0: In preliminary experiments, performed with 5-month-old WT plants, pulse and chase periods adequate to produce detectable  13C enrichments were determined.
1: To this end, pots were feed for six different pulse periods beginning with 1.0 h up to 8.8 h. Chase periods varied from 0 to 264 h. The time settings for each experiment are listed in  Table S1.
