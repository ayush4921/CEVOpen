0: Labelling experiments were performed with controls and transgenic HMGR5 plants.
1: For  13CO 2 feeding, three or four potted plants were simultaneously placed in a closed gas incubation chamber (Biobox; GWS, Berlin, Germany) at 25 C and illuminated with white light ( Figure 10).
2: Prior to the labelling period (pulse phase), the chamber was flushed with synthetic air containing oxygen and nitrogen until CO 2 was fully removed.
3: The plants were then fed with synthetic air containing 700 ppm of  13CO 2.
4: During this pulse period, the concentration of  13CO 2 and  12CO 2 was typically detected at a ratio of 9:1.
5: Subsequently, the plants were transferred to the laboratory.
