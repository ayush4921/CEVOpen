0: Each sample was analyzed three times in SIM (single ion monitoring) mode.
1: The relative intensities of the standards (camphor and 1,8-cineole) and the samples obtained from GC/MS analysis (peak integration) were processed according to previous publications [ 60, 61, 62, 63].
2: This evaluation results in the molar excess of carbon isotopologues of the main components camphor and 1,8-cineole only due to the enrichments from the  13C precursor.
