0: The measurements were performed as follows: the injector and interface temperature were 230 C and 250 C respectively.
1: The temperature settings of the oven were: 70 C for 2 min, then 7090 C with 2 C/min, then 90130 C with 5 C/min and finally 250 C for 1 min.
2: The pressure program started at 76.1 kPa with a linear velocity of 40.0 cm/s.
3: The flow control was set to linear velocity.
4: The total flow was 16.1 mL/min while the column flow stayed at 1.19 mL/min.
5: The split ratio was 1:10.
6: The detector volts were approx.
7: 0.8 keV (according to the last tuning result of the MS).
8: The solvent cut was adjusted at 4 min and the sampling rate at 0.15 s. The micro scan width was fixed at 0.1 u.
