0: Spike lavender ( Lavandula latifolia Medicus) is an aromatic shrub of high economic importance due to its essential oil, composed mainly of monoterpenes [ 22].
1: The main constituents in spike lavender oil from flowers are the monoterpenes linalool, cineole and camphor, while the main constituents in the oil from leaves are cineole and camphor [ 23].
2: All monoterpenes are derived from geranyl diphosphate molecule (GPP).
3: In the case of camphor, GPP is transformed via cyclisation of linaloyl pyrophosphate into bornyl pyrophosphate, followed by a hydrolysis reaction that produces borneol, which finally is oxidized to camphor.
4: In the case of cineole, the GPP intermediate is first converted into -terpineol by the -terpineol synthase and this monoterpene is converted into cineole by the cineole synthase [ 24] ( Figure 2).
