0: The use of  13CO 2 as a tracer is a powerful tool, since this strategy represents the possibility of studying metabolic pathways in plants by mimicking, as much as possible, their physiological growth conditions [ 40, 41, 42].
1: The labelling period (pulse) is followed by a chase period in which the plants grow under normal conditions and natural  13CO 2 abundance for several hours/days.
2: During that time, unlabeled products and intermediates are produced, that also are used in the production of the final metabolites.
3: Therefore, complex patterns of [ 12C]- and [ 13C]-isotopologues are expected to be found in the final natural products.
4: The analysis of complex isotopologue mixtures in  13CO 2-labelled natural products became possible recently, because of the remarkable improvement made in NMR and mass spectrometry techniques [ 40, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46].
5: 13CO 2 feeding has also been used to measure plastidic DMAPP concentrations and to quantify the  de novo production of volatile and nonvolatile isoprenoids in some species [ 47].
6: In this paper, we describe the  13CO 2 labelling conditions necessary to study the incorporation of  13CO 2 into cineole and camphor in wild type (WT) and HMGR5 transgenic spike lavender plants.
7: The results are aimed to clarify the possible contribution of the MVA pathway to the biosynthesis of both monoterpenes in the species.
