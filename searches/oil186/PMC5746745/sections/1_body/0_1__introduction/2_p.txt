0: All terpenes originate from the universal C5 precursor IPP and its isomer DMAPP.
1: In plants, both compounds are formed through two pathways [ 10, 11]: the cytosolic MVA pathway, which comprises several enzymatic reactions from acetyl coenzymeA condensation through mevalonate iphosphate decarboxylation, and the plastidial MEP pathway starting from the reaction between pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate ( Figure 1).
