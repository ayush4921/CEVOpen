0: The MVA pathway is primarily regulated at the level of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (HMGR) [ 1, 12], and it is known that HMGR activity regulates the metabolic flux through the MVA pathway and the eventual production of the isoprenoid end-products [ 13, 14].
1: The scenario seems to be more complex in the case of the MEP pathway.
2: In fact, the MEP pathway can be regulated by several enzymes, including 1-deoxy- d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) synthase (DXS), DXP reductoisomerase (DXR) [ 15] and hydroxymethyl-butenyl 4-diphosphate (HMBPP) reductase (HDR) [ 13, 15, 16].
