0: The incorporation of  13C- or  14C-labelled tracer compounds into the current metabolism is one of the most powerful tools to determine the metabolites biosynthetic pathways.
1: To study primary and secondary metabolism in plants, general precursors (e.g., glucose) or more specific intermediates can be used as tracers and supplied to plant tissues maintained either in vitro (e.g., plant cell cultures, stem or leave cultures, seedlings) [ 38, 39] or ex vitro [ 39].
2: By studying the presence and distribution of the labelled atoms in the final products, it is possible to reconstruct the metabolic pathways followed [ 39].
