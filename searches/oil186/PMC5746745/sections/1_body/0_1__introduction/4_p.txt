0: Generally, it is assumed that the MVA pathway is responsible for providing precursors for the synthesis of sesquiterpenes and triterpenes, while the MEP pathway donates precursors for monoterpenes, diterpenes and tetraterpenes [ 17].
1: Although both pathways are thought to operate independently under normal conditions, interactions between them have been repeatedly reported [ 18].
2: Thus, experiments with labelled products and/or treatments with specific inhibitors (mevinoline and fosmidomycin that respectively block the MVA and MEP pathways) illustrate that the compartmental division between the two pathways is not complete since common metabolites from both pathways can be exchanged, in both directions, through the plastidial membrane [ 11, 19, 20].
3: Therefore, the relative contribution of the MVA and MEP pathways for the biosynthesis of plant terpenes and the factors controlling this distribution especially under physiological conditions of growing plants remain uncertain for each plant species.
4: It is still assumed, however, that monoterpenes are primarily synthesized in the plastids via the MEP pathway-derived IPP and DMAPP [ 21].
