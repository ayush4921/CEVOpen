0: Identification of the oil components was based on their retention indices, determined by the reference to a homologous series of  n-alkanes, and by a comparison of their mass spectral fragmentation patterns with those reported in the literature [ 19] and stored on the MS library (NIST database (Version G1036A, Revision D.01.00, US Department of Commerce, Gaithersburg, MD, USA)/ChemStation data system (Version G1701CA, Revision C.00.01.080, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA)).
1: The percentages of each component are reported as raw percentages, based on total ion current without standardization.
