0: The samples were also subjected to screening in order to identify their possible antioxidant activity, by using a 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl free radical (DPPH) scavenging assay [ 21].
1: Free radical scavenging activity of the corresponding samples was dependent on the extent of bleaching of the purple-colored DPPH methanol solution.
2: Aliquots (50 L) of various concentrations (0.53.0 mg/mL) of the samples in methanol were added to 5 mL of 0.004% DPPH solution in methanol (5 mL).
3: Following a 30-min incubation period at room temperature, the absorbance was recorded against a blank at 517 nm.
4: Inhibition of DPPH in percentage (I%) was calculated using the following formula:  (1)IDPPH%=(1A0Ax)100 where  A0 is the absorbance of the control reaction (containing all reagents except the test compound), and  A  x is the absorbance of the test sample.
5: The median inhibitory concentration (IC 50) was calculated from the plot of inhibition percentage, against sample concentration.
6: Tests were carried out in triplicate.
