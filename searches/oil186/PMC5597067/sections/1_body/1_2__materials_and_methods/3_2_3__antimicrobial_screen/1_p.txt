0: The essential oils were screened for antibacterial activity against: Gram-positive bacteria,  Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC No.
1: 29213),  Bacillus cereus (ATCC No.
2: 14579); Gram-negative bacteria  Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC No.
3: 27853),  Serratia marcescens (ATCC No.
4: 14756).
5: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined by using the microbroth dilution technique [ 20].
6: Dilutions of the essential oil were prepared in cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton broth (CAMHB), beginning with 50 L of 1%  w/ w solutions of essential oil in DMSO, plus 50 L CAMHB.
7: The extract solutions were serially diluted (1:1) in CAMHB, in 96-well plates.
8: Organisms at a concentration of approximately 1.5  10 8 colony forming units (CFU)/mL were added to each well.
9: Plates were incubated at 37 C for 24 h; the final minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined as the lowest concentration without turbidity.
10: Gentamycin was used as a positive antibiotic control; DMSO was used as a negative control.
11: Antifungal activity against  Candida albicans (ATCC No.
12: 10231) and  Aspergillus niger (ATCC No.
13: 16888) was determined as above, using Yeast and Mold Broth (YMB) inoculated with the corresponding fungal culture, diluted to a McFarland turbidity of 1.0.
14: Amphotericin B was the positive control [ 18].
