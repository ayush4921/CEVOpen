0: This work presents two innovative isolation techniques for directly separating the essential oils from the juices of fingered citron.
1: It is important to note that both of the methodologies proposed here do not represent conventional solid-water mixing distillation of essential oils, but a new separation method of the concentrated upper layer of fruit juice.
2: One is a short-time vacuum distillation, and the other is ultrafiltration.
3: The data reported in this work were obtained by comparing the chemical compositions and bioactivities of fingered citron oils using the new methods, with those of the oils obtained by conventional methods such as hydrodistillation and organic solvent extraction.
4: The purpose of this research is to obtain a high-quality, commercially applicable fingered citron oil, that can maintain the pure distinctiveness of fingered citron.
5: It is very likely that improving the quality of fingered citron oil, as well as reducing the processing cost, would significantly improve local agricultural production.
