0: Unlike other citrus fruits such as lemon and grapefruit, mature fingered citron has only a thin yellow exocarp and thick white entoderm, without juicy pulp or seeds [ 2].
1: This peculiar anatomical structure, results in a low proportion of exocarp containing essential oil.
2: Therefore, the total yield of a complete fruit is typically in the range of 0.7%1.2% ( w/ w), as stated in previously published work [ 8, 9].
3: Furthermore, the oil-water state is sometimes impossible to separate, depending on single-circle hydrodistillation, due to the emulsification of a much lower essential oil content into a relatively large amount of water.
4: Therefore, a conventional isolation process for producing essential oil from these fruits usually employs hydrodistillation using condensed fluid, repeatedly returning to the evaporator-like Clevenger apparatus.
5: However, for a practical large-scale production of essential oil, the cost of isolating the essential oil needs to be considered, and the essential oil could be combined with other procedures, such as beverage production.
6: Much research has focused on oil separation following the cold-pressing of citrus fruits, with pulp such as the common orange [ 10], but few investigations have pursued using fingered citrons, which have no pulp.
