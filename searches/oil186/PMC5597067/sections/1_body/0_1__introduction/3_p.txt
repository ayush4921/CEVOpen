0: The quality of essential oils produced from fingered citron is highly dependent on its chemical composition, as well as associated bioactivities [ 11].
1: During the course of processing the peels of mature fruits, different isolation techniques can not only result in different oil yields, but can also have noticeable effects on chemical composition and other related oil qualities [ 12, 13].
2: Therefore, owing to potential commercial applications, there have been several investigations that have attempted to demonstrate the composition and stability of characteristic aromas, and to determine possible bioactivities, such as those which are antimicrobial or antioxidant [ 14, 15].
3: The GC-MS analysis of oils from Japanese fingered citron showed that -ionone, one of the aroma components with a very low odor threshold (7 ng/L), was responsible for the characteristic osmanthus-like aroma of the fruit [ 16].
4: However, more recent studies have determined the characteristic aromatic components of essential oils from the Jinhua district of China, the results of which, using gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O), have demonstrated that -pinene and -bergamotene were the principal contributors to the characteristic aroma of fingered citron oil [ 17].
5: In addition, as a traditional Chinese medicinal plant, fingered citron has usually been employed as a stomachic carminative, asthma expectorant, and anxiolytic [ 1, 9].
6: Although an increasing number of oil bioactivities, including hypotensive and hypolipidemic effects, have been confirmed [ 5], there have been no reports on the effects of isolation procedures on the chemical composition and bioactivities.
