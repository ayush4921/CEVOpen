0: From the earliest times, medicinal plants have been widely used as natural drugs in the treatment, curing and prevention of disease [ 1].
1: Among these are bacterial diseases [ 2 4].
2: While facing increasing bacterial resistance against routinely used traditional and synthetic antibiotics for the treatment of microbial diseases [ 5 7], we find that research in plant-based natural products to elucidate new therapies from novel antibacterial agents has grown significantly [ 8,  9].
3: Studies report that certain natural antibacterials, when given with standard antibiotics, are even more effective in synergy than the standard drug alone [ 10 12].
4: In the cells of resistant pathogens, these naturally occurring molecules supposedly reach different targets than the known antibiotics do.
