0: Essential oils were analyzed by Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) and Gas Chromatography with a Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID).
1: The same chromatographic conditions were used for GC-MS (Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010-Plus) and GC-FID (GC-20100FI) analysis.
2: The oil was analyzed using an RTx-5 infused-silica capillary column (30 m  0,25 mm i.d., 0.25 m film thickness); the splitless injection used an injector temperature of 220 C, and the column was programmed to run from 60 to 240 C at 3 C/min and held isothermal for 7 min.
3: The flow rate was 1.0 mL min 1, and helium and hydrogen (H 2) were used as the gas carriers for the GC-MS and GC-FID analyses, respectively.
4: The interface temperature of the GC-MS was 240 C and mass spectra were recorded from 30 to 450  m/z, at a scan interval of 0.5 s and an electron impact ionization voltage of 70 eV.
5: Individual components were identified by comparing the acquired mass spectrum with reference data using the Wiley L-Built library and by comparing their retention indices with a commercially available database (NIST 2.0) and the indices described by [ 31].
6: Additional identification was obtained by using a compounds experimental Kovats retention index (RI), as calculated from a C9-C24  n-alkanes series.
