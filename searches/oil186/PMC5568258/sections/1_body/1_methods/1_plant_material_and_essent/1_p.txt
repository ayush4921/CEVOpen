0: Leaves of  M. urundeuva were collected from ten (10) specimens grown in the Nucleo de Pesquisa em Agricultura Urbana (NEPAU), Department of Plant Science, Ceara Federal University (UFC), Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.
1: The leaves were collected with the aid of pruning shears at four different points in the tree canopy and then were mixed in paper bags to form composite samples.
2: After being cut and mixed, they were packed in a drying oven at 75 C. The dry weight of the collected plant material was 100 kg.
3: The voucher specimen (No.
4: 48904) was deposited at the Prisco Bezerra Herbarium of the Department of Biology, Ceara Federal University.
5: To extract the essential oil,  M. urundeuva leaves were hydrodistilled in a Clevenger-type apparatus, as adapted by Gottlieb [ 30].
6: In this process, fresh  M. urundeuva leaves were placed in a 5 L flask, into which 2 L of distilled water were added and the system was boiled for 2 h, until it reached 80 C, to afford yellowish oils by steam stripping.
7: These were dried over Na 2SO 4, stored in sealed glass vials, and preserved under refrigeration before analysis.
8: The yield of the oils (0.02%  w/w) was calculated from the fresh weight of the plant materials.
9: The oily extract, weighed on a precision scale, revealed a concentration of 0.9 g/mL.
