0: To determine the MIC, 20 L of CTT (2,3,5-triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride) 0.5% solution was applied to each well to reveal bacterial growth.
1: The MIC readings were performed after incubation at 37 C for a further 2 h and were defined as the lowest concentrations of essential oil visually inhibiting microbial growth [ 33].
