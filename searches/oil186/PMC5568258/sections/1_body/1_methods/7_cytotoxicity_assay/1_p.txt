0: Having shown antibacterial activity,  Myracrodruon urundeuva essential oil was evaluated for its cytotoxicity to Vero E6 (renal epithelial  Cercopithecus aethiops), HeLa (human cervical adenocarcinoma) and HEK-293 (human kidney embryonic) cell lines obtained from the Culture Collection of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, and cultured in Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 1% antibiotic (penicillin/streptomycin).
1: The cells were maintained in an incubator at 37 C in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2.
2: To assess the viability and proliferation rate of the cell lines in the presence of the oil, a colorimetric assay based on the tetrazolium salt MTT (3- (4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) was performed as described by Mosmann (1983) [ 34].
3: This technique evaluates the metabolic activity of the cells by quantifying the MTT reduction by NADPH and NADH-associated dehydrogenases that results in the production of formazan crystals within the cells, giving the characteristic coloration to the medium.
4: For this study, cells were placed in 96 well plates with a density of 5  10 3 cells/well.
5: After 24 h under the culture conditions, serum deprivation was performed, and, after another 24 h, we applied  M. urundeuva essential oil at concentrations of 0.275 mg/mL, 0.55 mg/mL, 1.1 mg/mL, 2.2 mg/mL and 4.4 mg/mL to the cell strains.
6: After the cells were treated for 24 h or 48 h, 100 L/well of MTT (5 mg/mL) was added and incubated for 4 h. After this, the medium was removed and 100 L of ethanol was added to each well.
7: The plates were shaken and the absorbance obtained in a microplate reader (Epoch - BioTek Instruments Inc., USA) at 570 nm, using Gen5 Data Analysis version 2.0 software (BioTek Instruments Inc., USA).
8: The growth control consisted only of cell culture in the culture medium.
9: The assays were assessed in triplicate and the cell viability percentage was calculated as follows: 1\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$ CV\%=\left( Abs\ sample/ Abs\ growth control\right)\ x100 $$\end{document}CV%=Abssample/Absgrowth controlx100
