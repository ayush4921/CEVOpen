0: The antibacterial activity of the oil was assessed quantitatively by the broth microdilution technique in 96 well microplates [ 32].
1: The test sample (T) was diluted serially at the following concentrations: 450; 225; 112.5; 56; 28; 14; 7; 3.52; 1.76; 0.88; 0.44; 0.22; 0.11; 0.055; 0.028 and 0.014 mg/mL.
2: The positive control (PC) used serial dilutions of gentamicin (Gentamisan - SANTISA) at a concentration of 0.016 mg/mL or 16 g/mL.
3: As a negative control (NC), an aqueous solution of 5% Tween 80 was used.
4: We then added 20 L of the inoculum solution to each of the wells.
5: In the growth control (GC), only the inoculum was added.
6: The microplate was incubated at 37 C/24 h to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).
7: All tests were performed in triplicate.
