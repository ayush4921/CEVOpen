0: The bactericidal activity of the test oil was measured after reading the MIC by seeding the contents of the micro-titer wells into BHI agar.
1: The most representative wells of the T, PC, NC and GC groups were chosen.
2: From each selected well, 8 L was seeded in specific regions numbered on the back of the Petri dishes, which were then incubated at 37 C. After 24 h of incubation, readings were carried out to determine the bactericidal action of the oil.
3: The MBC was considered the lowest concentration that totally prevented microbial growth in BHI agar.
