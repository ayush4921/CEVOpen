0: Free radicals are involved in the etiology of several degenerative ailments in humans.
1: The unique biological activities of essential oils have been attributed to the mosaic combination of constituents.
2: Studies on  E. foetidum essential oils from diverse geographic climes of the world seem to indicate chemical variability in the proportion and occurrence of aromatic and acyclic aldehydes.
3: A number of researchers have reported ( E)-2-dodecen-1-al as the main constituent of  E. foetidum leaf oil from Malaysia, Bangladesh and Vietnam, but low amount in the Cuban oil [ 2, 7, 8, 9, 10].
4: Martins et al.
5: [ 5] showed the leaf oil of  E. foetidum comprise of 2,3,6-trimethylbezaldehyde (5.5%23.7%), ( E)-2-dodecenal (15.9%37.5%) and ( E)-2-tetradecenal (18.7%25.3%) while the Columbian sample predominated in ( E)-2-dodecenal, 5-dodecene, tetradecanal, tetradecenal, 2,3,5-trimethylbenzaldehyde and trimethylphenol [ 6].
6: In addition, a number of  Eryngium species have been investigated for their essential oil composition, such as  E. tricuspidatum,  E. bungei,  E. duriaei,  E. billardieri,  E. caeruleum and  E. corniculatum [ 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].
