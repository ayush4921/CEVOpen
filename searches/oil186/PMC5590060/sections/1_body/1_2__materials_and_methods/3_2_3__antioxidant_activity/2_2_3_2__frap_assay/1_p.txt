0: The reducing power of the essential oils was determined according to the method of Oyaizu [ 21].
1: Various concentrations (20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 g/mL) of essential oils and ascorbic acid were mixed with phosphate buffer (2.5 mL, 0.2 M, pH 6.6) and 1% ( w/ v) of potassium ferricyanide water solution (2.5 mL).
2: The mixture was incubated at 50 C for 20 min.
3: Aliquots of trichloroacetic acid (2.5 mL, 10%, aqueous solution ( w/ v)) were added to the mixture and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min.
4: The supernatant (2.5 mL) was mixed with distilled water (2.5 mL) and a freshly prepared ferric chloride solution (0.5 mL, 0.1% ( w/ v)).
5: After 30 min of incubation at room temperature in the dark, the absorbance of the solution was measured at 700 nm.
6: The experiment was performed in triplicate and the average absorbance noted for each measurement.
7: Higher absorbance indicates higher reducing power.
8: The ferric-reducing capacity of the essential oils and standard compound were expressed graphically by plotting the absorbance against concentration.
