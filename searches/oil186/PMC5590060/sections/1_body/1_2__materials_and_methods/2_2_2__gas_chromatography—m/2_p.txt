0: The components were identified by comparison of their mass spectra with NIST 1998 library data of the GC-MS system as well as by comparison of their retention indices (RI) with the relevant literature data [ 19].
1: The relative amount of each individual component of the essential oil was expressed as the percentage of the peak area relative to the total peak area.
2: RI value of each component was determined relative to the retention times of a homologous n-alkane series with linear interpolation on the HP-5 ms column.
