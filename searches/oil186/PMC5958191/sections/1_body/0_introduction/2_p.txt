0: The previous studies on the  Moringa genus were mainly concentrated on  M. oleifera (Gilani et al.,  1994; Pal et al.,  1995,  1996; Anwar et al.,  2007; Santos et al.,  2012; Stohs and Hartman,  2015; Goswami et al.,  2016; Leone et al.,  2016; Saini et al.,  2016; Asensi et al.,  2017; Kalappurayil and Joseph,  2017; Mallya et al.,  2017; Mangundayao and Yasurin,  2017) since the species is common in Africa and Asia where the common people are search for nutritional foods in an inexpensive way to meet their demand of food sources (Wangcharoen and Gomolanee,  2011).
1: Recently,  M. peregrina is gaining more attention due to traditional, nutritional, industrial and medicinal values.
2: As this plant has wide range of medicinal uses, it has been screened for various pharmacological activities in the past few decades (Marwah et al.,  2007; Soltan and Zaki,  2009; Koheil et al.,  2011; Dehshahri et al.,  2012; Lalas et al.,  2012; Al-Owaisi et al.,  2014; Moustafa et al.,  2014; Majali et al.,  2015; Safaeian et al.,  2015; Ullah et al.,  2015; Alrayes et al.,  2016; El-Awady et al.,  2016; Azim et al.,  2017; Elabd et al.,  2017; Saleh et al.,  2017).
3: Few active molecules were also isolated, identified and reported for various pharmacological activities.
4: An overview of health applications and salient modes of actions of phytoconstituents from  M. peregrina are illustrated in Figure  1.
5: Recently, Robiansyah et al.
6: ( 2014) reviewed the current status of  M. peregrina on its nutrient content, medicinal properties, phenotypic and genetic variation and conservation status.
7: But there was no much information about traditional medicinal values, pharmacological activities and phytochemistry of this plant.
8: Therefore, the present review is aimed to summarize the up-to-date information on the traditional uses, pharmacological activities and phytochemistry of  M. peregrina.
