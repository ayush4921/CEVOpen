2: To date, 391,000 vascular plants had been identified (Willis and Bachman,  2016).
3: Of these, only about 6% of plants were screened for their biological activity and 15% for their phytoconstituents (Verpoorte,  2000).
4: Among those,  Moringa is one of the most important genuses with outstanding economic importance.
5: This genus is potentially used in traditional medicine, pharmacological screening and chemical constituents identification.
6: The genus  Moringa consist of 13 species viz.,  M. arborea, M. borziana, M. concanensis, M. drouhardii, M. hildebrandtii, M. longituba, M. oleifera, M. ovalifolia, M. peregrina, M. pygmaea, M. rivae, M. ruspoliana, and  M. stenopetala.

12: Moreover, the drink provides added energy in the war field (Jahn,  1996; Fuglie,  2001; Manzoor et al.,  2007).
13: Edible oil with pleasant taste (Ben oil) from the seeds of  Moringa was highly valued by the civilizations of ancient Greek, Roman, and Egyptian for protecting their skin and making perfume.
14: Since the middle and old kingdoms (30002000 BC), the ben oil was used by the Egyptians (Miller and Morris,  1988; ICUN,  2005).
