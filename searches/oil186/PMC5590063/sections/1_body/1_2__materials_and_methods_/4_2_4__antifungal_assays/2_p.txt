0: The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the essential oils were determined through the microdilution technique.
1: Firstly, 100 L of Sabouraud dextrose broth (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were taken into the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate.
2: The first well of each row was used as a sterility control and contained only culture medium.
3: Next, 100 L of the emulsion of oil emulsion (80 L/mL) were placed in the second well of a row and two-fold serial dilution was then performed until a concentration of 0.04 L/mL was reached.
4: In each well, aliquots of 10 L of the microorganism inoculum were dispensed.
5: In parallel, a negative control containing only microorganism and medium was run to assure the viability of the yeast strains.
6: It was also performed a positive control using the antifungal fluconazole (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).
7: Assays were performed in triplicate and plates were incubated at 30 C for 48 h. After this period, 10 L of the dye 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (0.5%,  w/ v) was added in each well to detect bacterial growth.
8: The MIC was defined as the lowest oil concentration that promoted inhibition of yeast growth.
