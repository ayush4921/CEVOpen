0: Strains of  C. tropicalis (URM-6741),  C. krusei (URM-6391),  C. albicans (URM-6543),  C. parapsilosis (URM-6557), and  C. glabrata (URM-6393) were obtained from the University Recife Mycologia (URM) from the  Departamento de Micologia of  Universidade Federal de Pernambuco.
1: The yeasts were grown overnight at 30 C in Petri plates containing Sabouraud dextrose agar (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and inocula for use in the assays were prepared by diluting scraped cell mass in 0.85% NaCl, adjusting to 0.5 in McFarland.
2: Cell suspensions were finally diluted to 10 6 CFU/mL for use in the assays.
