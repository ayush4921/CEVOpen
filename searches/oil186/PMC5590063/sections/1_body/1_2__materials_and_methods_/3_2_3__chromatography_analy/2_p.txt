0: The identification of the compounds present in the oils was performed by GC coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
1: These analyses were carried out using an Agilent 5975C Series GC/MSD (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) quadrupole instrument equipped with an Agilent J&W non-polar DB-5 fused silica capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm i.d.
2: ; film thickness: 0.25 m) (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA).
3: For each sample, 1 L was injected in split mode (50:1) with the injector temperature set to 250 C. GC oven temperature was set to 40 C, was held for 2 min, was increased to 230 C at 4 C/min, and was then held for 5 min.
4: Helium (He) was used as a carrier gas at a flow of 1 mL/min, maintained at a constant pressure of 7.0 psi.
5: MS Source and quadrupole temperatures were set to 230 C and 150 C, respectively.
6: Mass spectra were taken at 70 eV (in EI mode) with a scanning speed of 1.0 scans from  m/ z 35350.
7: The identification of the individual components was carried out by comparison with previously reported values of retention indices, obtained by co-injection of oil samples and a set of C 9C 30 linear hydrocarbons, and calculated according to the equation of Van den Dool and Kratz [ 18].
8: Subsequently, the MS data acquired for each component were matched with the data available in the mass spectral library of the GC-MS system (MassFinder 4, Dr. Hochmuth scientific consulting, Hamburg, Germany); NIST08 Mass Spectral Library (ChemSW Inc. Fairfield, CA, USA); Wiley RegistryTM of Mass Spectral Data 9th Edition (Wiley, Hoboken, NJ, USA) and with other published mass spectral data [ 19].
9: Analyses were carried out in triplicate.
