0: Gas chromatography (GC) analyses were performed in order to determine the relative proportions of the components of the oils.
1: GC analyses were carried on a Thermo TraceGC Ultra (Thermo Scientific, Milan, Italy) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) (Thermo Scientific, Milan, Italy) and a VB-5 fused silica capillary column (ValcoBond 30 m  0.25 mm i.d.
2: ; film thickness: 0.25 mm) (Valco Instruments Company Inc. , Houston, TX, USA).
3: Nitrogen was employed as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 L/min and 30 psi inlet pressure.
4: The oven temperature program was initially 40 C, was held for 2 min, was increased to 230 C at 4 C/min, and was then held for 5 min.
5: The injector and detector temperatures were set to 250 C and 280 C, respectively.
6: The sample (1 L; 2 mg/mL in n-hexane) was injected splitless.
7: The relative amount of each component was estimated from the corresponding peak area and expressed as a percentage of the total area of the chromatogram.
8: Analyses were carried out in triplicate.
