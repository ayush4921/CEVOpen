0: On the other hand, the intensive use of synthetic insecticides in mosquito control programs has created resistance in the insect population [ 5], undesirable effects on other insects [ 6] and negative impacts on the environment [ 7].
1: Although the use of insecticide is the main method in the global effort for mosquito control [ 8], vector-borne diseases are persistent due to mosquitoes resistant to traditionally used insecticides [ 9] and lack of effective vaccines [ 10].
2: The resistance of mosquitoes to synthetic insecticides has led to an interest in natural products with potential insecticidal activity, especially those derived from plants, which are considered valid alternatives to conventional synthetic pesticides to control a variety of insect pests and vectors.
3: In this context, the essential oils and their constituents have received much attention as potentially useful bioactive compounds against insects [ 11].
4: The complex and variable mixtures of bioactive compounds with different modes of action, offered by plants, may lessen the chance of resistance in mosquito populations [ 12].
