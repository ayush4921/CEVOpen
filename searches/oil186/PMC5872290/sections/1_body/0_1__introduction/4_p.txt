0: Essential oils are heterogeneous mixtures of organic chemical compounds from different chemical families [ 13]; many have a terpenoid backbone, especially monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes.
1: Low molecular weight aliphatic compounds, acyclic esters or lactones may also be present [ 14].
2: Chemical composition of essential oils is affected by factors such as plant species and subspecies, geographical location, harvest time, part of the plant used and the extraction methods used to obtain the essential oil [ 15].
3: Several studies have reported the larvicidal action of medicinal plants and their essential oils against insect vectors of  Culex and  Anopheles genera, as well as  Aedes aegypti (L.) [ 16, 17].
4: Furthermore, there are many secondary metabolites found in most of those plants that are considered to have insecticidal properties [ 18, 19].
