0: Twenty-five larvae (third instar) were put into a 500-mL glass bowl containing 200 mL drinking water.
1: Upon acclimatization (after approximately 1 h), a dose of essential oil or pure components was mixed to the water, corresponding to the calculated dose LC 50.
2: The essential oils and pure compounds were emulsified using DMSO; water with an adequate DMSO content was used for the control larvae.
3: Larval mortality was observed 24 h following termination of exposure, during which time, no food was offered to the larvae.
4: Five replicates were run simultaneously.
