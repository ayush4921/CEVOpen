0: A modified Schilcher apparatus was used for hydrodistillation; 200 g of plant material (dried and chopped) was added to 4 L of water and introduced into the boiling flask and the system was heated at 100 C for 5 h [ 21, 22]; for Mexican lime essential oil, 400 g of fresh lime bagasse and 4 L of water were used and the system was heated at 100 C for 4 h (Aldana et al.
1: 2014 [ 23]); the essential oil extracted was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and stored at 4 C in amber glass vials.
2: For chemical analysis, conditions were similar to those reported by Aldana et al.
3: [ 23] for gas chromatographic separation followed by mass spectrometry.
4: Analysis were done in a Perkin Elmer AUTOSYSTEM XL Gas Chromatograph (Waltham, MA, USA) and TurboMass Gold Spectrometer (Hewlett-Packard In., Palo Alto, CA, USA).
