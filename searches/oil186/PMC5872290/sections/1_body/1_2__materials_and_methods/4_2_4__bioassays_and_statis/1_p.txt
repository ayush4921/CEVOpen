0: Mosquito larvicidal assays were carried out according to standard World Health Organization (WHO) larvicidal assay method with slight modifications [ 24].
1: The essential oils and the binary mixtures of the most effective essential oils (i.e., the oils which achieved the lowest LC 50 values on  C. quinquefasciatus larvae) were diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma-Aldrich, San Louis, MI, USA) preparing a serial dilution of test dosages.
2: For each experimental treatment, 1 mL of serial dilution was added to 224 mL of distilled water in a 500-mL glass bowl and shaken lightly to ensure a homogenous test solution.
3: The selected larvae were transferred in distilled water into a bowl of prepared test solution with final surface area of 125 cm 2 (25 larvae/beaker) and maintained in starvation throughout the experimental period; the surviving larvae were counted to record larval mortality.
4: Five replicates were run simultaneously with at least 10 dosages (300, 200, 100, 75, 50, 25, 15, 10, 5, and 2.5 g/mL).
5: The larvicidal activity of DMSO was also determined under the same conditions; a DMSO concentration of 1000 g/mL had no larvicidal activity.
6: The lethal concentrations (LC 50 and LC 90) were calculated using Probit analysis.
7: Data were processed using MS Excel 2010 (Microsoft, WA, USA) and SAS v.9 (Proc Probit) (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, USA) computer programs.
