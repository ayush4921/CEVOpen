0: The oviposition deterrent test was done using the method described by Xue et al.
1: [ 25].
2: The percent of effective repellency for was calculated using the formula: ER (%) = ((  NC    NT)/(  NC +   NT)  100  (1) where  ER is the percent of effective repellency;  NC is the number of eggs in the control sample; and  NT is the number of eggs in treatment bowl.
3: ER was determined and transformed to arcsine square root values for analysis of variance.
