0: The effects of mixtures were designated as either antagonistic, additive, or synergistic by analysis using  x2 comparisons: x2 = (  O   m    E)  2/  E(3) where O m is the observed mortality from the binary mixture and E is the expected mortality,  x2 with  df  = 1, and  p = 0.05 is 3.84.
1: A pair with  x2 values > 3.84 and having greater than expected mortality were considered to be synergistic (or antagonistic), with  x2 values< 3.84 representing additive effects [ 19, 27].
