0: Actual mortalities were compared to expected mortalities based on the formula:  E =   O   a +   O   b (1    O   a/100)  (2) where  E is the expected mortality and  O  a and  O  b are the observed mortalities of pure compounds at the given concentration.
1: The factor of 100 was used to calculate the value of  E.
