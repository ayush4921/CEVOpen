0: Analysis by GC-MS: Kaffir lime oil and its fractions was analyzed by using a GC-MS Shimadzu type (QP 2010s) with bombardier electron system of 70 eV in voltage, injector temperature was at 280C, detector temperature at 320C, pressure foreline: 4 Pa, and the mass range of 30-425 amu).
1: HP-5 (Hewlett Packard-5) capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 pM) was used.
2: Gas flow rate on helium carrier was 1 mL/min and the column temperature was programmed as follows: initial temperature 80C was maintained for 10 minutes, then the temperature was increased from 80C to 300C with the increase rate of 4C/minute.
3: Then the chromatogram was formed.
