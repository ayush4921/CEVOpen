0: Material and instrument: The kaffir lime oil sample was obtained from Ngunut, Tulungagung, East Java.
1: Fractional distillation: PiloDist 104-VTU, length = 2 m, and number of stages = 120 (bait 1-2 L).
2: GC-MS spectrometer instrumentation merck Shimadzu QP-type 2010s, RTX-5MS column.
3: Fractional distillation: Fractional distillation was performed on lime oil (2 L) by using a PiloDist 104-VTU under reduced pressure, length = 2 m, number of stages = 120, and the conditions were monitored by using a computer.
4: Heating jacket coat were used as a heat source.
5: Fractional distillation was performed repeatedly with varied reflux ratio of 10/10, 20/10 and 60/10, with 0 mbar, 5 mbar and 10 mbar pressure variation.
6: Each fraction is collected and its volume was measured.
7: The fractional distillation was done in Laboratory of Chemistry, LIPI Serpong, Tangerang, West Java.
