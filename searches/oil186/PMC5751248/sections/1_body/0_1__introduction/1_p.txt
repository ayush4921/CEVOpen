0: In the last few years, the emergence and growing accessibility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have allowed advances in the understanding of the composition and functional activity of the gut microbial community.
1: Approximately 100 papers on gut microbiota were published in 2007, whereas about 3000 such studies were published in 2016, and almost the same number to date in 2017 (research performed by setting the words gut and microbiota in October 2017 on PubMed and Scopus).
2: The importance of using NGS technology is due to the necessity of simultaneous analysis of a large amount of genetic material.
3: Indeed, overall, the gut microbiota is estimated to contain 150 times more genes than the human genome.
4: These genes have been estimated to belong to approximately 10 1310 14 microbes, with a species diversity of up to several hundred per individual [ 1].
5: However, The Human Microbiota Project and other studies have collectively found that thousands of different species may inhabit the human gut, pointing out the high degree of taxa variation in the microbiota composition of different populations.
6: Despite this variation, the human gut microbiota is characterized by some basic similarities.
7: Approximately 60% of the gut bacteria belong to the  Bacteroidetes and  Firmicutes phyla, and, among them,  Bifidobacterium,  Lactobacillus,  Bacteroides,  Clostridium,  Escherichia,  Streptococcus, and  Ruminococcus are the most commonly found genera in adults [ 2].
8: However, several factors influence the bacterial composition in taxa type and abundance, making the total gut microbiota profile host-specific in humans.
9: These factors include host phenotype, such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), lifestyle, and immune function; geographical belonging and environmental factors; use of antibiotics, drugs, and probiotics; and diet.
