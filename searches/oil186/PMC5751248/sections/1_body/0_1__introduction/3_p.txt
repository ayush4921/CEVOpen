0: Among the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6) are the two main bioactive forms in humans.
1: These fatty acids can be synthesized from the dietary precursor and essential fatty acid, -linolenic acid (ALA, C18:3).
2: However, the synthesis pathway requires several elongation and desaturation chemical reactions, so that the conversion of the two active forms in mammals is less efficient than dietary uptake.
3: For this reason, consumption of EPA- and DHA-rich foods is recommended.
4: However, since foods rich in these fatty acids are not widespread, EPA and DHA are widely used as nutritional supplements, often as nutraceuticals.
5: Several papers have demonstrated the correlation between omega-3 PUFAs and the inflammatory response.
6: Although the literature on this topic is discordant, omega-3 PUFAs are generally associated with anti-inflammatory effects, in comparison with the omega-6 PUFAs that are linked to pro-inflammatory effects, due to the different downstream lipid metabolites [ 6].
7: Also, with regards to the link to immunity, studies have shown that the supplementation of omega-3 PUFAs provides multiple health benefits against different chronic degenerative diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases [ 7], rheumatoid arthritis [ 8], inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [ 9], depression [ 10], and cancer [ 11].
