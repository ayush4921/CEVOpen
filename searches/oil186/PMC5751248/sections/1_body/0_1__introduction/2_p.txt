0: The causal relationship between the gut microbiota and overall pathological conditions is still unclear.
1: Indeed, it is still unclear whether a disease-prone microbial composition exists (so-called dysbiosis) or whether the changes in the microbial community occur after the onset of the disease [ 3].
2: Conversely, diet undoubtedly influences the composition of gut microbiota, providing nutrients for both the host and the bacteria.
3: This gut community has many degrading enzymes and metabolic capabilities that are able to break down macromolecules into smaller chemical compounds, which can then be uptaken by enterocytes [ 4].
4: Moreover, long-term dietary habits have been shown to play a crucial role in creating an inter-individual variation in microbiota composition [ 5].
5: However, despite the great number of publications on the effects of carbohydrates, the impacts of dietary fats and protein on the gut microbiota are less well defined.
6: In particular, gut microbiota changes associated with omega-3 fatty acids are poorly understood.
