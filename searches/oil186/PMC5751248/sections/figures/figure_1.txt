0:  Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) potential action in restoring eubiosis in gut microbiota.
1: Dysbiosis of the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio is associated with several conditions, such as weight gain and obesity [ 56], insulin resistance [ 56], high-fat diet [ 38, 39], gut permeability [ 54], IBDs [ 21], and depression [ 88].
2: Similarly, a Bifidobacteria decrease combined with a Enterobacteria increase leads to the establishment of endotoxemia that causes a chronic low-grade inflammation associated with some pathological conditions, like insulin resistance [ 46], gut permeability [ 43, 44], and depression [ 92].
3: Initial evidence shows that omega-3 PUFAs are able to reverse this condition by restoring the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, and increasing Lachnospiraceae taxa [ 13, 16, 18, 19, 20], both associated with an increased production of the anti-inflammatory short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) butyrate [ 13, 19, 20].
4: Moreover, animal studies showed the ability of omega-3 PUFAs to increase lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-suppressing bacteria, Bifidobacteria, and to decrease LPS-producing bacteria, Enterobacteria, negating the endotoxemia phenomenon [ 52].
5: For all these actions, omega-3 PUFAs can be considered as prebiotics, able to restore gut eubiosis in some pathological conditions. )
