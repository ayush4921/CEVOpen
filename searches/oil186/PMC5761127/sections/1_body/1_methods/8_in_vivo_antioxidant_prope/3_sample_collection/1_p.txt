0: Serum was prepared by centrifugation (1500 g, 15 min, 4 C; Beckman-Coulter, Marseille, France) and stored at 80 C for further biochemical assays.
1: The liver and kidney tissues were immediately removed and dissected over ice-cold glass slides and a part was homogenized (10%  w/ v) with an Ultra Turrax homogenizer in ice-cold, 1.15% KCl-0.01 M sodium, potassium phosphate buffer.
2: Homogenates were centrifuged at 10000 g for 20 min at 4 C. The resulting supernatants were used for immediate lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation determination.
3: Homogenate aliquots were stored at 80 C for further biochemical assays.
4: Other parts of these livers and kidney tissues were fixed in 10% formaldehyde solution and processed for paraffin sectioning and histological studies.
