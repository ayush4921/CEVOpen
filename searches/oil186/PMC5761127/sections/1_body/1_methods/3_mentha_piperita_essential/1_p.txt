0: MpEO compositional analysis of the volatile constituents was performed on a Hewlett-Packard gas chromatograph GC: 5890 series II.
1: The fused HP-Innowax capillary column (polyethylene glycol, 30 m, 0.25 m, ID, 0.25 mm film thickness) was directly connected to the mass spectrometer.
2: Nitrogen was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min.
3: Oven temperature was initially set at 50 C (1 min) and gradually raised to 250 C (5 min) at 7 C/min.
4: The temperatures of the injection port and detector were maintained at 250 and 280 C, respectively.
5: The mass spectrometer was operated (full scan-mode) in the EI-mode at 70 eV.
