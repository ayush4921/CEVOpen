0: 2,2-Diphenyl picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radicals scavenging activity was assessed according to Blois [ 17], with a slight modification.
1: Different concentrations of the MpEO and silymarin (5100 g/ml) were mixed with 1 ml of 0.1 mM DPPH in ethanol solution and 450 L of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) was added.
2: The solution was incubated at 37 C for 30 min and the reduction of DPPH free radicals was measured by reading the absorbance at  = 517 nm.
3: Silymarin was used as reference standard.
4: The activity is given as % DPPH scavenging and calculated according to the following equation: \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$ \%\mathrm{DPPH}\ \mathrm{scavenging}=\left[\left(\mathrm{control}\ \mathrm{OD}-\mathrm{sample}\ \mathrm{OD}\right)/\mathrm{control}\ \mathrm{OD}\right]\times 100 $$\end{document}%DPPH scavenging=controlOD-sampleOD/controlOD100
