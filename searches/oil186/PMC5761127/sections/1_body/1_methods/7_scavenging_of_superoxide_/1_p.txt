0: The influence of MpEO on the generation of superoxide anion was measured according to the method described by Yen & Chen, 1995 [ 18].
1: Superoxide anion was generated in a non-enzymatic system and determined by spectrophotometric measurement for the reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium.
2: The reaction mixture, which contained 100 L of essential oil in ethanol, 800 L of 1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 400 L of distilled water, 100 L of 0.1 M Na 4EDTA, 100 L of 1.5 mM NBT and 50 L of 0.12 mM riboflavin was incubated at ambient temperature for 5 min, and the color was read at  = 560 nm against blank samples.
