0: Catalase (CAT) activity was measured according to Aebi [ 26].
1: A total of 20 L tissue homogenate (about 1.5 mg proteins) was added to 1 ml phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7) containing 100 mM H 2O 2.
2: Rate of H 2O 2 decomposition was followed by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 240 nm for 1 min.
3: The enzyme activity was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 0.043 mM 1 cm 1 and expressed in international units (I.U.
4: ), i.e.
5: in mol H 2O 2 destroyed/min/ mg protein, at 25 C.
