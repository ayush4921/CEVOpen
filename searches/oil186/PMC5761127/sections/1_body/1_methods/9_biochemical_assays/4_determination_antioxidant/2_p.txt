0: Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was estimated according to Beyer and Fridovich [ 27].
1: The reaction mixture contained 50 mM of tissue homogenates in potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), 0.1 mM EDTA, 13 mM L-methionine, 2 mM riboflavin and 75 mM nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT).
2: The developed blue color in the reaction was measured at 560 nm.
3: Units of SOD activity were expressed as the amount of enzyme required to inhibit the reduction of NBT by 50% and the activity was expressed as units/mg of protein, at 25 C. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity was measured by the procedure of Flohe and Gunzler [ 28].
4: One milliliter of reaction mixture containing 0.3 ml of phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4), 0.2 ml of 2 mM glutathione (GSH), 0.1 ml of sodium azide (10 mM), 0.1 ml of H 2O 2 (1 mM) and 0.3 ml of liver and kidney supernatant were prepared.
5: After incubation at 37 C for 15 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 0.5 ml 5% TCA.
6: Tubes were centrifuged at 1500g for 10 min and the supernatant was collected.
7: To 0.1 ml of this reaction supernatant, 0.2 ml of (0.1 M pH 7.4) and 0.7 mL of 5,5 dithiobis-(2-Nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB, 0.4 mg/ml) were added.
8: After mixing, absorbance was recorded at 420 nm and the enzyme activity was calculated as mol of GSH oxidized/min/mg protein.
