0: From the experimental and clinical studies performed on  Mentha piperita leaf essential oil (MpEO), it seems that most of its pharmacological actions are due to its antioxidant activity which is mainly due to its ability to scavenge free radicals and/or inhibit lipid peroxidation [ 15,  16].
1: Antioxidants are substances that delay or prevent the oxidation of inter- or intra-cellular oxidizable substrates from oxidative stress.
2: In this study, we report the chemical composition and antioxidant effects of MpEO in several in vitro systems (DPPH and superoxide scavenging activities).
3: Besides, we are interested in determining the possible protective effects of MpEO against oxidative damage of the liver and kidney following an intraperitoneal administration of CCl 4, by assessing the oxidative stress profile and some serum biochemical parameters.
