0: Reactive oxygen species (ROSs) are various forms of activated oxygen.
1: A disproportion of the reactive oxygen species and the absence of their scavenge systems in cells lead to oxidative stress and increases the risk of several human chronic diseases [ 1].
2: ROS contributes to the development of various diseases such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, liver cirrhosis and the aging process [ 2].
3: The liver plays a central role in the maintenance of systemic lipid homeostasis and is especially susceptible to ROS damage.
4: CCl 4 is now of greatest concern as an environmental contaminant [ 3].
5: It was reported that CCl 4 was one of the most commonly used toxins in the experimental study of liver diseases [ 4].
6: Abraham et al.
7: [ 5] showed that the nephrotoxic effects of CCl 4 were also associated with free radical production.
