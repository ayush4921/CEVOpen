0: GC-MS analyses were performed on a Hewlett-Packard 5973-6890 system operating in EI mode (70 eV) equipped with a split/splitless injector (220 C), a split ratio 1/10, using a fused silica HP-5 MS capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm (i.d.
1: ), film thickness: 0.25 m).
2: The temperature program for HP-5 MS column was from 60 C (5 min) to 280 C at a rate of 4 C/min.
3: Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min.
4: Injection volume for all samples, diluted as previously described, was 2 L.
