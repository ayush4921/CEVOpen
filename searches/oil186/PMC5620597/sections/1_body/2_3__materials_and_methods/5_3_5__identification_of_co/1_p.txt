0: Retention indices for all compounds were determined according to the Van der Dool approach [ 32] with reference to a homologous series of normal  n-alkanes from C 9 to C 23.
1: The identification of the components was based on a comparison of their mass spectra with those of Wiley and NBS Libraries and those described by Adams (2007), as well as by comparison of their retention indices with literature data [ 33].
2: Component relative percentages were calculated based on GC-FID peak areas without using correction factors.
