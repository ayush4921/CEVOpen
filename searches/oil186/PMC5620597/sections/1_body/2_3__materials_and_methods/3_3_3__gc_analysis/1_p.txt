0: Quantification was performed using gas-chromatography coupled with flame ionization detection (GC-FID).
1: Analyses were carried out on a Perkin Elmer Clarus 500 gas chromatograph with FID, fitted with a fused silica Rtx-5 MS capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm (i.d.
2: ), film thickness: 0.25 m).
3: The column temperature was programmed from 60 C to 250 C at a rate of 3 C/min.
4: The injector and detector temperatures were programmed at 230 C and 280 C, respectively.
5: 0.5 L of each sample were diluted in 500 L GC grade n-pentane and 2 L of the obtained solution was further injected in the GC apparatus.
6: Identification of constituents was achieved by calculating the arithmetic indices relative to linear alkanes from C 9C 23 and comparing with data from GC-MS identifications.
