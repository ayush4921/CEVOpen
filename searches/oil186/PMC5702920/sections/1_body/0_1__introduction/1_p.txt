0: Species belonging to the  Protium genus (Burseraceae) produce a characteristic fragrant oleoresin with economic, medicinal, and cultural values [ 1,  2].
1: In the Brazilian Amazon region, these oleoresins are known as  breu, breu-branco (white-tar), and  breu-preto (black-tar) [ 3 5].
2: Breu oleoresins are a combination of two fractionsa volatile fraction that is mainly composed of mono- and sesquiterpenes and a solid nonvolatile fraction that is mainly composed of triterpenesand have a complex chemical composition with varying concentrations of each component responsible for  breu therapeutic activities [ 6 9].
3: Despite traditional communities' belief that there is a difference between white and black  breu, we have demonstrated that it is difficult to establish this nomenclature based on chemical, botanical, or regional names [ 5].
4: This traditional classification is probably associated with the darkening of the oleoresin caused by volatilization of select components and/or oxidation of others [ 5].
5: Among the mono and sesquiterpenes that characterize the volatile  breu fractions, some present antimicrobial, antioxidant [ 10], analgesic [ 11], anti-inflammatory, and antitumor [ 12] activities.
6: Because of its high sensorial quality,  breu essential oil is also used as a fragrance in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries [ 13].
