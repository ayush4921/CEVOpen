0: In March 2012, our research group embarked on an expedition to the  quilombola territories along the Erepecuru River (Oriximina, Brazil) in search of different  breu trees and oleoresins to collect, analyze, and understand their use by the  quilombolas.
1: This journey was called The Malungo Expedition [ 5].
2: Quilombola communities (descendants of African slaves) from Oriximina, in the State of Para, Brazil, use  breu in their popular medicine to treat headaches and migraines by burning and inhaling the smoke produced during its combustion [ 14,  15].
3: It can also be used as a nasal decongestant by inhalation for severe colds [ 16,  17] as well as a topical treatment for contusions and inflammation and can be administered as a patch [ 18,  19] for colds, coughs, and bronchitis [ 3].
4: Furthermore,  breu is employed for mystical, spiritual [ 16,  19,  20], and superstitious purposes [ 21] as well as for caulking boats [ 14,  20].
