0: Nebulized air relative compositions were obtained using gas chromatography coupled with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID) using two Agilent 7890 gas chromatographs.
1: Separation was accomplished with a HP-5 fused silica capillary column (30 m  0.32 mm i.d., 0.25  m phase thickness).
2: The operating conditions were as follows: split ratio 1 : 10; injector temperature 250C; carrier gas: hydrogen, 1.5 mL/min, constant flow; column temperature, 60C (no hold), 3C per min to 240C; and detector temperature: 280C.
3: Between each analysis, the system was purged to avoid residual component carry over.
