0: Glycoalcoholic solutions containing 0.1 g/mL  breu essential oil, 10% (w/v) propylene glycol, and ethanol were prepared according to the popular use by the  Quilombola Communities of Oriximina (Para, Brazil) [ 14].
1: According to  quilombola knowledge, it is standard practice to burn and inhale approximately 20 g of  breu oleoresin, with an average yield of 2.5% (w/w) of essential oil, which represents approximately 0.5 g of essential oil/20 g of oleoresin [ 5].
2: Therefore, a dose of 0.5 g of essential oil per 5 mL of the formulation was chosen (0.1 g/mL).
3: The final formulation is described below, and it was prepared as follows: first, propylene glycol was homogenized with part of the ethanol, and, subsequently, essential oil was added under stirring.
4: Finally, ethanol was added until the final volume (5 mL) was reached, and the solution was homogenized and stored in amber glass bottles under refrigeration (4C).
5: Based on previous chemical characterization [ 5], essential oils from 10 different  breu samples ( Table 1) were mixed in equal parts for pharmacological tests, according to the similarity of their chemical compositions (major compounds) as follows: Formulation  A, prepared with 0.125 g of BBIM, BBPIR, BBIR 1, and BBIR 2 essential oils, with  -3-carene as the major compound; Formulation  B, prepared with 0.25 g of BBIR 3 and WBB1 essential oils, with  p-cymene as the major compound; Formulation  C, prepared with 0.25 g of BBTF1 and BBTF2 essential oils, with  p-cymene as the major compound with high concentrations of sesquiterpenes; Formulation  D, prepared with 0.5 g of WBB 2 essential oil , with limonene and  -terpineol as the major compounds; and Formulation  E, prepared with 0.5 g of WBIG essential oil, with  -pinene as the major compound.
