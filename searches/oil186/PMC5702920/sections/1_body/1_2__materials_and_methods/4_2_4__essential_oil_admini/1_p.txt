0: For each pharmacological test, seven groups containing five mice each were assembled.
1: Each group was represented by mice that inhaled the following: nebulized air only (control group); the formulation vehicle without essential oil (vehicle group); and one of the formulations (AE).
2: The inhalation process was carried out in a chamber that was previously developed by our group ( Figure 1) [ 22].
3: The chamber contains a central structure connected to five animal holders ( Figure 1(a), 1) with lids ( Figure 1(a), 2), and nebulized air passes directly and continuously through these animal holders.
4: The central chamber ( Figure 1(a), 3) has an outlet for air collection, known as a sampling port ( Figure 1(a), 9), which has a threaded plastic cap with a septum to avoid air loss during  in vivo tests.
5: First, this chamber was assembled and coupled to the nebulizer cup by means of a silicone hose.
6: Then, 5 mL of the test formulation, prepared as described above, was dispersed in a sufficient volume of purified water to a final volume of 15 mL and placed in the nebulizer cup.
7: Animals were placed into the animal holders; the nebulizer was turned on and the formulation was nebulized into the inhalation chamber and each of the five animal holders simultaneously.
8: The nebulized air was blown into the chamber from the head ( Figure 1(a), 4) to the bottom by a central tube, generating a vortex that optimizes saturation and allows more uniform air distribution to the animals [ 22].
