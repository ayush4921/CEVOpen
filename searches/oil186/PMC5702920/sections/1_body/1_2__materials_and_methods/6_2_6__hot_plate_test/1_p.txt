0: Mice were tested to assess central antinociceptive activity according to the method described by Sahley and Berntson [ 24] and adapted by Matheus et al.
1: [ 25].
2: Initially, all mice were evaluated for the determination of their individual baselines.
3: Mice were placed over the stainless-steel heating plate that was at a temperature of 55  0.1C, and the time that it took for each mouse to remove one hind paw from the surface of the plate was timed.
4: These verifications were taken 60 and 30 minutes before mice underwent inhalation.
5: The baseline of each animal was calculated as the mean of the timed trials.
6: The dwell limit time for each mouse was set at three times the baseline value.
7: Baseline determinations were performed 2 days before the pharmacological test.
8: After 2 days, mice were subjected to inhalation.
9: Five and 30 minutes after the end of the inhalation test, mice were placed on the hot plate under same experimental conditions described above.
10: The time that each mouse took to lift a hind paw was timed and scored for final analysis.
