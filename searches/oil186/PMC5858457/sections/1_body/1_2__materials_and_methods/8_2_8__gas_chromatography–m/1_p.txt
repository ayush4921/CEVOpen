0: Clarus 680 was used in the analysis, which employed a fused silica column, packed with Elite-5MS (5% biphenyl 95% dimethylpolysiloxane, 30 m  0.25 mm ID  250 m df), and the components were separated using helium as carrier gas at a constant flow of 1 mL/min.
1: The injector temperature was set at 260 C during the chromatographic run.
2: One microliter of extract sample was injected into the instrument.
3: The oven temperature was as follows: 60 C (2 min), followed by 300 C at the rate of 10 C min 1 and then 300 C, where it was held for 6 min.
4: The mass detector conditions were: transfer line temperature 240 C, ion source temperature 240 C, and ionization mode electron impact at 70 eV, a scan time 0.2 s, and scan interval of 0.1 seconds.
5: Considering fragments from 40 to 600 Da, the spectrums of the components were compared with the database of spectrum of known components stored in the GC-MS NIST (2008) library (mass spectrometry database).
6: The GC-MS analysis was carried out in the Sophisticated Instrument Facility, (SAIF).Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India.
