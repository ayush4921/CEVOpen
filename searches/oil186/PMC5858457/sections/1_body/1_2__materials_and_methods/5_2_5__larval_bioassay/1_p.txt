0: The larvicidal activity of the plant seed pod crude extracts and seed essential oil were tested as per the method recommended by the World Health Organization [ 33].
1: Twenty-five fourth instar larvae of each species were transferred to separate plastic cups, in 249 mL of water and 1.0 mL of the desired plant extract and essential oils at different concentrations (10, 50, 150, 200, and 250 mg/L).
2: An equal number of controls were set up simultaneously using tap water.
3: Dead larvae were counted 24 h post-treatment, and the percent mortality was reported from the average of three replicates using formula (1).
4: The LC 50 (lethal concentration that kills 50% of the exposed larvae) and LC 90 (lethal concentration that kills 90% of the exposed larvae) values were calculated based on mortality data by using probit analysis according to Abbotts [ 34] formula (2).
5: (1)Percentage of mortality =Number of death larvaeNumber of larvae introduced  100(2)Corrected percentage of mortality = 1  n in T after treatmentn in C after treatment  100 where  n = number of larvae, T = treated, C = control.
