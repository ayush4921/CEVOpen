0: Nature provides several bioactive compounds for the control of mosquitoes, namely plant-derived products, marine algal-derived products, microbial-derived products, and other biological compounds.
1: The use of biological-derived products of plant origin is recommended because they are effective, environmentally friendly, and generally have a low toxicity [ 10].
2: Plant oils have rich sources of secondary bioactive metabolites that can be obtained from the nonwoody parts, particularly leaves and seeds through steam distillation or hydrodistillation.
3: Essential oils are rich in species belonging to Rutaceae, Asteraceae, Umbelliferae, Myrtaceae, and Lamiaceae families [ 11].
4: The plant-derived oils have biological activities, namely antibacterial, antifungal, antifeedant, as well as insecticidal activities [ 12, 13].
5: Plant-based essential oil and crude extract have strong ovicidal activity against mosquito eggs [ 14] and larvicidal activity [ 15, 16, 17].
6: Biotoxicity of neem cake extract shows strong insecticidal activity against mosquitoes [ 18].
7: Many research studies have evaluated the use and efficacy of natural plant products against arthropod pests [ 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22].
8: A previous report showed that  Coriandrum sativum (Apiaceae) essential oil shows strong insecticidal activity against  A. albopictus (larvae LC 50 was 421 ppm and LC 90 was 531 ppm)[ 15].
9: Dhanasekaran et al.
10: [ 23] also reported that actinobacterial extract shows remarkable larvicidal activity against mosquitoes.
11: Cassia fistula L flower ethyl acetate crude extract shows strong pesticidal activity against Lepidopteran pests [ 24].
