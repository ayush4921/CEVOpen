0: Commercial available plant-derived essential oils and secondary metabolites are very effective as for good repellents and their insecticidal agents can be incorporated into integrated vector control approaches [ 30].
1: A. nilotica seed pods are reported to contain saponins, terpenes, and tannins, all of which display antiparasitic activity [ 31].
2: Although  A. nilotica crude extracts have insecticidal activity [ 29, 31], there are no reports of seed pod extracts and seed essential oils being used as mosquito control agents.
3: Therefore, the objective of our study was to investigate the mosquitocidal activity of seed oil and seed pod solvent extracts of  A. nilotica against three important mosquito vectors.
