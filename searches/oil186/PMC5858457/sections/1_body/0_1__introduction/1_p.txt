0: Mosquitoes are vectors of many tropical and subtropical pathogens that may cause severe health problems in countries where they are endemic [ 1].
1: Specifically,  Anopheles species vector malaria worldwide.
2: Aedes aegypti and  Ae.
3: albopictus are primary carriers for viruses that cause dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, chikungunya fever, yellow fever, and Zika [ 2, 3].
4: Culex quinquefasciatus, a vector of lymphatic filariasis, is widely distributed in tropical regions [ 4].
5: Lymphatic filariasis is possibly the most rapidly spreading mosquito vector-borne disease to humans in many part of the world and, worldwide, 146 million people suffer from lymphatic filariasis transmitted by  Cx.
6: quinquefasciatus [ 5].
7: Chemical pyrethroids have been relied upon as the insecticides of choice for mosquito control, due to their low mammalian toxicity and quick knockdown activity.
8: In many parts of the world, mosquito vectors have developed resistance against the synthetic chemical insecticides, thus rendering their use for control in some areas ineffective [ 6, 7, 8, 9].
