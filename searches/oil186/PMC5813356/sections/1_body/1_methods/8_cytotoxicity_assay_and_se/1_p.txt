0: A tetrazolium salt colorimetric method has been used to determine survival of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) as described by Bero et al., 2009, with minor modifications [ 29].
1: The MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay is based on the conversion of MTT into formazan crystals by mitochondrial dehydrogenase in living cells.
2: The solutions of essential oils were prepared in DMSO at 20 mg/ml.
3: The essential oils and compounds were firstly diluted in medium in eight serial threefold dilutions (0.5-100 g/ml, 3 wells/concentration) in 96-well microtiter plate.
4: Secondly, 20 l of diluted solutions were transferred to 180 l of 5 10 3 cells previously incubated during 24 h. Finally, after 72 h of incubation, the medium was replaced by a 10% MTT solution (3 mg/ml in PBS) in fresh medium and after 45 min, the medium was replaced again by 100l of DMSO added to solubilize formed formazan crystals.
5: Absorbance was recorded at 570 and 620 nm on a SpectraMax M2e (Molecular Devices) spectrophotometer.
6: Camptothecin was used as positive control at an initial concentration of 25g/ml.
7: Assays were performed in duplicate to calculate the CC 50.
8: The selectivity index (SI), expressed by the CC 50/IC 50 ratio [ 30], defines the balance between cytotoxicity and anti-leishmanial activity.
9: If the SI value is higher than 10, treatment is considered as safe for the cells (CHO) at the therapeutic concentration [ 31,  32].
