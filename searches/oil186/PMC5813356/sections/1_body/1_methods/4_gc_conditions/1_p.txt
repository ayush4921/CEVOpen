0: Gas chromatography (GC) analyses were carried out with an HP-5890 Series II instrument equipped with HP-WAX and HP-5 capillary columns (30 m0.25 mm, 0.25 m film thickness), working with the following temperature program: 60 C for 10 min, ramp of 5 C/min up to 220 C; injector and detector temperatures 250 C; carrier gas was helium (2 mL/min); detector dual FID; split ratio 1:30; injection of 0.5 L (10 % hexane solution).
1: Gas chromatography-electron impact mass spectroscopy analyses were performed with a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph, equipped with a HP-5 capillary column (30 m0.25 mm; coating thickness 0.25 m) and a Varian Saturn 2000 ion trap mass detector.
2: Analytical conditions were as follows: injector and transfer line temperatures 220 and 240 C, respectively; oven temperature programmed from 60 to 240 C at 3 C/min; carrier gas helium at 1 ml/min; injection of 0.2 L (10 % hexane solution); split ratio 1:30 [ 22 27].
