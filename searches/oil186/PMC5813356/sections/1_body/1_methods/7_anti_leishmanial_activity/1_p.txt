0: The in vitro anti-leishmanial effects of essential oils from the leaves (LEO), stems (SEO) and the aerial parts of  H. tuberculatum (LSEO) were investigated on  Leishmania mexicana mexicana ( L.m.m.)
1: as described by [ 28].
2: The solutions were prepared in DMSO at 20 mg/ml.
3: Parasites in the logarithmic growth phase were seeded in 96-well culture plates.
4: Essential oils and compounds were tested in eight serial threefold dilutions (0.05-100 g/ml, 2 wells/concentration).
5: Amphotericin B was used as positive control with an initial concentration of 1g/ml.
6: The plate was kept at 28C and after 72 h of incubation,  Leishmania viability was calculated by quantification of Alamar Blue fluorescence (10 l diluted two times in PBS/well incubated 4h), using an excitation wavelength of 530 nm and emission one of 590 nm on a SpectraMax M2e (Molecular Devices) spectrophotometer.
7: Assays were performed in triplicate to calculate IC 50.
