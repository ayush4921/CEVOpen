0: The identification of the constituents was based on comparison of retention times with those of reference data or pure compounds based on their LRIs with the series of n-hydrocarbons.
1: Moreover, identification of compounds also used gas chromatography-chemical ionization mass spectrometry, using methanol as the chemical ionizing gas [ 22 27] and computer matching against commercial (NIST 98 and ADAMS) and home-made library mass spectra (built up from pure substances and components of known oils and mass spectra literature data).
2: The identified constituents were quantified by the normalization procedure using FID data.
