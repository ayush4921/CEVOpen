0: Leishmaniasis are parasitic diseases.
1: More than 20  Leishmania species have about 70 natural reservoir hosts and vectors including animals, such as dogs or rodents, and human bodies, and are transmitted by more than 90 sand fly species.
2: These diseases are considered as a serious health concern which are occurring in Africa, Asia, Southern Europe and Latin America.
3: Their prevalence rate was estimated from 900 000 to 1.3 million new cases and from 20 000 to 30 000 deaths annually.
4: The parasite may survive for decades in asymptomatic infected people and can also be transmitted directly from person to person.
5: Many factors can increase leishmaniasis like malnutrition, migration, poor housing, a weak immune system, environmental and climatic changes such as deforestation and temperature variation and lack of financial resources [ 1 3].
6: In the absence of effective and sustainable vaccines, its control is still considered as a major public health problem [ 4].
7: The chemotherapy and the drugs based on pentavalent antimonials as sodium stibugluconate (Pentostam) and meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime) are the current means of treatment [ 5].
8: Therefore, the required long-term treatment, toxicity, grave side-effects, pain, cost, drug resistance associated with treatment failures point out the crucial need for new agents in the treatment of leishmaniasis [ 4,  6].
