0: In modern technologies, it is tried to perform the extraction process more easily and effectively in such a manner of solvent usage, extraction time and temperature could be reduced while the extraction efficiency can be improved economically (Li, Pordesimo, & Weiss,  2004).
1: In the oil extraction process, appropriate pretreatments of seeds before oil extraction is one of the most important and necessary steps to produce a high quality oil with a high efficiency (AzadmardDamirchi, Habibi, Hesari, Nemati, & Fathi,  2010).
2: Therefore, recently some techniques such as extraction with supercritical solvents (Meireles & Angela,  2003), ultrasound (Dolatabadi et al.,  2016; Jalili, Jafari, EmamDjomeh, Malekjani, & Farzaneh,  2017; Lou, Wang, Zhang, & Wang,  2010), microwave pretreatments (Bakhshabadi et al.,  2017), and pulsed electric fields (Zeng, Han, & Zi,  2010) have been investigated.
