0: Black cumin seeds (with 40.4% oil) were cleaned and kept in plastic bags resistant to air and moisture penetration by the time of the experiments.
1: Two pretreatments of microwave with the power of 540 W for 180 s and PEF with 3.25 kV/cm electric field intensity and pulses equals to 30 were applied on seeds.
2: It should be mentioned that to use of Molecular Weight (MW), the samples were located on the particular container of microwave in a row.
3: The microwave power was set on 2,450 MH.
4: In terms of PEF, the samples were put in chamber and distilled water was added on the samples as well.
5: The applied power in chamber was 30 pulse with the width of 20 s. Finally the samples were filtered and dried in 50C.
6: Then, the oil of seeds was extracted by a screw press with 34 rpm rotation.
