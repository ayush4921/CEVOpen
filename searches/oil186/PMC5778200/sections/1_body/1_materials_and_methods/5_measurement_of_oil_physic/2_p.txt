0: The refractive index of oil was detected by a refractometer at a temperature of 25C according to AOCS Cc725 ( 1993).
1: To measure the density of the extracted oil, a pycnometer was used (AOCS Cs 10a25,  1993).
2: Briefly, the weight of empty pycnometer was recorded ( m1),the weight of the pycnometer with distilled water ( m2) as well as the weight of pycnometer with oil ( m3) were measured, then the oil density (kg/m 3) has been calculated through the Equation 2.
3: (2)density=m3m1m2m11000
