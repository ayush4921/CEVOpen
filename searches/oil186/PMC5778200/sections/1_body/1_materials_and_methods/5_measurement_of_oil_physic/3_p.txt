0: For color analysis, the spectrophotometer and AOCS Cc 1392 method ( 1993) was applied.
1: For this purpose, the optical density of the oil was measured at 460, 550, 620, and 670 nm with spectrophotometeric approach and then through Equation 3 and according to the Lovybond yellow color, the color index of oils was determined.
2: (3)Color Index=1.29A460+69.7A550+41.2A62056.4A670
