0: A Gas Chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) device and Adam's method ( 1995) with some modifications have been used to analyze and determine various chemical components which exist in the black cumin seed oil.
1: For this reason, 1 ml of oil was mixed with dry sodium sulfate anhydrous and hexane.
2: The obtained mixture analyzed with the use of the GC/MS device equipped with a (HPSMS, Calabria, Italy) and capillary column (30 m length, 0.25 m diameter and 0.25 m thickness of internal layer).
3: The helium carrier gas flow was 0.8 ml per minute and the fission rate of the samples was 110.
4: The column temperature program was set up from 60 to 260C with a speed of 4/min.
5: The mass spectra were prepared at 70 electron volt and the range of these spectra were 35350 m/z.
6: Determination of oil components was performed as a result of comparing their mass spectrum with spectrum bank and comparing their retention coefficient with the reference values.
7: The retention coefficients were prepared with the use of the retention times of normal alkanes that were injected with the same device and under chromatographic conditions.
8: The relative values of components were computed on the basis of the total peak level by the device software.
