0: We designed experiments to examine whether resin type, dehydration prior to entombment and gut microbiota, influenced decay.
1: To mimic as closely as possible natural entombment of insects in resin flies ( Drosophila melanogaster) were embedded in freshly exuded resin, while alive but unconscious; all flies entombed in resin were stored at room temperature (~23C) for the duration of the experiments.
2: Wollemia nobilis trees were purchased from wollemipine.co.uk and  Pinus sylvestris trees were purchased from Coles Plant Centre in Leicester, UK; fresh resin was collected from cuts on the trunk of each tree.
3: The volume of resin for each experiment was not measured but was approximately equal.
4: Flies were rendered unconscious through brief exposure to freezing temperatures, but importantly fly tissues were not frozen, as evinced by their revival after exposure if they were not quickly entombed.
5: In all treatment groups, the fly is considered to be entrapped when it is stuck to the surface of resin, and entombed when it is entirely covered in resin [ 1].
