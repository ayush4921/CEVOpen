0: The effect of dehydration on decay was investigated using both untreated wild-type flies and antibiotic treated flies ( Fig 1).
1: Three states of dehydration were tested: not dehydrated; dehydrated at 50C for three days while entrapped on the resin surface, but before entombment; and dehydrated isolated from the resin at 50C for three days before entombment.
