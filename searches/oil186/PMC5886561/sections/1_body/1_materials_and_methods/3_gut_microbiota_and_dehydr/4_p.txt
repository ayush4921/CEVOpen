0: Unweighted NMDS cluster analysis with either UniFrac or Jaccard distance measurements completely separates the two treatment groups ( S3 Fig).
1: In particular, there is a significant difference in alpha diversity ( S5 Fig), based on the Shannon index (p = 0.04).
2: There are similarities in microbiota community distribution of genera and phyla ( S2 Fig) between the wild-type and antibiotically-treated groups.
3: All flies, both wild-type and antibiotic-treated, had microbiotas dominated by the genus  Wolbachia (with a relative abundance of 96% and 98%, respectively,  S2 Fig,  S3 Table), an endoparasitic bacterium common in the cell bodies of fruit flies and other insects [ 48].
4: Wolbachia is not part of the gut microbiota, but is an internal bacterium that may contribute to microbial decay.
5: The next most common genera in both groups are  Lactobacillus,  Acetobacter, and  Streptococcus ( S2 Fig,  S3 Table), all of which are commonly reported as dominant genera in fruit fly gut microbiotas [ 19].
