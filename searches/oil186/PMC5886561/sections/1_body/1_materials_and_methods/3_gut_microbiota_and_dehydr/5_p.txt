0: To summarize, 16S rRNA sequencing of both types of fly showed differences in the minor components of the gut microbiome.
1: Differences in these less-abundant genera are sufficient to separate the untreated and antibiotic treated flies into two distinct gut biota groups, which are cohesive and significantly different from each other.
2: The antibiotic treated flies have a less diverse gut biota, containing 25 genera compared to the 44 genera in the wild-type flies ( S3 S5 Figs,  S3 Table).
