0: In the gut microbiota treatment group we used untreated wild-type flies and flies treated with an antibiotic to alter their bacterial composition and abundances.
1: Wild-type  Drosophila melanogaster were collected in October 2015 by netting after the harvest in a vineyard in Market Harborough (UK).
2: Immediately, fertilized females were isolated to generate isofemale lines.
3: The isofemale lines were continuously maintained at 18C in a 12hr:12hr Light:Dark (LD) cycle on standard corn meal food until the time of the experiment.
4: Groups of 10 males (34 days old) were collected from 28 isofemale lines and housed in 20 antibiotic treated or 20 untreated vials (for the antibiotic treatment groups and wild type treatment groups, respectively).
5: A solution of Ampicilin and Cloranphenicol (7mg/ml each in 50% Ethanol) was dropped (100ul) on the surface of the food in the antibiotic treated vials.
6: Treated vials were also exposed to UV O/N.
7: The vials were replaced every 2 days for a total of 10 days in LD12:12 at 25C.
8: The flies were then collected 3 hours after light on (Zeitgeber Time ZT 3) in UV treated 15ml falcon tube in ice, and were then entombed in resin.
