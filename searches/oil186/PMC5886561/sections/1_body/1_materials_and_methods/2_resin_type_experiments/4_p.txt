0: The chemical characterization of the  P.  sylvestris and  W.  nobilis resins confirms that they are distinct ( S1 Fig,  S1 Table).
1: Of the 52 identified compounds, 18 were only found in one of the two resins ( S1 Table, bolded compounds).
2: Of the remaining 34 compounds, eight were found in much higher concentrations in one resin than the other (the difference in the total percent of that compound in the two resins > 5%,  S1 Table).
3: In total we found twenty-three compounds that differ between  P.  sylvestris and  W.  nobilis resin ( S2 Table).
