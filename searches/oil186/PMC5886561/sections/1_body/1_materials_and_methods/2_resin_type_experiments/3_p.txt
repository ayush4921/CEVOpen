0: Based on taxonomy, we expected that the two resin chemistry variable states in this experiment were significantly different; we confirmed this through solid phase microextraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry (SPME GC-MS) to characterise the volatile and semi-volatile components in the resin following previous methods [ 38 41].
1: A 0.5 g sample of resin from each tree species was dried and powdered.
2: Prior to analyses each vial of resin powder was equilibrated at 80C for one hour and exposed to a 65 m Polydimethylsiloxane/Divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB) SPME fibre for one hour, and analysed on a Thermo Scientific Trace 1310 GC.
3: A liquid injection of a standard mixture containing a series of  n-alkanes was used to calibrate retention indices to aid in identifying the peaks.
4: The chromatograms for each sample were imported into the program AMDIS and the major peaks in each chromatogram were identified through a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) MS database search.
