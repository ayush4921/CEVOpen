0: Pinus sylvestris is a Pinaceaen, a family of trees whose resin (belonging to Class 5 in a mass spectroscopy resin chemistry classification scheme) is characterized by diterpenoids such as abietane and pimarane [ 1,  22].
1: Class 5 resin in general, and  Pinus resin in particular, does not polymerize well and is therefore very uncommon in the fossil record [ 1,  9,  21].
