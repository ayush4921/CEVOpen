0: Two species of resin-producing trees, with distinct resin chemistries, were used:  Wollemia nobilis and  Pinus sylvestris.
1: Wollemia nobilis is an Araucariacean, a family of trees whose resin (belonging to Class 1b in the mass spectroscopy resin chemistry classification scheme) is generally characterized by the presence of labanoid terpenoids and the absence of succinic acid [ 1,  20,  21].
2: There is evidence of Araucariacean resin production from the Cretaceous to the Recent [ 20]; a number of well-known fossiliferous amber assemblages are thought to have been produced by Araucariaceans, including Burmese amber, Lebanese amber, Spanish amber and French Charentes amber [ 30 37].
