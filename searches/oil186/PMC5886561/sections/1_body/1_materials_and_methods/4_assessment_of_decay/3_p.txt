0: The preservation state of fruit flies in resin in each treatment group is based upon the percentage of flies showing features consistent with decay such as: loss of cuticle, loss of internal tissues, presence of bubbles within body margin, and presence of ruptured abdomens.
1: We use Fisher Exact tests to determine if the different treatment groups are significantly associated with differences in decay.
2: Analyses were carried out using the online calculator available at  http://www.physics.csbsju.edu/stats/exact_NROW_NCOLUMN_form.html [ 49].
