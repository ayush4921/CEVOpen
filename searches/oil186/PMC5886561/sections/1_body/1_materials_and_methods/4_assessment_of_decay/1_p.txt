0: The assessment of decay in different treatment groups required observation of the external and internal features of the flies in the resin, for which we used phase contrast synchrotron tomography, following standard methods for fossil inclusions in amber [ 10].
1: We imaged the experiments using different tree resins at 18 months post-entombment.
2: At this point, the flies in  P.  sylvestris resin lacked all internal anatomy, so subsequent experiments to test gut microbiota and dehydration (flies in  W.  nobilis resin) were analysed after 2 weeks to capture possible variations in early-acting decay.
3: Both sets of experiments (resin type and gut biota/dehydration) included untreated flies in  W.  nobilis resin; these directly comparable treatment groups showed very similar amounts of decay at both 2 weeks and 18 months.
4: This suggests, that after a short burst of early decay, decay proceeds extremely slowly.
5: Importantly, for the assessment of decay sufficient morphological loss and modification to distinguish between treatments groups occurs within a 2 week timeframe.
