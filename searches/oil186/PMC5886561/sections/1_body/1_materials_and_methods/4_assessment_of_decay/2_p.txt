0: The synchrotron scans were analysed in the program VGStudios Max.
1: For each fly, we noted the presence or absence of cuticle, internal tissues and ruptured abdomens.
2: These data provide a direct indication of morphological decay.
3: The presence of internal bubbles was also noted and provides a proxy for decay.
4: Where bubbles occur the fly cuticle shows no significant expansion, but because bubbles take up space within the body margin internal tissues must be lost, severely diminished and/or distorted by being pushed aside by bubble formation.
5: It was difficult from the synchrotron images to distinguish between loss or distortion of tissues, but either way preservation fidelity of internal tissues is reduced through bubble formation.
