0: Both resin type and the degree of dehydration of partially-entrapped insects prior to their full entombment have been suggested to affect preservation quality in amber [ 9,  11], which is why we test these variables here.
1: We add the gut microbiome as an addition variable in our experiments for two reasons: first, in sediment-hosted exceptionally-preserved fossils it has been demonstrated to be an important control in decay and/or preservation [ 12 18]; and second, wild populations of fruit flies demonstrate significant variation in gut microbiota between populations [ 19].
