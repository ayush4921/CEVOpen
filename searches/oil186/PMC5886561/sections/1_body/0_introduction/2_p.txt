0: However, the fossil record in amber is subject to bias, which may limit and distort the extent to which the fossil assemblage represents the living assemblage.
1: There are two components to this bias: entrapment bias, which involves the non-random patterns by which organisms become engulfed in resin; and preservation bias, effectively the non-random patterns by which entrapped organisms decay or fossilize.
2: To date research effort has focused on entrapment into the resin [ 1 8], and a number of variables such as resin viscosity, insect behaviour and habitat and plant defences have been found to be influential [ 1,  2].
3: For example, fossil assemblages in amber favour the preservation of small, terrestrial inclusions, because these are most easily entrapped in resin flows [ 1,  2,  4].
4: Subsequent to entrapment and entombment in resin it has been suggested that essentially all organisms are preserved [ 2].
5: However, recent advances in 3D scanning techniques have revealed a cryptic and surprising variability of preservation quality of internal anatomy, even where external preservation quality is close-to life-like.
6: The variation ranges from internally complete fossils, retaining minute details of the most decay-prone tissues, through to fossils preserving only the most decay resistant features, to some which are hollow moulds.
7: This indicates that decay and preservation biases are operating once carcasses are entombed in resin [ 1,  2,  9,  10].
8: Such bias may responsible for some of the patterns in the amber fossil record that cannot be explained by entrapment; for example, the occurrence of non-fossiliferous amber sites [ 1,  2], and taxa whose overrepresentation in amber (for example ants in some Cenozoic amber) cannot easily be explained by their behaviour [ 1].
9: The assessment of the ecological completeness of amber fossil assemblages requires understanding of bias in the preservation process of insects, as well as entrapment bias.
