0: S3 Fig NMDS clustering of fruit flies based on various measures of gut microbiota similarity.
1: (A) Weighted UniFrac distance.
2: The untreated and antibiotic treated gut microbiota communities are all dominated by one genus, Wolbachia, and therefore they cannot be distinguished in a weighted NMDS analysis.
3: (B) Unweighted UniFrac distance.
4: The two treatment groups are distinct in an unweighted NMDS analysis using the UniFrac distance, because there are meaningful differences in the less abundant components of the gut microbiotas.
5: (C) Jaccard distance.
6: Once again, an unweighted distance metric also distinguishes the two gut microbiota treatment groups.
