0: S4 Fig Jaccard index of beta diversity.
1: Comparing the diversity within and between the two fruit fly treatment groups, indicating that the groups are cohesive and distinct from each other.
2: Cohesive: there is no significant difference in gut microbiota similarity within each treatment group (p = 0.066).
3: Distinct: there is a significant difference in the similarity within each group and the similarity between the groups (p-values of 0.001 and<0.001).
