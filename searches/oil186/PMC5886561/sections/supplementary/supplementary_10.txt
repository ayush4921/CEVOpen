0: S6 Fig MCA analysis of P. sylvestris and W. nobilis resin and various essential oils whose antibacterial properties are known.
1: Note that the MCA does separate the essential oils into those that do and do not inhibit the activity of L. plantarum.
2: However, the resins do not fall clearly into either group.
3: (A) MCA, assuming that coordinate 1 represents the antibacterial effectiveness of the compound against L. plantarum, in which case P. sylvestris resin seems to be more likely to effectively inhibit decay.
4: (B) MCA assuming that antibacterial effectiveness corresponds to a vector intermediate between coordinates 1 and 2, in which case W. nobilis resin seems likely to be slightly more effective at inhibiting decay.
