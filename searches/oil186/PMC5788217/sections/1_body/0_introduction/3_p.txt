0:  The practical advantage of antimicrobial combinations has been comprehended for over 50 years.
1: Combinations of two antimicrobial agents with a different mechanism of action, may enhance antimicrobial activity especially where resistance to a single agent develops by bacteria.
2: Also, due to synergy or additive interaction, the combination of drugs allows utilizing lower antimicrobial concentration, reducing the harmful side effects and increasing treatment efficacy.
3: 9 Tackling public health issues occur by the growing number of multidrug-resistant bacteria, proposes new antimicrobial formulation based on the combination of older antimicrobials with a rich source of new agents, such as natural products.
4: 10 Simultaneous use of EOs and other antimicrobial compounds with great disinfectant properties has a high priority since using EOs in high concentrations make some unpleasant organoleptic changes in food and also on food contact surface when used as a sanitizing compound.
5: Owing to the possible synergistic properties, combined use of EO with SNPs as a sanitizing mixture for food plant sanitation has been proposed.
6: 11 The combined application of nanoparticles with EO has been reported.
7: 2,  12 To understand the combined antimicrobial and biofilm removal properties of SNP and ZEO, their effects on two important bacterial pathogens,  Staph aureus and  Salm.
8: Typhimurium was investigated as a guideline for a possible application of formulated solution in sanitation schedule.
