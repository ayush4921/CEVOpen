0:  Nanotechnology, the science of study and use of structures at nanoscale, is a promising tool for producing novel materials with biomedical applications.
1: Silver nanoparticles (SNPs) has been extensively investigated in various scientific disciplines.
2: Silver in the form of silver nitrate and silver sulfadiazine has been widely used to cure bacterial infections associated with burns.
3: SNPs are considered as a potent antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral and antiprotozoal compound and it is also reported to have anti-inflammatory activities.
4: 1 Synthesis and use of SNPs as a new generation of antimicrobial agents would be a fascinating and economical tool to solve drug resistance.
5: Microorganisms display different responses to nanoparticles which is related to differences in the bacterial structure and the composition of the cell wall.
