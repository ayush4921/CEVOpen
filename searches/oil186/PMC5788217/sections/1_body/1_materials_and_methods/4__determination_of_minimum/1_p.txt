0:  The MICs and MBC of ZEO and SNP against both bacteria were determined in LB using broth microdilution assay in 96-wells polystyrene flat-bottomed microtitre plates based on CLSI guidelines.
1: 13 Two-fold serial dilutions of ZEO were prepared in 0.1% peptone water containing 0.15% agar (to make a stable emulsion of EO in peptone water), whereas dilutions of SNP were made in 0.1% peptone water.
2: The wells of a microplates with U-bottom were poured by 160 L of LB and 20 L of the bacterial suspension with OD 600 = 0.1 to reach a suspension with 10 6 CFU/ mL in each well.
3: Then, 20 L either ZEO or SNP concentrations were added into the desired wells to achieve final concentrations of 312 to 5000 g/ mL for ZEO and 62.5 to 2000 g/mL for SNP.
4: For every experiment, three controls, including LB alone, LB with bacteria and LB containing treatment agents without bacteria were used.
5: The plate was mixed on a plate shaker at 250 rpm for 20 s and incubated at 37  1 C for 24 h. MICs were determined visually and by using 0.01% (w/v) resazurin sodium salt solution as explained previously.
6: To determine MBCs, 10 L from each well was inoculated into LB agar at 37  1 C for 24 h. The MBC was determined as the lowest concentration of antimicrobial agents that produces 99.99% inhibition in the initial population of microorganism.
7: MBC: MIC ratio, which describes the relationship between the minimum  in vitro bactericidal concentration and the MIC of antimicrobial agents, were also investigated.
