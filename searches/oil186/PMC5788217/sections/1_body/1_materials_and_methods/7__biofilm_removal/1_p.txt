0:  Biofilm removal potential of both agents alone and in combination was assessed using 24-well flat-bottomed polystyrene microtiter plates according to the method explained previously with some modifications.
1: 17 An aliquot of 200 L of bacterial suspension with OD 600 = 0.1 was dispensed into each well which was filled previously with 1800 L of LB broth, using four repetitions per treatment to reach a suspension with 10 7 CFU/ mL per well.
2: After incubation for 24 h at 37 1 C, the planktonic cells in wells were then removed and the plates were washed three times with PBS and air-dried for 20 min at 23 2 C. Then, 2000 L of MIC, 2MIC and 4MIC concentrations of ZEO and SNP and their combinations (1/4 OIC, 1/2OIC, and OIC concentrations) were gently poured into the wells and incubated for 15 min at ambient temperature.
3: The solutions were then removed and plates were washed three times with PBS and air-dried for 20 min at 23 2 C. Following staining with 2 mL of 1% crystal violet (CV) (w/v) for 30 min, the contents of the wells were decanted and washed twice with tap water to remove the color excess and then allowed to air-dry for 30 min.
4: The biomass of biofilms was quantified by solubilizing CV with 2 mL of acetic acid 33% and subsequent measuring optical absorbance (OD) at 540 nm.
5: Wells containing LB broth and LB with bacteria without antibacterial were considered as negative and positive controls, respectively.
6: Biofilm removal percentage was calculated as follow:
