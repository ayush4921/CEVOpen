0:  Sanitizing effects of ZEO and SNP combination were investigated by determining the growth of the microorganism in LB broth supplemented with different concentration of antimicrobials (1/4OIC, 1/2OIC, and OIC) to obtain optimal concentration for both compounds according to the method explained before with some modifications.
1: 18 Bacterial cultures (110 7 CFU/ mL) (0.5 mL) were added to tubes containing 4.5 mL of antimicrobial agents in combination and then, tubes were incubated at 23 2 C for 15 min and bacterial growth was monitored by sampling (1mL) and counting the viable cells.
2: After sampling, 1 mL aliquot were dispersed in a 9 mL neutralizing solution containing an equal volume of sodium thiosulphate 5% w/v and Tween-20 and remained for 10 min, to neutralize the subsequent activity of agents and then serial dilutions were prepared.
