0:  260-nm absorbing material released into the supernatant was estimated according to the method described previously, 16 with some modifications.
1: The bacterial suspension was prepared as described above.
2: The procedure performed in 2 mL of harvested and washed cells (OD 600nm = 0.45) to which SNP and ZEO were added at final concentrations equivalent to their MICs and OIC and incubated in a shaker incubator (250 rpm at 37 C).
3: Two samples were taken at 15 and 60 min time points and centrifuged at 4000  g for 15 min and the absorbance was determined at 260 nm using PBS as blank.
4: Controls containing bacterial supernatant without treatment agents and antibacterial compounds without bacteria were also prepared and analyzed.
