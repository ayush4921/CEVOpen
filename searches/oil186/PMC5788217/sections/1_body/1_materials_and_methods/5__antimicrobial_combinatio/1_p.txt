0:  Broth checkerboard micro-assay was carried out to evaluate the antagonistic, indifferent, additive and synergistic interactions of ZEO and SNP using the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index method.
1: 14 Eight different concentrations, 5 concentrations lower than MIC, two concentrations higher than MIC and one concentration as same as MIC of ZEO and SNP were used to design an 8  8 checkerboards of combinations.
2: The microplates were prepared by dispensing 160 L of LB and 20 L of the logarithmic suspension of bacteria and 10 L of different concentration of both antimicrobial agents into each well.
3: Then, plates were kept in a plate shaker at 250 rpm for 20 s and incubated at 37  1 C for 24 h. MICs were determined visually and by resazurin reduction.
4: MICs of the individual antimicrobials and all of the combinations were used to calculate Fractional inhibitory concentrations (FICs) of ZEO and SNP and FIC index using the following formula:
