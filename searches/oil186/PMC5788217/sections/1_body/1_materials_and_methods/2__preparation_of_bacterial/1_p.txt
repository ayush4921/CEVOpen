2: Typhimurium were grown at 371 C for 18 h by transferring 10 microliters of frozen stocks (at -20 C) into 10 mL of LB broth.
3: Bacterial suspensions were adjusted to ~8 log 10 CFU mL -1 using visible-ultraviolet spectrophotometer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Buckinghamshire, UK) at 600 nm (optical density: ~0.1) and confirmed by plating and counting on LB agar after 24 h incubation at 371 C.
