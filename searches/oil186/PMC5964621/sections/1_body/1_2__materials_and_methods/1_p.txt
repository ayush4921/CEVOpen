0: The search strategy employed in this review includes internationally accepted databases, namely, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed, using specific keywords of both whole plant products and plant extracts, pain, and analgesic and antinociceptive effects.
1: For investigation, a combination of keywords was used [pain; analgesic; antinociceptive; plant extract] + [ Betonica officinalis;  Glechoma hederacea;  Hyptis pectinata;  Lavandula;  Leonurus cardiaca;  Lamium;  Melissa officinalis;  Mentha;  Marrubium vulgare;  Origanum;  Ocimum;  Rosmarinus officinalis;  Salvia; Satureja hortensis;  Stachys lavandulifolia;  Scutellaria lateriflora;  Sideritis;  Teucrium;  Thymus;  Ziziphora tenuior] + [Lamiaceae; botanical genus].
2: Case reports, case studies,  in vivo and  in vitro relevant studies, and comparative studies were included in this search strategy.
3: Additionally, text books and potentially relevant reviews were explored and included in the reference list.
4: The literature search was confined to the period between 2003 and December 2017.
5: Several articles before 2000 were also included in order to point out the universal interest in natural products with potential applicability in therapy.
6: The dynamic character of the field is reflected in the number of recent publications.
7: For example, a search with the keywords Lamiaceae family and pain in ScienceDirect yields 152 titles in 2015, 111 in 2016, and 129 in 2017, and 23 papers will be published in the first months of the next year ( Figure 1).
