0: Somaclonal variation is the variation seen in plants that have been produced by plant tissue culture.
1: It is particularly common in plants regenerated from callus [ 28,  29].
2: Typical somaclonal variations are the change in chromosome number, chromosome structure, and DNA sequence [ 29].
3: In this experiment, genetic homogeneity of the regenerated plantlet as compared to mother plants was examined by RAPD markers.
4: Total genomic DNA was extracted from young leaves of the in vitro regenerated cumin and mother plant following the CTAB procedure according to Murray and Thompson [ 30] with minor modifications.
5: Quality and quantity of extracted genomic DNA were checked on 1% agarose gel and spectrophotometer and the samples were diluted to a final concentration of 50 ng/ l. Ten RAPD primers (OPU6, OPU12, OPS17, OPJ18, OPJ19, OPJ21, OPC13, OPC8, OPQ6, and OPF5) were used for DNA amplification [ 31].
6: PCR amplification was performed in a 25  l reaction volume containing 9.5  l double-distilled water, 12.5  l PCR amplification kit (10x), 1  l primer (10 p mol), and 2  l DNA (50 ng/ l).
7: The amplification program included initial 5 min denaturation at 95C, followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 95C, 30 sec at 35C, and 2 min at 72C, with a final extension at 72C for 8 min.
8: The PCR products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized on a UV light transilluminator.
