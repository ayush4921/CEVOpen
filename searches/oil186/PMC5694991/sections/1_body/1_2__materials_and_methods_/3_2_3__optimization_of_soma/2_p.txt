0: Thereafter, the calli were transferred to the PGR-free medium for excluding of auxin effect and further stimulation of somatic embryogenesis.
1: The percentage of induced calli with embryogenic potential was calculated on the basis of a number of explants producing somatic embryogenesis/number of total cultured explants in each Petri dish after two to three weeks.
2: Data related to the percentage of plant regeneration were recorded during 12 weeks after the first culture.
3: The percentage of plant regeneration was calculated on the basis of the number of regenerated explants/the number of induced calli with embryogenic potential in each Petri dish.
