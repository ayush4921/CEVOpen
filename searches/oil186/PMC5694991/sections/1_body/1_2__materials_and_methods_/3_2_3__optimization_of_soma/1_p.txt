0: In second set of experiment, the cumin seeds were surface-sterilized following the procedure previously described [ 22].
1: To obtain plantlets, the sterilized seeds were cultured in the half-strength MS medium and stored in the growth chamber [ 21].
2: One month after seed culturing, when grown plantlets were about 5 cm in height, about 0.5 cm of each explant including hypocotyl and cotyledon was prepared.
3: The prepared explants were cultured in MS medium containing 3% (w/v) sucrose and 0.8% (w/v) agar and supplemented with 7 different concentrations of PGRs (2,4-D and Kin) ( Table 2).
4: The cultured explants were incubated in the growth chamber at 24C  2C, 75% relative humidity, and dark condition during the first month of culture.
5: After this step, the formed calli were subcultured into fresh mediums containing the previous combination of PGRs and then were stored in the growth chamber at 24C  2C and 75% relative humidity under 16/8 h photoperiod with 50  mol 2 s 1 photosynthetic photon flux density provided by cool white fluorescent light.
6: Data related to the percentage of callus formation was recorded five weeks after culture.
7: Seven weeks after culture, calli images were taken by a camera under the same situations and then perimeter and area of calli were calculated by Digimizer, an image analysis software (version 4.3.1, MedCalc Software, Belgium).
8: In the eighth week, the symptoms of somatic embryogenesis in some of the studied mediums were observed without transferring the calli to the PGRs-free medium; then different stages of the somatic embryogenesis were recorded using a microscope.
