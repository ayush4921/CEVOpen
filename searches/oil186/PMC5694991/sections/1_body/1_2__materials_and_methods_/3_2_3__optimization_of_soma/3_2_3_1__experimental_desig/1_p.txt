0: The experiment was performed in a factorial form using a completely randomized design with three factors and three replications (as Petri dishes).
1: Five explant segments were placed in each Petri dish containing 25 ml different medium.
2: Studied factors included two Iranian cumin landraces, Golestan and North Khorasan, two explants, hypocotyl and cotyledon, and 7 different concentrations of PGRs ( Table 2).
3: The data related to the percentage of callus formation, perimeter, and area of calli were subjected to ANOVA and DMRT to evaluate the statistical significance and were expressed as the mean  SE.
4: Since the distribution of the recorded data related to measured characters including the percentage of induced calli with embryogenic potential and the percentage of plant regeneration was not normal and no transformation was able to induce normality, the Kruskal-Wallis and the MannWhitney nonparametric tests were used and median grouping was made [ 27].
5: SAS 9.2, SPSS 16.0, and Excel software were used for data analysis.
