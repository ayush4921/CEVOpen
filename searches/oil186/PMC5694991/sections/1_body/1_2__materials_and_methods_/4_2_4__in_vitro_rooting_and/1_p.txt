0: Since the best response of plant regeneration was observed in the MS medium containing 0.1 mg/L Kin, the regenerated 3 to 4 cm long plantlets were excised from mentioned medium and then were cultured in pots containing half-strength MS medium.
1: The following treatments were investigated for more rooting: MS + PGR-free, MS + IAA (0.35 mg/L), MS + NAA (0.37 mg/L), and MS + IAA (0.35 mg/L) + NAA (0.37 mg/L).
2: Pots were observed every 3-4 days regularly and then some of the characters including days to production of the main rooting, the percentage of produced main rooting, and the percentage of produced lateral rooting were recorded to compare investigated treatments.
3: After 3 weeks, sufficiently developed cumin plantlets containing rooting were transplanted into plastic pots containing sterilized garden soil.
4: Then, the pots were covered with the plastic cover for maintaining of plants moisture and kept in the greenhouse for two weeks.
5: Thereafter, they were acclimatized to greenhouse conditions by removing the covering plastic.
6: Percentage of survival plantlets was recorded and then they were kept until flowering and seed production.
