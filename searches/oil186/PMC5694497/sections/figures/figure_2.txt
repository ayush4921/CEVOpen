0:  Heat map of the volatile compounds characterized from essential oil extracts via GC-MS FID of 17 Vitex species.
1: Heat map was generated using Euclidean Distance and the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean cluster algorithm.
2: Compounds representing at least 2% of the GC-FID signal were included (for a listing of compounds, see Supplementary Table S1 ). )
