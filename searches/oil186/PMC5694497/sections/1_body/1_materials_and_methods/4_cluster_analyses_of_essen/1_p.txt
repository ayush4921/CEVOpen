0: Molecules comprising at least 2% of the total FID signal were summarized for the four  Vitex species from this study as well as 13 species referenced in the literature ( Supplementary Table   S1).
1: The cluster analysis was then carried out using the Euclidean Distance and the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) cluster algorithm ( Sokal and Michener, 1958).
2: Statistical analysis was performed using the Paleontological Statistics Software Package for Education and Data Analysis (PAST) ( Hammer et al., 2001).
3: Dendrograms were then generated which assigned diversity of the 17  Vitex species based on their essential oil components.
