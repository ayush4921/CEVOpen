0: The four  Vitex species we collected ( Vitex capitata, V. megapotamica, V. gardneriana and  V. rufescens) were analyzed by repeat sequence primers via Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR).
1: The DNA was extracted from young, fresh leaves as previously described ( Doyle, 1991).
2: Fourteen primers were used to screen for polymorphisms ( Table   1).
3: The PCR amplification parameters and ISSR method used followed that as described in  Sena Filho et al.
