0: Essential oil characterization was performed using methods described previously ( Bittrich et al., 2013;  Ramos et al., 2013;  Feitosa-Alcantara et al., 2017).
1: Specifically, a GC-MS/FID (QP2010 Ultra, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with an autosampler (AOC-20i, Shimadzu) was used to separate compounds with an Rtx -5MS Restek fused silica capillary column (5%-diphenyl95%-dimethyl polysiloxane) of 30 m  0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 m film thickness, at a constant helium (99.999% purity) flow rate of 1.2 mLmin -1.
2: An injection volume of 0.5 L was employed, with a split ratio of 1:10.
3: The oven temperature program started at 60C, was held for 3 min, then increased at a rate of 5C/min to 300C, and was finally held for 9 min.
4: The MS and FID data were simultaneously acquired by employing a detector splitting system, with a split flow ratio of 5:1 (MS:FID).
5: A 0.4 m  0.15 mm i.d.
6: restrictor tube (capillary column) was used to connect the splitter to the MS detector, while a 0.6 m  0.22 mm i.d.
7: restrictor tube was used to connect the splitter to the FID detector.
8: The MS data were acquired in full scan mode ( m/z of 40-550) at a scan rate of 0.3 scan/s using an electron ionization potential of 70 eV.
9: The injector temperature was set to 280C and the ion source temperature to 200C.
10: The FID temperature was 300C, and the gas supplies for the FID were hydrogen, air, and helium at flow rates of 30, 300, and 30 mLmin -1, respectively.
11: Quantification of each constituent was estimated by FID peak-area normalization (%).
12: Compound concentrations were calculated from the GC peak areas relative to the total peak area of all peaks and were arranged in order of GC elution.
13: The retention index was obtained by co-injecting the oil sample with a C7C30 linear hydrocarbon mixture; identification was made based on comparison of retention indices and fragmentation patterns with published values ( Linstrom and Mallard, 2005;  Adams, 2007).
