0: Concentration-mortality bioassays ( Silva et al., 2013) were conducted to estimate the lethal concentration (LC) of the essential oil extracted from four  Vitex species ( V. capitata, V. megapotamica, V. gardneriana, and  V. rufescens) to adult coconut mites ( A. guerreronis).
1: A preliminary bioassay was performed using a wide concentration range where the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) and the concentration able to kill 100% of  A. guerreronis were determined.
2: Afterward, four concentrations within this range were used to generate a concentration response curve as follows: oil was sprayed onto perianth disks (1 cm diameter) of young coconut fruits placed in Petri dishes containing agar at 5%.
3: Spraying of the oils was performed at a pressure of 34 kPa (0.34 bar) with a 9.3-ml spray rate using a Potter Tower device (Burkard, Rickmansworth, United Kingdom) ( Oliveira et al., 2017).
4: Sprayed perianth disks were allowed to dry for 20 min before 20 adult  A. guerreronis were placed onto each disk.
5: Control disks were sprayed with acetone, which was also used to dissolve and dilute the oils for all concentrations.
6: Petri dishes were individually maintained in an incubator at 26C and 70% relative humidity for 24 h. Eight replicates (wells) for each oil concentration were used.
7: Harmfulness of the commercial acaricide abamectin (Vertimec 18 EC TM; 18 g a.i./L, at field dosage 75 mL/100 L) to  A. guerreronis was evaluated as a way of toxicity comparison (20 replicates were performed and control disks were sprayed with distilled water).
8: Mite mortality was assessed after 24 h of exposure and concentration-mortality curves were estimated by Probit analysis using the PROC PROBIT procedure in SAS (version 9.4, Cary, NC, United States).
9: The likelihood ratio chi-square goodness-of-fit was applied to evaluate whether the data adequately conformed to the PROBIT model ( Robertson et al., 2007).
