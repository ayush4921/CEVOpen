0: Metabolomic profiles from organisms in the Plantae and other kingdoms have been used to distinguish samples from different species and ecotypes, as well as aid in their classification ( Dettmer et al., 2007;  Allwood et al., 2011;  Aliferis et al., 2013;  Jing et al., 2015).
1: In the case of plants, much attention has been given to one of the largest group of metabolites they produce, the terpenoids.
2: In a study similar to ours which explored the chemodiversity of  Selaginella in the context of evolution,  Weng and Noel (2013) suggest that monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases are derived from conserved diterpene synthases, based off of phylogenetic analyses of plant terpene synthases done by  Bohlmann et al.
3: (1998).
4: Thus, it appears that monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are frequently used as chemical markers for distinguishing between genera.
5: For example, in the  Lantana (Verbenaceae) genus, -caryophyllene was the major compound suggested as a chemical marker ( Sena Filho et al., 2010), while in  Citrus, both cyclic ( R-(+)-limonene and -terpinene) and bicyclic monoterpenes ( -pinene and sabinene) were dominant in fruit essential oils and therefore proposed as markers for those species/varieties ( Jing et al., 2015).
6: Worldwide, the volatile metabolomics composition of  Vitex species has been poorly investigated, likely due to their accessibility and phenotype, namely, their size and bad odor.
7: From a total of 250 species, only about 35 are reported in the literature with in-depth chemical characterizations.
8: Many of them are difficult to identify due to endemism, e.g.,  Vitex rufences A. Juss,  Vitex capitata Vahl,  Vitex gardneriana Schauer, which are found only in areas in the northeast of Brazil.
