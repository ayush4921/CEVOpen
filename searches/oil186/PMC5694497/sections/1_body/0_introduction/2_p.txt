0: The main goal of this study was to develop a metabolomics approach for evaluating the volatile composition of  Vitex species, using four species we collected ( Vitex capitata Vahl,  Vitex megapotamica (Spreng.)
1: Moldenke,  Vitex gardneriana Schauer and  Vitex rufescens A. Juss) in addition to 13  Vitex species published in the literature.
2: First, the chemical composition of the volatile fraction of essential oils from leaves of these species was characterized via GC-MS/FID.
3: Subsequently, cluster analyses of the chemical composition of the 17  Vitex species were performed.
4: Next, Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) was used to evaluate the genetic variation between our four  Vitex species, followed by cluster analyses.
5: Lastly, bioactivity of our four essential oil extracts was evaluated using toxicity assays against  Aceria guerreronis Keifer (Acari: Eriophyidae), a major pest found in coconut plantations worldwide ( Navia et al., 2013).
6: From this study, we aimed to chemosystematically characterize the  Vitex genus, in addition to expand our understanding of it in an evolutionary context.
