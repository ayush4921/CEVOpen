0: Thus, the detrimental effects of radiation-induced alterations in biologic systems via reactive oxygen species generation play a crucial role in maintenance of metabolic homeostasis in the body.
1: Therefore, any disparity in homeostasis results in oxidative stress [ 38], which can be trounced by additional provision of naturally occurring, plant based antioxidants [ 3941].
2: It has been shown that the oxidation process could be halted by antioxidants by adopting various strategies such as scavenging, chelating or transferring hydrogen atoms [ 4244].
3: It has been speculated that the radioprotectors must have radical-scavenging properties along with antioxidant function; however, all antioxidants do not provide radioprotection [ 45].
4: Radioprotectors minimize or reduce the radiation-induced damage to normal tissues and need to be present before or at the time of radiation exposure for its protective efficacy [ 46].
5: In recent years, investigations have demonstrated the importance and usefulness of aromatic plants for their radioprotective effects and ability to be employed for modification of oxidative insult due to radiation.
6: Therefore, the present review focused on medicinally important aromatic plants with special reference to radioprotective activity ( Table 1).
