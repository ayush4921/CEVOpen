0: It is a well-known fact that radiation is a powerful cytotoxic agent.
1: Reactive oxygen species such as superoxide anion, singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radical, nitric oxide, hydrogen peroxide and peroxyl radicals are generated by ionizing radiation in biologic system through radiolysis of water and are accountable for cellular injury caused to DNA and proteins [ 3133].
2: Free radicals generated through ionizing radiation attack DNA, producing single strand breaks and double strand breaks (DSBs) due to oxidative insult to sugar moiety and base components [ 33, 34].
3: Unrepaired or misrepaired DSBs eventually lead to the chromosomal aberrations, ultimately paving the way to mutagenesis, carcinogenesis and hereditary diseases.
4: Thus, DSBs are considered as the most vulnerable radiation-induced DNA damage.
5: Homologous recombination and nonhomologous end joining are major pathways involved in repair of DSB in eukaryotic cells [ 35].
6: In the nonhomologous end joining pathway, DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), which consists of DNA-PKcs (DNA-PK catalytic subunit) and Ku70/Ku80 (also known as Ku86) heterodimer, acts as the molecular sensor for DSBs.
7: DSBs are finally sealed by DNA ligase IV, in association with XRCC4 and XLF (also known as Cernunnos).
8: DNA-PK phosphorylates a number of proteins, including XRCC4 in response to radiation [ 36, 37].
9: Although the role of phosphorylation of XRCC4 in DSB repair remains to be clarified, the phosphorylation status of XRCC4 will serve as marker of DNA-PK functionality in living cells.
