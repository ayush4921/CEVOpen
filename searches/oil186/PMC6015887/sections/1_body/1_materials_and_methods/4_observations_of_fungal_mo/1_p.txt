0: The action mechanism of CEO was determined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) according to a previous study with minor modifications ( Bozzola and Russell, 1999).
1: Seven-day-old  C. acutatum exposed to 0, MFC and 2MFC of CEO were cultivated in the dark at 25C for 2 days.
2: The mycelia was harvested from PDA with 10 mL of SDW and softly scraping the colonies with a sterile L-shaped glass rod.
3: The mycelium suspension was centrifuged at 7000  g for 15 min to obtain mycelia.
4: The small segments measuring 5  5 mm were excised at the margin of the mycelium colony.
5: Then, the segments were promptly placed in vials containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer saline (PBS) (pH 7.2) at 4C and fixed overnight.
6: The fixed samples were rinsed with the same buffer three times for 10 min.
7: Afterward, the samples were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol (70, 80, 90, 95, and 100%,  v/v) for 20 min in each alcohol dilution.
8: The last step was performed for 30 min thrice.
9: The dehydrated specimens were then embedded and polymerized in Spurrs resin at 65C for 72 h. Ultrathin sections (approximately 50 nm in thickness) were hand trimmed with a diamond knife using an MT-X Ultratome for TEM observations (H-600, Hitachi Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).
