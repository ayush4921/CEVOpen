0: Membrane integrity was determined using fluorescent microscope (FSM) according to a previous study with minor modifications ( Liu et al., 2010).
1: C. acutatum was treated with the MFC of CEO as described previously.
2: PDA plates without CEO were served as negative controls.
3: Mycelia were collected after incubation for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 days in the dark at 25C, and washed with cold PBS (0.05 mol/L, pH 7.0) to remove residual medium, respectively.
4: Mycelia were then fixed by cold ethanol (70%,  v/v) at 4C for 1 h. After removal of ethanol, and the mycelia were washed twice with PBS.
5: Then the mycelia were stained with 50 g/mL propidium iodide for 20 min at 4C in the dark.
6: Mycelia were collected by centrifugation (4000  g for 10 min), and washed twice with PBS to remove residual dye.
7: Samples were observed with the E200 Nikon Eclipse microscope (Nikon Co., Tokyo, Japan).
8: Fields of view from each cover slip were chosen randomly, and each treatment was replicated thrice and the experiment was repeated thrice.
9: The number of spores in bright-field was defined as the total number, and membrane integrity (MI) was calculated as:
