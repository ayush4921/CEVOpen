0: The ergosterol content was determined using a previously described method with minor modifications ( Tian et al., 2012).
1: The same treatment used in the mycelial growth assay was examined.
2: After incubation, mycelia were harvested and washed with 10 mL of SDW.
3: A 5 mL of mixed solution (20 mL of methanol, 5 mL of ethanol and 2.0 g of potassium hydroxide) was added to each sample.
4: After 2 min of vortex using TS-1 Eddy oscillometer (Kylin-Bell Lab Instruments Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), the mixed solution was incubated at 85C for 4 h. Sterols were extracted from each sample by adding a mixture of 2 mL of SDW and 5 mL of  n-heptane.
5: Then, the mixture was sufficiently mixed by vortex for 2 min allowing the layers to separate for 1 h at room temperature.
6: The  n-heptane layer was analyzed by UV-1800 PC spectrophotometer at 230 and 282 nm (Shanghai AoXi Science Instrument Co. Ltd, Shanghai, China).
7: The presence of ergosterol (at 282 nm) and the sterol intermediate 24(28) dehydroergosterol (at 230 nm) in the  n-heptane layer led to a characteristic curve.
8: The content of ergosterol was calculated as a percentage of the wet weight based on the absorbance and wet weight of the initial pellet.
9: It was calculated as the follow equation,
