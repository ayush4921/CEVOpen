0: The isolate was grown on potato dextrose broth (PDB) with 140 r/min at 25C for 5 days.
1: The genomic DNA of mycelia was extracted by kit (Eppendorf, Holstein City, Germany).
2: The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions and the small subunit (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) of the rDNA genes were amplified using the primer set ITS1 (5-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3) and ITS4 (5-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3) ( Zhao et al., 2010).
3: Primers were synthesized by Shanghai Sangon Biological Engineering Technology & Services Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China).
4: PCR amplification was carried out in aqueous volumes of 25 L. The reactions contained 0.5 L template DNA (30 ng), 0.5 L (10 mol/L) of each primer, 5  PCR buffer (with MgCl 2) 2.5 L, 0.5 L dNTP (2.5 mmol/L), 0.5 L Taq polymerase (2.5 U/L) and 20 L ddH 2O.
5: PCR reactions were performed on a ABI 2720 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, United States).
6: Thermal cycling was carried out using an initial denaturation step at 98C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 98C for 25 s, annealing at 55C for 25 s and extension at 72C for 60 s. Cycling was completed by a final elongation step at 72C for 10 min.
7: PCR products were purified using PCR purification kit (Shanghai Sangon Biological Engineering Technology & Services Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China).
8: Sequencing was performed with an ABI 3730XL automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, United States).
9: Further, the sequence was analyzed and determined to search for similar sequences from the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) software 1 algorithm at National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).
10: To construct the relevant phylogenic tree, MEGA 5.02 software was employed ( Saitou and Nei, 1987;  Tamura et al., 2007).
