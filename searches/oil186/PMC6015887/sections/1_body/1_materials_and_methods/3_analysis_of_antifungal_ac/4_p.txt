0: The inhibitory effect of CEO on spore germination and germ tube elongation of  C. acutatum was determined using a vapor contact method proposed from previous study with minor modifications ( Liu et al., 2007).
1: To stimulate sporulation,  C. acutatum was grown on PDA in the dark at 25C.
2: Spores were harvested from 7 days old cultures with 10 mL of SDW and softly scraping the colonies with a sterile L-shaped glass rod.
3: Spore suspension was filtered through sterile paper to remove mycelial fragments.
4: Hundred microlliter of spore suspension of 10 8 CFU/mL was plated on the inner side of petri dishes ( = 90 mm) with 20 mL of PDA.
5: The same CEO concentrations used in the mycelial growth assay were examined.
6: Each plate was incubated in the dark at 25C for 1 days.
7: In the end, germinal spores were observed using a light microscope (Olympus CX 31, Olympus Co., Tokyo, Japan) at 400 magnification.
8: Each slide was fixed in lactophenol cotton blue.
9: Results were expressed in terms of the percentage of spore germination inhibition by comparing control and treated plates ( Trabelsi et al., 2016;  Ribes et al., 2017).
