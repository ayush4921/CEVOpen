0: The use of chemically synthetic preservative in controlling food spoilage and pathogenic fungus has been a controversial topic ( Tian et al., 2014).
1: The artificially chemical compounds are considered as chronic and reproductive toxicants causing respiratory diseases or other health risks ( Fleming-Jones and Smith, 2003).
2: In this case, natural preservatives such as essential oil (EO) have been extensively used due to its biodegradable and antimicrobial properties.
3: EO contains a variety of substances called phytochemicals, which belong to natural components in plants ( Pratt, 1992).
4: The phytochemical preparations with dual functionalities in preventing lipid oxidation and antimicrobial properties have tremendous potential for extending shelf life of food products ( Singh et al., 2007;  Fadli et al., 2012).
5: Generally, EO possesses high volatility.
6: When EO is applied as a vapor, less oil is used.
7: Further, the residues of EO on the product are minimized, and there will be less of a problem with tainting ( Szczerbanik et al., 2007).
8: It may be more appropriate to use EO in their vapor phase for postharvest applications ( Concha et al., 1998;  Zollo et al., 1998).
9: Cinnamon ( Cinnamomum zeylanicum or  Cinnamomum verum), rich in EO, belongs to Lauraceae family comprising about 250 species and usually distributes in India, China, Sri Lanka, and Australia ( Prasad et al., 2009).
10: Cinnamon essential oil (CEO) is a promising food preservative for the inhibition of foodborne pathogens and spoilage microorganisms ( Tian et al., 2012).
11: Our previous studies have shown that CEO have good efficacy on preservation of Hongyang kiwifruit.
12: Moreover, Hongyang kiwifruit fumigated with 0.4 L/mL of CEO could be stored at (4  1) C with relative humidity of 9095% for 120 days ( He et al., 2015).
13: CEO has been demonstrated as a strong and broad range of inhibition for bacteria, fungi and yeast ( Chao et al., 2000;  Manso et al., 2015).
14: Our previous studies have demonstrated that CEO have good inhibitory effects against  Botryosphaeria parva in vitro, and can reduce soft rot on Hongyang kiwifruit  in vivo ( He et al., 2015).
15: Antifungal activity of CEO against  C. acutatum isolated from strawberry anthracnose was investigated ( Duduk et al., 2015).
16: Cell plasma membrane (PM) is the action site invaded by antifungal substances, such as silicon and chlorine dioxide ( Wei et al., 2008;  Liu et al., 2010).
17: For fungi, the integrity of PM plays a crucial role in maintaining cell constituents being important to viability, such as sugar, protein and nucleic acid.
18: The soluble sugar, soluble protein and nucleic acid are the basic and functional components in the cell.
19: The PM is damaged, and the intracellular components can be leaked ( Wei et al., 2008;  Kim et al., 2009;  Liu et al., 2010).
20: The antifungal activity of EO was strongly associated with its compositions, such as monoterpenic phenoles, especially thymol, carvacrol, and eugenol ( Barrera-Necha et al., 2008).
21: The antifungal mechanism of EO is speculated to induce membrane disruption by their lipophilic compounds ( Cowan, 1999).
22: The low-molecular-weight and highly lipophilic components of EO pass easily through cell membranes and cause disruption to the fungal cell organization ( Chao et al., 2005;  Shukla et al., 2012).
23: Therefore, in this study, the dominant pathogens, which caused postharvest diseases such as anthracnose in Hongyang kiwifruit, was firstly isolated and identified.
24: Further, the antifungal activity and the possible antifungal mechanism of CEO against  C. acutatum isolated from decayed Hongyang kiwifruit were investigated.
