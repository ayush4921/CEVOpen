0:  Effects of CEO on percentage of plasma membrane integrity (A), ergosterol content (B), extracellular conductivity (C), and protein (D), sugar (E), and nucleic acid (F) leakage of C. acutatum.
1: (A) Percentage of plasma membrane integrity of C. acutatum spores, C. acutatum was cultured in PDA containing CEO or in PDA without CEO as the control at 25C; (B) Ergosterol contents of C. acutatum on PDA containing different concentrations of CEO at 25C were assayed; (C) Cellular leakage from fungal tissues was determined 06 days after incubation with the CEO.
2: Mycelia were cultured in PDA containing CEO or in SDW without EO as the control at 25C.
3: Samples for the leakage were measured for 6 days; (D) Soluble protein leakage of C. acutatum; (E) Soluble sugar leakage of C. acutatum; (F) Nucleic acid leakage of C. acutatum.
4: Values are the averages of the replicates for all the analyses.
5: Error bars are  SD of the means.
6: In some cases the error bar is obscured by the symbol.
7: Columns with different letters at each time point indicate significant differences according to Duncans multiple range tests at p< 0.05. )
