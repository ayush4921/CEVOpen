0: Oil production has been experiencing decline in many parts of the world due to oilfield's maturity and an example of such includes the major oilfields in the North Sea [ 1].
1: Another major concern is the increasing energy demands due to global population growth and the difficulty in discovering new oilfields as an alternative to the exploited oil fields.
2: Therefore, there is an urge to find out alternative technologies to increase oil recovery from existing oilfields around the world.
3: It is a fact that fossil fuels will still remain the key source of energy, regardless of the gross investments in other energy sources such as biofuels, solar energy, and wind energy.
4: This fact is highlighted by the current global energy production from fossil fuels which currently stand at about 8090% with oil and gas representing about 60% [ 2].
5: During oil production, primary oil recovery can account for 3040% oil productions, while additional 1525% can be recovered by secondary methods such as water injection leaving behind about 3555% of oil as residual oil in the reservoirs [ 3].
6: This residual oil is usually the target of many enhanced oil recovery technologies and it amounts to about 24 trillion barrels [ 4] or about 67% of the total oil reserves [ 5].
7: Residual oil recovery is at present necessitated for many oil companies and so there is a constant hunt for a cheap and efficient technology which will raise the global oil production as well as the productive life of many oilfields.
8: The recovery of this residual oil is accomplished by enhanced oil recovery (EOR) or tertiary recovery methods which are used in oil industry to increase the production of crude oil.
9: Indigenous or in situ microbial enhanced oil recovery (IMEOR) is one of the techniques in which the inhabitant microbes in the oil reservoirs were stimulated to enhance oil recovery [ 6].
10: IMEOR is reported as a cost-effective method [ 7].
11: The microbial community composition is influenced by oil reservoir geological conditions and other external factors like nutrient and water flooding, biosurfactant and biopolymer application, and steam injection [ 8].
