0: Complex environmental samples need some technique which can read multiple sequences in parallel.
1: Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) can obtain DNA sequences directly from environmental samples [ 9,  10].
2: In the study, the distribution of bacteria in steam-injected heavy oil wells (South Oman) with alkaline pH was characterized using high-throughput sequencing technique, Ion Torrent-Personal Genome Machine (PGM).
3: The spore-forming bacteria in the samples were also identified using culture-based method.
