0: For the advancement of a reliable MEOR protocol, understanding the microflora that exist in the oil reservoir is essential.
1: Conventional culture-based techniques have been widely used for bacterial identification and enumeration in oil fields.
2: Culture-based technique is selective and aids in the identification of only a few of the microbes.
3: The problem is even worsened in extreme environmental conditions such as oil fields, where only microbes that can withstand strict circumstances will survive.
4: Therefore, genomic analysis has become an important tool for understanding ecological biodiversity.
5: It evades the need for laboratory cultivation and isolation of individual isolates.
