0: Cultivable spore-forming bacterial isolates were identified by 16S rDNA sequencing using 27F and 1492R universal primers as described previously [ 11], where briefly the genomic DNA was extracted using PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories Inc.), and the amplification was performed using T100TM thermal cycler (Bio-Rad, USA).
1: The PCR products were purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGen).
2: The BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied BiosystemsTM) was used for de novo sequencing.
3: The sequencing was done using 3130 XL Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystem, Hitachi) at Central Analytical and Applied Research Unit (CAARU), Sultan Qaboos University, and was submitted to NCBI GenBank USA.
4: The dendrogram was constructed using maximum likelihood (ML) methods, respectively, using PHYLIP, the Phylogeny Inference Package program.
5: The ML program uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) method of inferring different rates of evolution at different sites [ 12].
