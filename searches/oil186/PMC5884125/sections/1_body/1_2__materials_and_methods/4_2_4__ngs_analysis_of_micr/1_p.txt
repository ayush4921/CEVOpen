0: The metagenomics analysis of all the 10 soil samples was done following the instruction manual of the Ion PGM System.
1: The total gDNA extracted from the soil samples was amplified using 16S Primer Sets targeting hypervariable V4 region: 515F (5-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3) and 806R (5-GGACTACVSGGGTATCTAAT-3).
2: The PCR procedure was with an initial denaturation at 95C for 10 min, 25 cycles of denaturation for 30 sec at 95C, annealing at 58C, extension at 72C for 20 sec, followed by holding at 72C for 7 min and a final hold at 4C for .
3: The amplified product was purified using Agencourt AMPure XP Reagent and 70% ethanol.
4: The DNA input for library preparation was calculated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and the library was prepared using Ion Plus Fragment Library Kit, following the user instructions.
5: The pooled short amplicons were end-repaired using 5x End Repair Buffer and End Repair Enzyme and purified using Agencourt AMPure XP Reagent and 70% ethanol.
6: Barcoded libraries were prepared using Ion XpressTM Barcode Adapters 116 Kit.
7: The adapters are ligated using DNA Ligase and the nicks were repaired using Nick Repair Polymerase.
8: The DNA template for Ion PGM System was prepared using the Ion PGM Template OT2 400 Kit and the Ion OneTouchTM 2 System following the instructions in Ion PGM Template OT2 400 Kit User Guide.
9: And the library was sequenced using the Ion Personal Genome Machine (PGMTM) System and the Ion PGM Sequencing 400 Kit.
