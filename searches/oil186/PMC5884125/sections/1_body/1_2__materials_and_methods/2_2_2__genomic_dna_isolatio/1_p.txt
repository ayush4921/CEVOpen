0: The genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated from cultivable spore-forming bacteria by boiling suspended soil samples in 10 ml distilled water at 90C for 30 min to kill all the vegetative cells and enrichment of the bacteria in Bushnell-Haas media (BH media) containing 1% heavy crude oil.
1: The flasks inoculated with the boiled sample supernatant were incubated at 40C for 24 h and plated on fresh BH agar plates to obtain pure cultures.
2: The gDNA from the isolates and the soil samples was isolated using PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories Inc.).
3: The nucleic acid concentration and purity were measured by Thermo Fischer NanoDropTM 2000/2000 c spectrophotometer.
