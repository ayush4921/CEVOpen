0:  (a) Purified gDNA from isolates electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide.
1: First lane contains the 10000 bp molecular weight markers from 300 bp to 10200 bp in length.
2: Other lanes are gDNA samples extracted from the isolates using PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit; (b) DNA extracted from 10 heavy crude soil samples in 2% agarose gel.
3: Lane 1 is the 1 Kb DNA ladder.
4: 110 represent the gDNA from 10 soil samples. )
