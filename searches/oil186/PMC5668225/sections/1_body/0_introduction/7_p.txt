0: Over the years specific studies designed to identify an analysis procedure for the determination of headspace gas at equilibrium with liquid essential oil have been reported [ 19 21].
1: These works are mostly based on the use of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) by which the headspace gas is extracted by a fused silica fiber coated with a suitable stationary phase (HS-SPME) [ 19,  20].
2: The volatile compounds adsorbed on the fiber are then thermally desorbed in the GC injector port of a GCMS instrument to perform the qualitative analysis and GCFID for the quantitative determination [ 22].
