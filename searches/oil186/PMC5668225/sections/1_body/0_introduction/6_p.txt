0: The migration of volatile molecules into the headspace phase does not just depend on their volatility but also on their affinity for the liquid phase sample; volatile compounds relative concentrations between the two phases will reach an equilibrium value.
1: At equilibrium, the partial pressure of each volatile component in the headspace vapor will be equivalent to the vapor pressure that is directly proportional to its mole fraction in the liquid phase.
2: In essence, the concentration of a compound in the headspace is proportional to its concentration in the liquid phase and can be affected by temperature, respective volumes of the sample and the headspace, and other factors [ 18].
3: Thus, headspace phase composition can be very different from that of the liquid phase.
