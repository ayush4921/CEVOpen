0: However, the composition of volatile compounds adsorbed on the fiber is different from that of headspace gas in equilibrium with the essential oil since the adsorption on the fiber depends on the fiber characteristics and extraction conditions used for the analysis.
1: Therefore, this procedure is not sufficient to define the actual composition of the vapor phase in equilibrium with the essential oil, and hence poorly applicable to the study of aromatherapy.
