0: Mass spectra were obtained with a computerized system constituted by a GC Hewlett-Packard 6890 gas chromatograph coupled to a mass selective detector Hewlett-Packard 5973N and equipped with GC-MS ChemStation software (version G1701DA), using the same analytical conditions as above.
1: Transfer line temperature was 280C.
2: Mass spectra were taken over m/z 35400, using an ionizing voltage of 70 eV.
