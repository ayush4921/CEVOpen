0: Identification of essential oil constituents was achieved by means of their GC linear retention indices (RI) in the two stationary phases, determined in relation to a homologous series of  n-alkanes (823 carbons) and a homologous series of fatty acid methyl esters (methyl esters of fatty acids with 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18 carbon atoms, FAME indices), and comparison of fragmentation patterns in the mass spectra with those stored in our own library or in the GC-MS database and with literature data (Mc Lafferty,  1993; Adams,  2007).
1: Quantification of each compound was performed on the basis of their GC-FID peak areas on the two columns, using the normalization procedure without corrections for response factor.
