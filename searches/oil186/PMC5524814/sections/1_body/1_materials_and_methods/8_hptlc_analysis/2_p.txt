0: Test solutions were the hydroethanolic and dichlorometane extracts.
1: Aliquots of 4 L of test and reference solutions were applied on the plates as bands of 8 mm in length (distance from the left edge 15 mm and from the lower edge 8 mm).
2: Plates were developed in ascending mode over a distance of 6 cm from the application position using a twin-through chamber fitted with filter paper previously saturated for 20 min with the mobile phase.
3: Analyses were carried out at constant humidity (33%) at room temperature (23  2C).
4: Two mobile phases were used depending on the test solutions analyzed: ethyl acetate, acetic acid, formic acid, water (100:10:10:25) for hydroethanolic extracts, and toluene, ethyl acetate, formic acid (70:30:1) for dichloromethane extracts.
