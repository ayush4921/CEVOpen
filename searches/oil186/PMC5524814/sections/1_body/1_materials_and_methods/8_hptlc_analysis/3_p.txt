0: Derivatization of the plates was carried out by dipping with either the Natural Products Reagent (NPR) and the PEG-400 solution (hydroethanolic extracts), or the anisaldehyde solution (dichloromethane extracts).
1: In the case of hydroethanolic extracts, after elution, the plates were dried in cold air for 5 min, heated at 100C for 3 min and dipped in the NPR solution (1 g of diphenylboric acid aminoethyl ester in 200 mL of ethyl acetate) while still hot.
2: Once the plates were dried, they were subsequently dipped in the PEG-400 solution (10 g of PEG 400 in 200 mL of dichloromethane) and dried.
3: Evaluation was performed under UV light at 366 nm.
4: In the case of dichloromethane extracts, plates were immersed in anisaldehyde solution, prepared according to the European Pharmacopoeia (EDQM,  2016), and heated at 100C for 5 min.
5: They were examined immediately in daylight and eventually under UV light at 366 nm.
