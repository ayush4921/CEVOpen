0: Other researchers studied the chemical composition of pumpkin seed oils from  C. pepo [ 5, 18, 19, 20, 21].
1: Due to the differences among the species and/or varieties of  Cucurbita spp.
2: grown in different areas of the world, the present study focused on characterizing a native Italian cultivar ( C. maxima, var.
3: Berrettina, locally known as priests hat), paying attention to the lipid composition of the seed oil.
4: Since there is little information about the lipid structure, the present research deepens understanding of the total FA content and intrapositional composition of Berrettina pumpkin by using stereospecific analysis, and pays attention to other minor lipid components such as sterols, alcohols, and carotenoids.
5: Butinar et al.
6: [ 22] proposed high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of triacylglycerol (TAG) as a useful technique to evaluate the genuineness of pumpkin seed oils produced in Slovenia, but to the best of our knowledge, there are no data in the literature dealing with stereospecific analysis of pumpkin seed TAG.
