0: Stevenson et al.
1: [ 14] summarized FA composition and reported significant differences among various cultivars of pumpkin seed oil extracted from various pumpkin sources.
2: Rezig et al.
3: [ 15] studied the chemical composition and oil properties of seeds of a Tunisian variety of pumpkin, Bejaoui ( C. maxima).
4: They found that the major FA were oleic, linoleic, and palmitic acids and that the seed oil was rich in -tocopherol, while the sterol marker was -sitosterol and the predominant phenolic acid was syringic acid.
5: Siano et al.
6: [ 16] highlighted that saturated FA (SFA) and monounsaturated FA (MUFA) of  C. maxima produced in southern Italy showed similar values (25.20% and 25.54%, respectively), while the polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) content was 48.14%.
7: Habib et al.
8: [ 17] determined the proximate composition of powdered seed and the lipid composition of the oil of  C. maxima collected in Bangladesh.
9: They affirmed that the high degree of unsaturation makes the oil suitable for use as valuable drying agent, and lower free FA content indicates suitability of the oil for consumption as food.
