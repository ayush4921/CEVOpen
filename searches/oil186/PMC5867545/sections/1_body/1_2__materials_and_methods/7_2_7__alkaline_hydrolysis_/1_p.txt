0: Alkaline hydrolysis of pumpkin seed oil was carried out according to the method reported by Cossignani et al.
1: [ 27].
2: Prior to alkaline hydrolysis, 0.2% 5--cholestane in CHCl 3 and 1% 1-octacosanol (used as internal standards) were added to the oil samples, then the American Oil Chemists Society (AOCS) method (Ch 691) was used [ 28].
3: The products obtained after alkaline reaction were applied to TLC silica gel plates previously treated with 0.2 N KOH in MeOH, then activated for 1 h at 100 C. The developing system was hexane/diethyl ether (65:35,  v/v).
4: The band containing the sterols, visualized with 2,7-dichlorofluorescein spray, was scraped off and extracted with CHCl 3.
5: Then the solvent was evaporated and removed under nitrogen stream.
