0: The FAME of TAG,  sn-2-MAG, and  sn-1,2-PA fractions were prepared by transesterification.
1: Hexane and 2 N methanolic KOH were added to the fraction and stirred for 3 min, then water was added.
2: The organic phase (upper) containing the FAME was dried over anhydrous Na 2SO 4, then analyzed by HRGC.
3: A DANI GC1000 DPC gas chromatograph (Norwalk, CT, USA) equipped with a split-splitless injector and a flame ionization detector (FID) was used.
4: Separation was obtained using the CP-Select CB for FAME fused silica capillary column (50 m  0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 m f.t.
5: ; Varian, Superchrom, Milan, Italy).
6: Chromatograms were acquired and processed using Clarity integration software (DataApex Ltd., Prague, Czech Republic).
7: The injector and detector temperature was 250 C. The oven temperature was held at 180 C for 6 min, and raised to 250 C at 3 C/min; the final temperature was held for 10 min.
8: Carrier gas (He) flow rate was 1 mL/min; the injection volume was 1 L with a split ratio of 1:70.
9: A standard solution containing 37 FAME was used to identify the individual FA.
10: The percentage of each FA was calculated using the peak area of the samples.
11: The data were normalized considering only the main reported FA (% mol mean values 0.1).
