0: An aliquot of TAG was dissolved in anhydrous diethyl ether, and freshly prepared ethyl magnesium bromide in anhydrous diethyl ether was added.
1: The mixture was shaken, and then pentane (0.1% acetic acid) and water were added.
2: The solution was vortexed and centrifuged (ALC 4218 centrifuge, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
3: The water was removed and the organic phase was dried over anhydrous Na 2SO 4 and concentrated with solvent removal under nitrogen stream.
4: The DAG mixture was applied to TLC plates previously treated with 5% boric acid solution (methanol/water, 80:20,  v/v) and then activated for 1 h at 120 C. The developing system was hexane/diethyl ether (60:40,  v/v).
5: The band containing the  sn-1,2(2,3)-DAG fraction (Rf  0.30; Rf of the  sn-1,3-DAG band  0.35), located by iodine vapor exposition, was scraped off and extracted with diethyl ether.
