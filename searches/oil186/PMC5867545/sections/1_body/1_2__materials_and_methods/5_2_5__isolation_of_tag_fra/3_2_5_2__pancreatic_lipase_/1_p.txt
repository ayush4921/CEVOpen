0: Hydrolysis of TAG was carried out according to the method provided by the Italian fat and derivate control standards (Norme Italiane per il Controllo dei Grassi e Derivati (NGD) method) [ 26].
1: Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.08), bile salts, CaCl 2, and pancreatic lipase were added to an aliquot of TAG.
2: The mixture was incubated under magnetic stirring in a water bath at 40 C for 5 min, and then 6 M HCl and diethyl ether were added and the mixture was centrifuged.
3: Diethyl ether was dried by anhydrous Na 2SO 4 and evaporated under nitrogen flow to small volume.
4: The hydrolytic products were separated on TLC plates, and the developing solvent system was petroleum ether/diethyl ether/formic acid (70:30:1,  v/v/v).
5: The band corresponding to  sn-2-monoacylglycerols ( sn-2-MAG), visualized with 2,7-dichlorofluorescein spray, was scraped off, methylated, and analyzed by HRGC as reported in  Section 2.6 to obtain the constituent FAME.
6: The obtained data represent the intrapositional composition of FA esterified in  sn-2 position, named A 2.
