0: The TAG fraction was isolated by thin layer chromatography (TLC), according to the method described by Cossignani et al.
1: [ 24], from total fat of pumpkin seed samples using silica gel plates (SIL G-25, 0.25 mm, 20 cm  20 cm; Macherey-Nagel, Germany) and petroleum ether/diethyl ether/formic acid (70:30:1,  v/v/v) as a developing solvent.
2: The TAG fraction was scraped off, extracted with hexane/diethyl ether (1:1,  v/v), subjected to transesterification, and analyzed by high-resolution gas chromatography (HRGC) as reported in  Section 2.6 to obtain the constituent fatty acid methyl esters (FAME).
3: The obtained data represent the total composition of FA esterified in all 3  sn-positions of TAG, named A t.
