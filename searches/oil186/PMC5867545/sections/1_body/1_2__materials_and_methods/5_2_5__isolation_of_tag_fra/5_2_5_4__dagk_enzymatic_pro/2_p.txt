0: The FA composition at the  sn-1- and  sn-3-positions was obtained applying the following formulas: A  1 = 2A  1,2  A  2(1)A  3 = 3A  t  A  2  A  1(2) where A 1 = % intrapositional composition of FA esterified in  sn-1 position; A 1,2 = % intrapositional composition of FA esterified in  sn-1 and  sn-2 positions; A 2 = % intrapositional composition of FA esterified in  sn-2 position; A t = % total composition of FA esterified in all 3  sn-positions of TAG; A 3 = % intrapositional composition of FA esterified in  sn-3 position.
