0: The  sn-1,2(2,3)-DAG ethereal solution was concentrated under nitrogen stream, then cardiolipin solution, buffered  sn-1,2-DAGK, buffer, and Na 2ATP were added, mixing each time.
1: After incubation at 40 C for 90 min under constant stirring, chloroform/methanol (2:1,  v/v) was added to the mixture to stop the reaction and extract the products of interest.
2: The combined extracts were concentrated, treated with anhydrous Na 2SO 4, and applied to TLC plates.
3: The developing system was chloroform/methanol/25% ammonia (65:25:5,  v/v/v).
4: The band of the  sn-1,2-phosphatidic acids ( sn-1,2-PA), visualized with 2,7-dichlorofluorescein spray (Rf  0.1), was scraped off, methylated, and analyzed by HRGC with flame ionization detection (FID) as reported in the following paragraph to obtain the constituent FAME.
5: The obtained data represent the intrapositional composition of FA esterified in  sn-1,2 positions, named A 1,2.
