0: Medicinal plants have been used for a long time as sources of new pharmaceuticals due to the presence of bioactive compounds [ 1].
1: Plants are rich in structurally diverse secondary metabolites displaying a wide range of biological activities, including possible leads for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases [ 2, 3].
2: Natural products have contributed greatly as sources for drug discovery for Alzheimers disease [ 4].
3: Earlier studies have shown that the maintenance of correct levels of acetylcholinesterases is directly related to different diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), bipolar disorder, depression, and schizophrenia [ 5].
4: There are two distinct basic types of cholinesterases: acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE).
5: The main physiological function of AChE is the splitting of acetylcholine (ACh), a mediator of cholinergic synapses, during the transduction of nerve impulses [ 6].
