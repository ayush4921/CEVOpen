0: The anti-AChE activity of the essential oils of  Eryngium campestre and  Eryngium amethystine, two species of the Apiaceae family, is described in the work conducted by Cianfaglione et al.
1: [ 11], showing that the inhibitory activity is very low (10.5% at 19.5 mg/mL) compared to the commercial inhibitor galanthamine.
2: The activity was expressed as galanthamine equivalent inhibitory activity and the dose tested is similar to an inhibition exerted by 3 g/mL of the positive control galanthamine.
3: Likewise, the essential oil of  Daucus aristidis (Apiaceae) tested against AChE and BChE enzymes, by the Ellman method, at a concentration of 100 g/mL appeared to have a moderate level of inhibitory effect (between 13% to 50%) against both enzymes as compared to that of galanthamine.
4: The moderate AChE inhibitory activity of  Daucus aristidis essential oil could be explained by the highest concentration of its individual components, - and -pinene (over 70%) [ 12].
