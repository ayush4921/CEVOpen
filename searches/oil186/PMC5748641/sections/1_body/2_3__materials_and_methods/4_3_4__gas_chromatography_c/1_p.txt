0: The chemical constituents of the  Niphogeton dissecta essential oil were analyzed on an Agilent Technologies 6890N gas chromatograph, coupled to a 5973N mass spectrometer (Santa Clara, CA, USA) and equipped with a DB-5MS capillary column (5%-phenyl-methylpolysiloxane, 30 m, 0.25 mm internal diameter., 0.25 m film thickness; J & W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA).
1: For the separation of the volatile constituents, the following temperature program was used: 5 min at 60 C, 3 C/min up to 165 C, 15 C/min up to 250 C, and held for 10 min.
2: The injector and detector temperatures were kept at 220 C. The carrier gas was helium, at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.
3: The injector was operated in split mode, with a split ratio of 1:50.
4: The acquisition mass range was set at 40350  m/ z. Ionization mode: electron-impact (70 eV).
5: The essential oil was diluted 1:100  v/ v in dichloromethane (Fisher Scientific, 99.9% purity) and 1 L of the solution was injected.
