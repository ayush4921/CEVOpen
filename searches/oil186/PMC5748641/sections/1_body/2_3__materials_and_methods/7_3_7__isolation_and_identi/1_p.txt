0: The essential oil of  N. dissecta (5 g) was subjected to column chromatography over a silica gel G60 column, applying an oil/silica weight ratio of 1:200, with a mixture of Hex:AcOEt 90:10 (isocratic elution), obtaining a total of five fractions and affording acorenone B as a pure compound (1.48 g).
1: The identification was performed by spectroscopic techniques such as EI-MS,  1H, and  13C NMR.
2: 1H and  13C NMR spectra were acquired using a VARIAN NMR spectrometer (400 MHz for  1H and 100 MHz for  13C), tetramethylsilane was used as an internal standard, and chemical shifts are given in  (ppm).
