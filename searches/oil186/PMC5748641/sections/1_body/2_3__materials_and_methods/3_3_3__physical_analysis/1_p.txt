0: The relativity density ( d20) was determined using a 1-cm 3 pycnometer.
1: The refractive index ( n20) was measured by an Abbe's refractometer, manufactured by Boeco, Germany.
2: The specific optical rotation  []D20 was determined in a Hanon P 810 automatic polarimeter.
3: All these properties were expressed as mean values and standard deviations of four measurements.
