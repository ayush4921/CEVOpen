0: The cholinesterase (ChE) activities were assayed following a colorimetric protocol adapted from Ellman et al.
1: [ 43, 44].
2: ChEs efficiently catalyze the hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine (ATCh), the sulfur analog of the natural substrate of these enzymes.
3: Upon hydrolysis, this substrate analog produces acetate ion and thiocholine.
4: Thiocholine, in the presence of the highly reactive dithiobisnitrobenzoate (DTNB) ion, generates a yellow color, which can be quantitatively monitored by spectrophotometric absorption at 412 nm.
5: All reagents were obtained from the Sigma-Aldrich trading house.
6: A typical 200 L inhibition assay volume contained phosphate buffered saline solution (pH 7.4), DTNB (1.5 mM), test sample in DMSO (1%  v/v final).
7: Both acetylcholinesterase from  Electrophorus electricus (Type V-S, lyophilized powder, 744 U/mg solid, 1 272 U/mg protein) and butyrylcholinesterase from equine serum (lyophilized powder, 900 units/mg protein) were dissolved in PBS pH 7.4 and used at 25 mU/mL for the assay.
8: After 10 min of pre-incubation, the substrate acetylthiocholine iodide (1.5 mM) was added to start the reaction.
9: During 1 h of incubation at 30 C, 96-well microtiter multiplates were read on a PherastarFS (BMG Labtech) detection system.
10: All measurements were made in triplicate.
11: When possible, the IC 50 values were calculated using the GNUPLOT package on line ( www.ic50.tk,  www.gnuplot.info).
12: Donepezil was used as reference ChE inhibitor with an IC 50 = 100 nM for AChE and 8500 nM for BChE.
13: In this assay, we did not exclude the possibility of false-positive inhibition results previously described for high concentrations (>100 g/mL) of amine or aldehyde compounds [ 45, 46], but the lack of inhibition observed for the essential oil versus the AChE strongly minimized this possibility.
