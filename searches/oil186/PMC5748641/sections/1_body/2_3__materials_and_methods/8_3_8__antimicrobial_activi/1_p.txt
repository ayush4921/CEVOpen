0: Five pathogenic bacteria (ATCC):  Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923,  E. faecalis ATCC 29212,  Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853,  Escherichia coli ATCC 25922,  Proteus vulgaris ATCC 8427, and  Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 9997 were included in the investigation.
1: For all bacteria, except for  E. faecalis, a heart-heart infusion broth (BHI-DIFCO, DIFCO, Sparks, MD, USA) was used.
2: All the strains were maintained at 80 C until use, when they were withdrawn to prepare overnight cultures at 37 C for 16 h. MIC values were determined by the micro-dilution broth method, using a final concentration of 5/105 CFU/mL.
3: DMSO solutions of the sample were prepared at a concentration of 20 mg/mL.
4: Assays were carried out in 96-well plates and a two-fold serial dilution was used to obtain decreasing concentrations from 1000 to 0.024 mg/mL.
5: The incubation was performed at 37 C for 24 h. Gentamicin was used a positive control with an MIC value of 0.40 mg/mL, except for  E. faecalis where ampicillin (MIC 1.56 mg/mL) was used.
