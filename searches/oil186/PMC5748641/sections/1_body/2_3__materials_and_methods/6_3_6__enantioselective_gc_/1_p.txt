0: Enantioselective GC-MS analysis was performed with the same Agilent Technologies instrument previously described.
1: The mass spectrometer operated in electron impact ionization mode at 70 eV, with a mass range of  m/ z 40350 full scan mode.
2: The ion source temperature was set at 220 C. Helium was the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min.
3: The injector was operated in split mode (1:40) at 200 C, with the transfer line at 230 C. The oven thermal program was as follows: 60 C for 2 min, then the temperature was raised to 220 C with a gradient rate of 2 C/min and held at 220 C for 2 min.
4: A chiral capillary column based on diethyl tertbutylsilyl-BETA-cyclodextrin (25m  0.25mm  film thickness 0.25 m) from Mega (Legnano, MI, Italy) was used.
5: The essential oil was diluted 5:100 ( v/ v) in dichloromethane (Fisher Scientific, 99.9% purity) and 1 L of the solution was injected.
6: Enantiomerically pure standards, used to determine the elution order of enantiomers, were available in one of the authors' laboratory (C.B.
7: ).
