0:  CHO-K1 cell viability after treatment with different concentrations of EOP.
1: Cell proliferation in CHO-K1 was investigated by the MTT assay, and metronidazole was used as a positive control.
2: Data are expressed as the mean  SEM of the viabilities of CHO-K1 cells in three independent experiments.
3: (*) indicates a difference between the treatments in CHO-K1 cells.
4: The differences were considered significant at p< 0.05.
5: VC = vehicle control; MTZ = metronidazole. )
