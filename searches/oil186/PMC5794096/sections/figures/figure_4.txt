0:  Anti-rCP40 total IgG (4A), IgG1 (4B) and IgG2a (4C) levels in immunized mice treated with EOP and recombinant endoglycosidase CP40 from C. pseudotuberculosis (rCP40), either separately or together.
1: Measurements were taken on day 0 and then 21 and 42 days post-immunization.
2: Data represent means  standard deviations of IgG levels in the sera collected from 6 animals/group.
3: Different letters in the same experimental day indicate a significant difference (p< 0.05). )
