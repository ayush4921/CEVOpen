0: On the other hand, studies focusing on essential oils of propolis volatiles are relatively scarce, most of them dealing with antimicrobial properties against fungus, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [ 29].
1: Volatiles of propolis from stingless bees were able to stimulate the immune system of elderly patients by increasing their natural killer cell activity [ 30].
2: Essential oils of Chinese propolis inhibited the proliferation of human colorectal cancer cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [ 31].
3: However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies describing the chemical composition or the biological activities of the essential oil derived from the Brazilian red propolis (EOP).
4: Herein, the chemical composition of the EOP is showed.
5: Still, in vitro trichomonacidal and cytotoxic activities, and the adjuvant action of EOP in a recombinant vaccine are assessed.
