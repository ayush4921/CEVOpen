0: Currently, the Brazilian propolis is classified in 13 different types, according to its physical-chemical properties, botanical origin and geographic area where propolis can be collected.
1: Initially, Park et al.
2: [ 1] classified propolis samples from different Brazilian regions in 12 groups.
3: Afterwards, a 13 th type of propolis with peculiar chemical composition was found in hives located alongside the coast and mangroves in the Brazilian northeast and was called Brazilian red propolis (BRP) [ 2].
4: In the last decade, the chemical composition of BRP has been revealed and related to its bioactivities.
5: The main chemical components found in BRP are classified as isoflavones, flavones, flavonols, aurones, chalcones, pterocarpans and xanthones groups [ 3 6].
6: The botanical origin of BRP was identified as resinous exudates of  Dalbergia ecastophyllum [ 7], however, likely a second plant species participates as one of the main sources of resins for BRP [ 5].
