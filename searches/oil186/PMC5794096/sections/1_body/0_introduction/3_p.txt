0: Several experiments and clinical investigations have shown the antiparasitic and adjuvant properties of the hydroalcoholic extract of propolis (HEP).
1: HEP of different types of propolis showed antiparasitary efficacy against  Giardia lamblia [ 20, 21],  Toxoplasma gondii and  Trichomonas vaginalis [ 22].
2: It is important to highlight that  T.  vaginalis is the etiological agent of trichomoniasis, the most common non-viral, sexually transmitted disease (STD) in the world [ 23].
3: In addition, metronidazole-resistant T. vaginalis has been implicated in an increasing number of refractory cases, which are usually treated with increased doses of the drug, leading to an increase in the occurrence of side effects [ 24].
4: Clearly, alternative curative therapies are needed, and propolis emerges as a natural product for alternative drugs.
