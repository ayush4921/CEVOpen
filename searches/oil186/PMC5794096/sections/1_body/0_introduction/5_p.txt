0: As aforementioned, most of the previous studies describing the biological activities of BRP uses ethanol as the extraction solvent, and the extraction method influences directly the yield and selectivity for some compounds [ 10, 28].
1: Volatile compounds like those found in essential oils are in low concentrations in propolis, but play an important role by contributing to propolis pleasant aroma and its biological activities.
2: Researchers have applied various methods to obtain propolis volatiles such as distilllation-extraction or hydrodistillation [ 29].
