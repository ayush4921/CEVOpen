0: The post-treatment proliferation of the CHO-K1 cell line was determined by measuring the reduction of soluble 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma-Aldrich) to water-insoluble formazan.
1: Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 2  10 4 cells per well in 100 L volumes and grown at 37 C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere for 24 h before they were used in the cell viability assay.
2: The cells were then treated with 31.25, 62.5, 125, 250 and 500 g of EOP for 24 h. DMSO was used as vehicle control (VC), untreated cells were used as a negative control and 100 M of metronidazole (MTZ) was used as a positive control.
3: Following the incubation, 20 L of MTT (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each well and the cells were incubated for an additional period of 3 h at 37 C. Differences in the total cellular metabolism were detected at a wavelength of 492 nm by using a microplate reader.
4: The inhibition (%) of cell proliferation was determined as follows: inhibitory growth = (1  Abs 492 treated cells / Abs 492 control cells)  100%.
5: The IC 50 was calculated using GraphPad Prism version 5.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, USA).
6: All observations were validated by at least three independent experiments in triplicate.
