0: To determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), different concentrations of EOP (25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 g/mL) were tested as described by Hubner et al.
1: [ 33], with some modification.
2: Parasite pellets were used to establish the MIC as well as concentrations below and above the MIC value.
3: Samples used as controls were inoculated in fresh TYM medium at 37 C. Parasites were counted in a Neubauer chamber with trypan blue every 24 h for 96 h to confirm MIC.
4: The viability of trophozoites was assessed by the exclusion of the trypan blue dye as well as by motility and morphology.
5: The IC 50 (half the maximum inhibitory concentration) values were determined at the same concentrations used for the MIC test.
