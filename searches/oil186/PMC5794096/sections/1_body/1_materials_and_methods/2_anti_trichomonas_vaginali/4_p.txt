0: A kinetic growth curve was constructed in order to obtain a more comparable activity profile of EOP activity against  T.  vaginalis.
1: The viability of trophozoites was observed under a light microscope 96 h after incubation with EOP at the required MIC.
2: Growth analysis was performed at 1, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h by the trypan blue (0.4%) exclusion method and by the evaluation of motility and morphology.
3: All assays were performed independently at least three times in triplicate, and the results were expressed as the percentage of viable trophozoites compared to untreated parasites.
