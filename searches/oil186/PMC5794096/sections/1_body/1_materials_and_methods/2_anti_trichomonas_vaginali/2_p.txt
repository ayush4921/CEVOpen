0: All assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates (Cral ).
1: Parasites were seeded at an initial density of 2.6  10 5 trophozoites/mL of TYM and incubated in the presence of EOP.
2: Three experimental controls were also performed: parasites only, the vehicle used for solubilization of EOP (0.6% DMSO) and 100 M MTZ (metronidazole; Sigma-Aldrich) (as a positive control).
3: The microculture plates were incubated at 37 C with 5% CO 2 for 24 h. Subsequent to the incubation, a preparation containing trophozoites and trypan blue (0.4%) in a 1:1 ratio was prepared and counted in a Neubauer chamber.
4: Cultures with 95% viability were utilized for the assay.
