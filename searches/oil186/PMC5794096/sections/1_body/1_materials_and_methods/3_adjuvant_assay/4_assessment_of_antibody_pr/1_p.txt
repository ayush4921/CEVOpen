0: Serum samples from the immunized mice were used in immunoassays (indirect ELISA) for the quantification of total IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a anti-rCP40 antibodies.
1: Polystyrene 96-well plates (Maxisorp-Nunc) were coated with 100 L of a bicarbonate-carbonate buffer (pH 9.8) containing 0.1 g/well of rCP40 protein.
2: Plates were incubated for 18 h at 4 C and washed 3 times with PBS-T (PBS 1X, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween 20).
3: The plates were then incubated with 200 L/well of 5% skim milk in PBS for 2 h at 37 C, for blocking purposes.
4: A three-step wash was then performed.
5: All serum samples obtained from mice were diluted in PBS (v/v 1:50), and 100 L of each diluted sample was added to the plates in duplicate.
6: Plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 C. After washing three times with PBS-T, 100 L/well of anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich) was added (1: 5,000 in PBS-T) to the plates in order to detect total IgG prior to the revelation step.
7: In plates designated for the detection of IgG1 and IgG2a, 100 L/well of either goat anti-mouse IgG1 (1: 5,000 in PBS-T) or goat anti-mouse IgG2a (1: 2,000 in PBS-T) was added.
8: The plates were incubated at 37 C for 1 h and then washed three times with PBS-T, subsequent to which 100 L/well of anti-goat IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich) was added (1: 5,000 in PBS-T).
9: The plates were re-incubated for 1 h at 37 C and then washed five times with PBS-T.
10: The reaction was developed by the addition of 100 L/well of the substrate-chromogen solution [ o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride; OPD tablets (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.4 mg/mL phosphate-citrate buffer containing 0.04% of 30% hydrogen peroxide, pH = 5.0] and incubation at room temperature in the dark for 15 min, and it was stopped by the addition of 50 L/well of H 2SO 4 solution (4N).
11: Optical density (OD) was determined using a microtiter-plate reader (Microplate Reader Mindray MR96A) set at 492 nm.
