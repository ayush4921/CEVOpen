0: The recombinant endoglycosidase CP40 (rCP40), derived from  C.  pseudotuberculosis, was used as an antigen for the adjuvant assay.
1: The pAE/ cp40 recombinant plasmid previously constructed by our group [ 34] was transformed into the  Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) Star strain by the heat shock method.
2: The induction of expression was performed by adding 1 mM of IPTG followed by incubation at 37 C for 3 h with constant agitation.
3: Western blotting using a monoclonal anti-6x-His-tag antibody conjugated to peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to confirm rCP40 expression.
4: A sepharose-nickel column, HisTrapTM (GE Healthcare), was used for purification of the recombinant protein.
5: Purity was determined by 12% SDS-PAGE, and the concentration was measured using a BCA kit (PIERCE).
