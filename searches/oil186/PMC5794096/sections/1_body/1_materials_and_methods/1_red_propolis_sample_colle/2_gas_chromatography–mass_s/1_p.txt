0: Chemical composition analysis was performed using a gas chromatograph coupled with a mass-selective detector (Hewlett Packard 6890/MSD5973, Palo Alto, USA) equipped with the HP ChemStation software and the Wiley 275 library.
1: A capillary column composed of HP-INNOWax fused silica (30 m  250 m) of 0.50 m film thickness (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, USA) was used for the study.
2: The temperature program used was as follows: the column temperature started at 40 C (held for 8 min) and was increased to 180 C at 3 C/min and then to 230 C (held for 20 min) at 20 C/min; the injector was at a temperature of 250 C and the interface at 280 C. The split ratio was 1:100, helium was the carrier gas (56 kPa), the flow rate was 1 mL/min, the ionization energy was 70 eV, and the injected volume was 0.4 mL.
