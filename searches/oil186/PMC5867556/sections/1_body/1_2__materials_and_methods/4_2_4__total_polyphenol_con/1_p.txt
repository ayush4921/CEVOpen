0: Phenolic compounds are oxidized by Folin-Ciocalteau reactive (Sigma-Aldrich) and the blue colour produced presents a maximum absorption at 750 nm evaluated by a spectrophotometer against a specific blank.
1: Briefly, 20 L of the propolis extracts was added to 380 L of ethanol and 100 L of the Folin-Ciocalteau reagent.
2: Then, 200 L of a saturated sodium carbonate solution and 4.3 mL water were added.
3: The tubes were then allowed to stand at room temperature for 60 min before measuring the absorbance at 750 nm against the blank.
4: The total polyphenolic content was expressed as galangin equivalents in %  w/ w or mg/mL.
5: The concentration of polyphenols in the samples was derived from a standard curve of galangin ranging from 5 to 60 g (correlation coefficient > of 0.9890).
