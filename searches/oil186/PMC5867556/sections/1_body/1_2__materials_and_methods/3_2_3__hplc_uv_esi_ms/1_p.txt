0: The high-performance liquid chromatography equipment was from Jasco (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) (pump mod.
1: PU-1580, UV detector UV-1570, Rheodyne injector equipped with a 20 L loop, software Jasco-Borwin rel.
2: 1.5).
3: The phenolic acids and flavonoids from propolis were separated using a 250  4.6-mm stainless-steel column Discovery-C18 4 m 80 A (from Sigma-Aldrich).
4: The eluents were (A) 0.5% acetic acid and (B) acetonitrile.
5: Separations were performed at room temperature by solvent gradient elution from 0 min at 50% A/50% B to 60 min at 100% B at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min.
6: A UV detector set at 260 nm was also used on-line with HPLC equipment.
