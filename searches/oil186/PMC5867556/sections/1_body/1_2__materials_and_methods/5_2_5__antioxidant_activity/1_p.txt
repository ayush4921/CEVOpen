0: The radical scavenging effect on 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) molecules was evaluated according to the method of Banskota and others [ 12] with slight modifications.
1: Samples were dissolved in a buffer solution at a final concentration of 1 g/mL or final dilution of 1 L/mL.
2: For each extract, a series of test tubes were prepared containing between 1 and 1000 L of these solutions, and the volume completed to 1000 L with buffer.
3: Finally, 1 mL of a 500 M DPPH solution was added to each tube.
4: After 30 min of incubation at room temperature in the dark, the absorbance was recorded at 517 nm by a spectrophotometer.
5: Results are expressed in terms of the percentage of decrease with respect to control values (absorbance of 1 mL DPPH solution + 1 mL of buffer) incubated under the same conditions.
6: Readings were made in triplicate.
7: The mean of each result is plotted on a graph constructed by plotting increasing concentrations of the antioxidant trolox (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid) vs. Optical Density (OD) values.
8: Propolis samples antioxidant activity is expressed as g trolox equivalent.
