0: The variations in the chemical composition and consequently in the biological activity of propolis, are associated with its type and geographic origin.
1: However, although propolis is a complex mixture, its biological activities are reported due to the presence of the flavonoids, phenolic acids, and ethers mainly obtained from plant-derived substances [ 5].
2: Hence, although propolis is obviously an animal product, a considerable proportion of its components responsible for biological activities are plant derived.
3: In fact, the resin contains most of the compounds found in extracts consumed by people from many countries as food complements, nutraceuticals, or alternative medicine.
4: In fact, propolis has been extensively used in folk medicine for many years, and there is substantial evidence to indicate that it has antiseptic, antifungal, antibacterical, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties [ 4, 5, 6, 7].
5: Current applications of propolis include over-the-counter preparations for cold syndrome (upper respiratory tract infections, common cold, flu-like infection), as well as dermatological preparations useful in wound healing, treatment of boils, acne, herpes simplex and genitalis, and neurodermatitis, among other ailments [ 4, 8].
6: These effects are exerted by the numerous, more than 300, known substances composing propolis [ 9].
