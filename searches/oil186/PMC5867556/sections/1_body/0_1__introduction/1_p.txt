0: Propolis is a complex material of resinous consistency produced by bees which has a highly variable physical appearance, color, and consistency, depending on many factors such as geographic origin, types of vegetable sources, time of collection, and season of the year [ 1].
1: Bees use propolis to seal openings in the hive to avoid the entrance of intruders, to maintain a constant inner temperature, to contribute to the attainment of an internal aseptic environment, and overall to protect the hive from widespread bacterial infection [ 1, 2, 3, 4].
2: Propolis composition is extremely complex and variable, showing the presence of beeswax, resin, essential oils, and pollen.
3: Bees secrete the wax, while resin and oils are obtained from plants, usually taken from secretions or by cutting fragments of vegetative tissues.
