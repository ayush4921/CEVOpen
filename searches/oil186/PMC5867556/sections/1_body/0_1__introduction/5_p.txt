0: In this paper, we evaluated this aspect by dissolving a unique propolis extract in various solvents obtaining different finished products such as hydroalcoholic, glycolic, glyceric solutions, and oil, as well as a product in the form of powder.
1: The molecular composition of the different preparations was evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography-UV-electrospray ionization mass (HPLC-UV-ESI-MS) and the antioxidant activity determined by a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) anti-oxidant assay [ 12].
2: This is more important by considering that the finished products in various forms often require propolis dissolved in specific solvents and supporting matrixes.
3: Finally, up to now, very few data are available on propolis composition in glyceric and glycolic extracts and no information has ever been published on propolis in oil.
