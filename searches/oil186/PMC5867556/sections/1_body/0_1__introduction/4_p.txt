0: Due to the very high molecular complex composition of propolis, the different extractive processes utilized and the various solvents available to produce the finished products, the evaluation of the total polyphenols extracted, as well as an accurate determination of the single species and of the derived families of compounds with similar chemical properties, are necessary to assure products rich in molecular species and still retaining biological properties.
1: In fact, despite the high number of compounds extracted, the yield of the extraction process is often lower, which could indicate a selectivity depending on the extractive process.
2: Moreover, the different solvents used to solubilize the extracted polyphenols from propolis may have a selective capacity to produce finished products which possess peculiar compositions and biological properties.
