0: Propolis, which is barely soluble in water, cannot be used as a raw material and it must be purified by extraction with solvents to remove the inert material and preserve the polyphenolic fraction.
1: These last compounds, flavonoids and phenolic acids, are considered to contribute more to the healing effects than the other propolis constituents [ 9].
2: Propolis extracts are more commonly obtained through conventional techniques, such as ethanolic or aqueous extraction or by Soxhlet [ 10, 11].
3: In fact, in commercial and supplemental health care products, propolis is added in the form of extracts which are obtained by soaking crushed propolis in organic solvent or water.
4: Moreover, in the last few years, different studies have shown the extraction with supercritical fluid as a possible alternative method to obtain compounds derived from natural matrices, including propolis [ 10].
