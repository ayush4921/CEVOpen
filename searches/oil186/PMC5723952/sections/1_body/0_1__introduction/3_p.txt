0: Few studies on biochemical properties of  Rudbeckia varieties are reported [ 10].
1: Thus, leaf essential oils from three herbaceous members of the Asteraceae family,  Rudbeckia fulgida,  Rudbeckia hirta, and  Symphyotrichum novae-angliae, were obtained by hydrodistillation and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
2: The main components in the essential oil of  Rudbeckia fulgida were found to be the sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (germacrene D (30.1%) and -cadinene (17.8%)); similar composition was reported in the case of leaf oil of  Rudbeckia hirta, with 23.6% germacrene D and 16.2% -cadinene.
3: The leaf oils of these extracts were found to be inactive for antimicrobial activity [ 11].
4: Another study reports the chemical composition, minerals, and antioxidative effect of  Rudbeckia laciniata [ 12].
5: General component of  Rudbeckia laciniata is crude protein.
6: The highest content of minerals is potassium, followed by calcium and magnesium, suggesting that  Rudbeckia laciniata was alkaline material.
7: The content of total phenolic and flavonoid compounds and DPPH radical scavenging activity of  Rudbeckia laciniata were also reported.
8: The chemical profile of  Rudbeckia hirta was established by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) technique and by means of the total content of polyphenols [ 13].
9: As about the therapeutic actions of the species of the genus  Rudbeckia, they are relatively varied.
10: The active compounds or extracts of these plants exhibit anti-inflammatory effects ( Rudbeckia hirta) [ 14,  15], antimycobacterial ( Rudbeckia subtomentosa) [ 16], antileukemic ( Rudbeckia mollis) [ 17], antitussive ( Rudbeckia fulgida) [ 18], antioxidant, antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, and cytotoxic activities ( Rudbeckia laciniata) [ 19].
