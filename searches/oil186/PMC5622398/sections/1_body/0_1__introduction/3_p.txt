0: EOs are volatile liquids, or semi-liquids, extracted from plants, usually by steam distillation [ 4].
1: They are limpid and rarely coloured, are soluble in organic solvents with a lower density than that of water, and are lipid soluble.
2: They can be synthesized by all plant organs (flowers, leaves, stems, twigs, seeds, fruits, roots, wood, or bark) and are stored in secretory cells, cavities, canals, epidermic cells or glandular trichomes.
3: EOs are complex mixtures of sesquiterpene and monoterpene hydrocarbons and alcohols, ketones, and aldehydes (their oxygenated derivatives).
4: Essential oils may also encompass other chemical families like fatty acids, oxides, and sulphur derivatives [ 5].
