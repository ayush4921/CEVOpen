0: Leukocytes were obtained from the peritoneal cavity of mice 4 hours after injection of zymosan solutions (1 mg/cavity, i.p.).
1: Briefly, the cells (5  10 5 cells/well) were exposed to LEO at concentrations of 0.5, 1, 3, 10, 30, or 90  g/mL for 90 min (37C/CO 2 5%).
2: A volume of 10  L of MTT (5 mg/mL, Sigma) was added to each well.
3: After 2 h, 150  L of supernatant was removed, and 100  l of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to each well, and absorbance was measured using a Biochrom Asys Expert plus microplate reader (Asys) at a wavelength of 540 nm, as previously described [ 22].
4: The percentage of viability was determined by the following formula: (1)%  viable  cells=absorbance  of  the  treated  cellsabsorbance  of  the  blankabsorbance  of  the  controlabsorbance  of  the  control100.
