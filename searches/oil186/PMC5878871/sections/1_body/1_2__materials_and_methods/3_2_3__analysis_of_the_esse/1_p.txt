0: The LEO was analyzed using gas chromatography- (GC-) mass spectrometry (MS).
1: GC was performed with a Thermo Electron Corporation Focus GC model under the following conditions: DB-5 capillary column (30 m  0.32 mm, 0.25 mm); column temperature, 60C (1 min) to 180C at 3C/min; injector temperature, 220C; detector temperature, 220C; split ratio, 1 : 10; carrier gas, He; flow rate, 1.0 mL/min.
2: An injection volume of 1  L was diluted in acetone (1 : 10).
3: The retention index (RI) was calculated relative to a series of the  n-alkanes (C 8C 40, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) on DB-5 column, using the Van den Dool and Kratz equation [ 20,  21].
