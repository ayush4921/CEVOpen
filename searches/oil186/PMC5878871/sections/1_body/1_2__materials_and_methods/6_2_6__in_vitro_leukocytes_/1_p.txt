0: Leukocytes were obtained by the method described above.
1: The chemotaxis assay was performed using a 48-well microchemotaxis plate (Neuro Probe), in which the chambers were separated by a polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate membrane (5  m pore size).
2: LEO (used as chemoattractant) at concentrations of 2, 15, or 150  g/mL or RPMI 1640 medium (control) was placed in the lower chamber.
3: A leukocyte suspension (1  10 6 cells/mL, in RPMI 1640 medium) was placed in the upper chamber.
4: The chambers were incubated (37C/CO 2 5%) for 1 h and the membrane was stained with Instant Prov.
5: Cells present in the membrane were counted in five random fields from each well, using light microscopy, as previously described [ 22].
6: The results are expressed as the mean number of leukocytes per field.
