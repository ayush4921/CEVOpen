0: Ear edema was induced by topical application of croton oil (200  g 20/ear) diluted in 20  l of acetone/water solution (vehicle) in the inner surface of the mouse right ear.
1: The left ear received an equal volume of vehicle ( n = 57 animals/group).
2: LEO (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2.5 mg/ear), dexamethasone (reference drug, 0.1 mg/ear), or vehicle was applied topically to the right ear 1 h before croton oil application.
3: Six hours after application of the inflammatory stimulus, the mice were euthanized, and a 6 mm diameter plug was removed from both the treated and untreated ears.
4: Edema was measured as the weight difference between the two plugs.
5: The data are expressed as the mean  SEM weight of the ears.
