0: To provide additional evidence supporting the potential anti-inflammatory effects produced by LEO, we also carried out a carrageenan or dextran-induced mice paw edema in mice ( n = 57 animals/group).
1: The negative control group received only subplantar injection of sterile saline.
2: The positive control group received subplantar injection of carrageenan or dextran (500  g/paw) and only treatment orally with LEO (50, 75, 100, and 250 mg/kg).
3: The paw volume was measured by digital plethysmometer (Ugo Basile, Italy) prior, 1, 2, and 4 hours after carrageenan injection, or 30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes after dextran injection.
4: Indomethacin (5 mg/kg, p.o.)
5: and celecoxib (10 mg/kg, p.o.)
6: were used as the reference drug in carrageenan-induced foot paw edema, and promethazine (10 mg/kg, p.o.)
7: was used as the reference drug in dextran-induced paw edema.
8: The paw edema, in  L, was calculated by the difference in the paw volume prior and after carrageenan or dextran injection.
9: After the last measurement, the animals were euthanized and the inflamed hind paws tissues were collected.
