0: The NO production was determined by measuring the nitrite level by Griess reaction.
1: Nitrite level was determined in ears and paws sections, obtained as above described.
2: The samples were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min at 4C.
3: The supernatant was separated (50  L) and incubated with equal volumes of Griess reagent mixtures (1% sulfanilamide in 5% phosphoric acid and 0,1%   N-1-naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride in water) at room temperature for 10 min.
4: The absorbance was measured in a microplate reader at 550 nm.
5: NO concentrations were calculated from a sodium nitrite standard curve.
6: Data were presented as the  M concentration of NO 2-.
