0: The plugs obtained from the right and left ears and paw sections were used to analyze myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity.
1: The ear and paws sections were placed in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) that contained 0.5% hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) in a Potter homogenizer.
2: The homogenate was shaken and centrifuged for 5 min.
3: A 10  L aliquot of the supernatant was added in triplicate to each well of microplate, in triplicate.
4: The supernatant solution was then mixed with 200  L of the buffer solution that contained  O-dianisidine dihydrochloride (16.7 mg, Sigma), double distilled water (90 mL), potassium phosphate buffer (10 mL), and 1% H 2O 2 (50  L).
5: The enzyme reaction was stopped by addition of sodium acetate.
6: MPO activity was determined by the absorbance measured at 460 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer (Spectra Max Plus).
