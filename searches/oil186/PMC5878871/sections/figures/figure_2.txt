0:  The animals were treated topically with LEO (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.5 mg/ear) or Dexa (0.1 mg/ear) 1 h before the croton oil-induced ear edema,  p< 0.05,  p< 0.001, and  p< 0.0001, compared with croton oil (a).
1: Myeloperoxidase enzyme activity,  p< 0.001,  p< 0.0001 compared with croton oil and # p< 0.0001 compared to vehicle (Vh) (b).
2: Nitric oxide levels,  p< 0.0001 compared with croton oil (c).
3: The ear edema, the activity of myeloperoxidase, and the nitric oxide concentration were determined 6 hours after application of croton oil.
