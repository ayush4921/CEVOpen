0: The positively charged anthocyanins were separated from the neutral polyphenolic compounds in the XAD-7 treated  Actinidia melanandra fruit (kiwifruit) extract using Dowex 50WX8 cation ion-exchange resin [ 81].
1: Feng and Zhao used semi-preparative chromatography to separate ()epigallocatechin-gallate [ 121, Fig.
2: 15)] and ()epicatechin-gallate ( 122) in tea crude extract with polysaccharide-based weakly acidic gel CM-Sephadex C-25 [ 82].
3: A new alkaloid, fumonisin B 6 ( 123), along with a known alkaloid, fumonisin B 2 ( 124), was isolated by IEC over Strata X-C mixed-mode RP-cation-exchange resin followed by reverse-phase chromatography from the fungus  Aspergillus niger NRRL 326 cultures extract [ 83].
