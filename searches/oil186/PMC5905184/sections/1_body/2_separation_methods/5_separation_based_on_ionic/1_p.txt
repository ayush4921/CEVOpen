0: Ion-exchange chromatography (IEC) separates molecules based on the differences in their net surface charge.
1: Some natural products, such as alkaloids and organic acids possessing a functional group capable of ionization, might be separated by IEC.
2: The charged molecules could be caught and released by ion-exchange resin by changing the ionic strength of the mobile phase (e.g., changing pH or salt concentration).
3: Cation ion-exchange resins were used for the separation of alkaloids, while the anion ion-exchange resins were used for the separation of natural organic acids and phenols.
