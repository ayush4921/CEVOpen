0: The structures of polyamides used in chromatography contain both acryl and amide groups.
1: Hydrophobic and/or hydrogen bond interaction will occur in polyamide column chromatography depending on the composition of the mobile phase.
2: When polar solvents such as aqueous solvents are used as the mobile phase, the polyamides act as the non-polar stationary phase and the chromatography behavior is similar to reversed-phase chromatography.
3: In the contrast, the polyamides act as the polar stationary phase and the chromatography behavior is similar to normal phase chromatography.
4: Polyamide column chromatography is a conventional tool for the separation of natural polyphenols including anthraquinones, phenolic acids and flavonoids, whose mechanisms are ascribed to hydrogen bond formation between polyamide absorbents, mobile phase and target compounds.
5: Gao et al.
6: studied the chromatography behavior of polyphenols including phenolic acids and flavonoids on polyamide column.
7: It was found that the polyamide functioned as a hydrogen bond acceptor, and the numbers of phenolic hydroxyls and their positions in the molecule affected the strength of adsorption [ 51].
8: In addition to polyphenols, the separation of other types of natural products by polyamide column chromatography were also reported.
9: The total saponins of Kuqingcha can be enriched by polyamide column chromatography, which significantly reduced the systolic pressure of SHR rat [ 52].
10: Using a mixture of dichloromethane and methanol in a gradient as the eluent, the seven major isoquinoline alkaloids in Coptidis Rhizoma including berberine ( 39), coptisine ( 40), palmatine ( 41), jatrorrhizine ( 42), columbamine ( 78), groenlandicine ( 79) (Fig.
11: 4), and magnoflorine ( 80, Fig.
12: 11) were separated in one-step polyamide column chromatography [ 53].
