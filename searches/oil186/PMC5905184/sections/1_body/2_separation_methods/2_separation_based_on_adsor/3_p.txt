0: Alumina (aluminum oxide) is a strong polar adsorbent used in the separation of natural products especially in the separation of alkaloids.
1: The strong positive field of Al 3+ and the basic sites in alumina affecting easily polarized compounds lead to the adsorption on alumina that is different from that on silica gel.
2: The application of alumina in the separation of natural products has decreased significantly in recent years because it can catalyze dehydration, decomposition or isomerization during separation.
3: Zhang and Su reported a chromatographic protocol using basic alumina to separate taxol ( 74, Fig.
4: 11) from the extract of  Taxus cuspidate callus cultures and found the recovery of taxol was more than 160%.
5: They found that the increase of taxol came from the isomerization of 7- epi-taxol ( 75) catalyzed by alumina.
6: It was also found that a small amount of taxol could be decomposed to baccatin III ( 76) and 10-deacetylbaccatin III ( 77) in the alumina column [ 49].
7: Further investigation into the separation of taxol on acidic, neutral and basic alumina indicated that the Lewis souci and the basic activity cores on the surface of alumina induced the isomerization of 7- epi-taxol to taxol [ 50].
