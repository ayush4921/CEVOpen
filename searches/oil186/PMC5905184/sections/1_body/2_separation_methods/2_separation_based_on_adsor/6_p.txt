0: Silver nitrate is another useful solid support in the separation of natural products.
1: Those natural products containing the  electrons reversibly interact with silver ions to form polar complexes.
2: The greater the number of double bonds or aromaticity of the natural product, the stronger the complexation forms.
3: Silver nitrate is typically impregnated on silica gel (SNIS) or alumina for separation.
4: Several research groups reported the separation of fatty acids on SNIS [ 59 61].
5: Wang et al.
6: reported the isolation of zingiberene from ginger oleoresin by SNIS column chromatography [ 62].
7: A pair of isomers, brasiliensic acid ( 83, Fig.
8: 11) and isobrasiliensic acid ( 84), were separated from  Calophyllum brasiliense by Lemos et al.
9: on an SNIS column [ 63,  69].
10: Some research groups also applied silver nitrate in the two-phase system in high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) to improve the separation.
11: Xanthochymol ( 85) and guttiferone E ( 86) are a pair of  bond benzophenone isomers from  Garcinia xanthochymus by AgNO 3-HSCCC.
12: The elution order of the  bond isomers in this AgNO 3-HSCCC separation is internal  bond (earlier) < terminal, which is identical to that observed from SNIS column chromatography [ 64].
