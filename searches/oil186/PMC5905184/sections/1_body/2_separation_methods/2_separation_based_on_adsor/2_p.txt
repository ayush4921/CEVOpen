0: Silica gel is the most widely used adsorbent in phytochemical investigation.
1: It was estimated that nearly 90% of phytochemical separation (preparative scale) was based on silica gel.
2: Silica gel is a polar absorbent with silanol groups.
3: Molecules are retained by the silica gel through hydrogen bonds and dipoledipole interactions.
4: Thus, polar natural products are retained longer in silica gel columns than nonpolar ones.
5: Sometimes, certain polar natural products might undergo irreversible chemisorption.
6: The deactivation of silica gel by adding water before use or using a water-containing mobile phase will weaken the adsorption.
7: Severe tailing may occur when separating alkaloids on silica gel, and the addition of a small amount of ammonia or organic amines such as triethylamine may reduce the tailing.
8: Twelve alkaloids belonging to the methyl chanofruticosinate group including six new alkaloids, prunifolines AF ( 68 73, Fig.
9: 11), were obtained from the leaf of  Kopsia arborea by initial silica gel column chromatography using gradient MeOHCHCl 3 as the mobile phase followed by centrifugal TLC using ammonia saturated Et 2Ohexane or EtOAc/hexane systems as the eluent [ 48].
