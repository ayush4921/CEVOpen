0: Membrane filtration has been a powerful tool for the concentration, clarification and removal of impurities in the lab, as well as in the food and pharmaceutical industries.
1: The contents of total phenols (338%), chlorogenic acid ( 66) (Fig.
2: 10) (483%), theobromine ( 112, Fig.
3: 13) (323%), caffeine ( 113) (251%), condensed tannins (278%) and saponins (211%) in the aqueous extract of  Ilex paraguariensis were significantly increased by nanofiltration [ 73,  80].
4: Coupling membrane filtration is applied when a single membrane filtration step is not satisfactory.
5: A sequence of microfiltration, ultrafiltration and nanofiltration was applied in the isolation of bioactive components from olive leaf extract.
6: Microfiltration followed by ultrafiltration removed the impurities larger than 5 kDa.
7: Nanofiltration recovered the antioxidative and antibacterial polyphenols and flavonoids, and the content of the major component, oleuropein ( 114), in the nanofiltration retentate was concentrated approximately ten times [ 74].
