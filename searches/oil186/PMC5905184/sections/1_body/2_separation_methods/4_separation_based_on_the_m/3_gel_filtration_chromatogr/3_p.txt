0: Sephadex LH20, a hydroxypropylated derivative of Sephadex G25, has both hydrophobic and hydrophilic natures.
1: An adsorption mechanism was also involved in separation using Sephadex LH-20.
2: Sephadex LH-20 can be used for the separation of a wide variety of natural products in either an aqueous or non-aqueous solvent system.
3: The feruloylated arabinoxylan oligosaccharides of perennial cereal grain intermediate wheat were well separated by Sephadex LH-20 using 100% water as the mobile phase [ 77].
4: Three new pyrimidine diterpenes, axistatins 13 ( 115 117, Fig.
5: 14) along with three known formamides ( 118 120) were isolated from the anti-cancer active CH 2Cl 2 fraction of  Agelas axifera over Sephadex LH-20 columns with a series of solvent systems [CH 3OH, CH 3OHCH 2Cl 2 (3:2), hexaneCH 3OH2-propanol (8:1:1), hexanetolueneCH 2Cl 2EtOH (17:1:1:1) and exaneEtOAcCH 3OH (4:5:1)], followed by purification using Prep-HPLC [ 78,  85,  87].
