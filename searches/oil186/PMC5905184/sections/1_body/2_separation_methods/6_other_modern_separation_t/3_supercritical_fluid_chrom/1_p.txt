0: SFC uses supercritical fluid as the mobile phase.
1: SFC integrates the advantages of both GC and liquid chromatography (LC) as the supercritical fluids possess properties of high dissolving capability, high diffusivity and low viscosity, which allows rapid and efficient separation.
2: Thus, SFC can use a longer column and smaller particles of the stationary phase than HPLC, which provides greater numbers of theoretical plates and better separation.
3: SFC can be used for the separation of non-volatile or thermally labile compounds to which GC is not applicable.
4: SFC systems are compatible with a wide range of different detectors including those used in LC and GC systems.
5: The polarity of the widely used mobile phase, S-CO 2, in SFC is close to the polarity of hexane, with the result that SFC was used for the separation of non-polar natural products such as fatty acids, terpenes and essential oils for many years.
6: Eluent modifiers such methanol and acetonitrile enhance the elution strength, which is increasing the interest in separating polar natural products by SFC [ 90 92].
