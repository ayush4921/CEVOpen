0: Two cyclopeptides, cyclolinopeptides C and E ( 150151, Fig.
1: 20), were obtained from flaxseed oil using a three zone SMBC with eight preparative HPLC normal phase spherical silica gel columns and using absolute ethanol as the desorbent [ 99].
2: Kang et al.
3: developed a tandem SMB process consisting of two four-zone SMB units in a series with the same adsorbent particle sizes in Ring I and Ring II to separate paclitaxel (taxol,  74) (Fig.
4: 11), 13-dehydroxybaccatin III ( 152), and 10-deacetylpaclitaxel ( 153).
5: Paclitaxel was recovered in the first SMB unit while 13-dehydroxybaccatin III and 10-deacetylpaclitaxel were separated in the second SMB unit [ 100].
6: Mun enhanced this SMB chromatography method by using different particle sizes adsorbent in Ring I and Ring II [ 101].
7: Supercritical fluids can also be used as the desorbent in SMB chromatography.
8: Liang et al.
9: successfully applied supercritical carbon dioxide with ethanol as the desorbent for a three-zone SMB to separate resveratrol ( 60) (Fig.
10: 9) and emodin ( 44) (Fig.
11: 4) from a crude extract of the TCM Polygoni Cuspidati Rhizoma et Radix [ 102].
