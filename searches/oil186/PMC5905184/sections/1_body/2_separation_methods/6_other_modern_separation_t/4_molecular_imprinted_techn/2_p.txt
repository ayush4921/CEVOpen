1: developed multi-template molecularly imprinted polymers using DL-tyrosine and phenylpyruvic acid as the template molecules to separate dencichine ( 143, Fig.
2: 19) from the water extract of  Panax notoginseng.
3: Both dencichine and the template molecule of DL-tyrosine ( 144) contain an amino (NH 2) group and a carboxylic acid (COOH) group, and the other template molecule, phenylpyruvic acid ( 145), has an -keto acid (COCOOH) group that can also be found in the structure of dencichine [ 96].

5: developed a preparative separation method to separate solanesol ( 146) from tobacco leaves by flash chromatography based on MIP.
6: The MIP was prepared with methyl methacrylate as the monomer, solanesol as the template molecule and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as the crosslinker by a suspension polymerization method.
7: A total of 370.8 mg of solanesol with 98.4% purity was separated from the extract of tobacco leaves with a yield of 2.5% of the dry weight of tobacco leaves [ 97].

9: used the thermo-responsive magnetic MIP to separate the three major curcuminoids, curcumin ( 147), demethoxycurcumin ( 148), and bisdemethoxycurcumin ( 149), from the TCM Curcumae Longae Rhizoma (the rhizome of  Curcuma longa).
10: The designed thermo-responsive magnetic MIP showed good imprinting factor for curcuminoids in a range between 2.4 and 3.1, thermo-responsiveness [lower critical solution temperature at 33.71 C] and rapid magnetic separation (5 s) [ 98].
