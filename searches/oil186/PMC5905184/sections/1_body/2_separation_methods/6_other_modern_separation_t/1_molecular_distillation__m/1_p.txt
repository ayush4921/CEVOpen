0: Molecular distillation separates the molecular by distillation under vacuum at a temperature far below its boiling point.
1: It is a suitable distillation method for separating thermosensitive and high-molecular-weight compounds.
2: Borgarello et al.
3: obtained a thymol ( 125, Fig.
4: 16) enrichment fraction from oregano essential oil by molecular distillation modeled by artificial neural networks.
5: The obtained fraction had antioxidant properties and could stabilize the sunflower oil [ 84].
6: Three kinds of phthalates were effectively removed from sweet orange oil by molecular distillation under the optimal conditions (evaporation temperature of 50 C, evaporator pressure of 5 kPa and a feed flow rate of 0.75 ml/min) [ 85].
