0: Five volatile compounds, namely, curzerene ( 98) (6.6 mg),  -elemene ( 100, Fig.
1: 12) (5.1 mg), curzerenone ( 126) (41.6 mg), curcumenol ( 127) (46.2 mg), and curcumenone ( 128) (21.2 mg) (Fig.
2: 17), were separated from the methanol extract of Curcuma Rhizome by Prep-GC over a stainless steel column packed with 10% OV-101 (3 m  6 mm, i.d.)
3: after 83 single injections (20 l) [ 87].
4: Prep-GC was also applied for the separation of natural isomers.
5: A total of 178 mg of  cis-asarone ( 129) and 82 mg of  trans-asarone ( 130) were obtained from the essential oil of  Acorus tatarinowii after 90 single injections (5 l) on the same column as above [ 88].
6: Prep-GC has become an important separation method for natural volatile compounds; however, a heavier sample load and the large-diameter preparative column employed decreased the efficiency [ 89].
7: Meanwhile, the disadvantages of Prep-GC, including the lack of commercial Prep-GC equipment, consumption of a large volume of carrier gas, the decomposition of thermolabile compounds under high operation temperature, the difficulties of fraction collection, and low production, still restrict the usage of Prep-GC.
