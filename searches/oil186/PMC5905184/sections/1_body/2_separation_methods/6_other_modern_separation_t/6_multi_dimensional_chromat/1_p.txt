0: The components in the extract subjected to separation were complex, and generally, no pure compound will be separated in one column chromatography.
1: Multi-dimensional separation based on the solid phase extraction and coupling of multiple columns with different stationary phases greatly improves the separation efficiency.
2: With more commercial multiple dimensional separation equipment entering the market, the separation of natural products is becoming more rapid, efficient and automated.
