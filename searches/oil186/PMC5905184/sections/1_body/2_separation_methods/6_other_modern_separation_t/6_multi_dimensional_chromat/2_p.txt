0: Usually, the target compound was enriched by first dimensional separation and purified by last dimensional separation.
1: Multi-dimensional separation can be achieved using the same type separation equipment (LC or GC) or different types of equipment (GC and LC).
2: A novel volatile compound, (2 E,6 E)-2-methyl-6-(4-methylcyclohex-3-enylidene)hept-2-enal ( 154), was purified by a three-dimensional prep-GC from wampee essential oil [ 103].
3: Five antioxidant compounds, including two alkaloids [glusodichotomine AK ( 155) and glusodichotomine B ( 156)] and three flavonoids [tricin ( 157), homoeriodictyol ( 158) (Fig.
4: 21), and luteolin ( 3) (Fig.
5: 1)], were separated using a two-dimensional HPLC (RP/HILIC) method from  Arenaria kansuensis on a RP-C18HCE and a NP-XAmide preparative columns [ 104].
6: Sciarrone et al.
7: exploited the separation of sesquiterpenes in patchouli essential oil by three dimensional Prep-GC.
8: Patchouli alcohol ( 111, Fig.
9: 12) (496 g) was separated in the first dimension on a poly(5% diphenyl/95% dimethylsiloxane) column, and 295 g of  -bulnesene ( 159) was from a second column coated with high molecular weight polyethylene glycol as well as 160 g  -guaiene ( 160) from the third dimension on an ionic-liquid based column (SLB-IL60) [ 105].
10: Panto et al.
11: applied two three-dimensional approaches (GCGCGC and LCGCGC) to separate the sesquiterpene alcohols [( Z)- -santalol ( 161), ( Z)- - trans bergamotol ( 162), ( Z)- -santalol ( 163),  epi-( Z)- -santalol ( 164),  -bisabolol ( 165), ( Z)-lanceol ( 166), and ( Z)-nuciferol ( 167)] from the sandalwood essential oil.
12: They found that the first dimensional separation using LC reduced the sample complexity and increased the productivity of low-concentration components [ 106].
