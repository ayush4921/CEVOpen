0: Partition chromatography (PC) follows the liquidliquid extraction principle based on the relative solubility in two different immiscible liquids.
1: In the early stage, one liquid phase was coated to a solid matrix (silica gel, carbon, cellulose, etc.)
2: as the stationary phase and another liquid phase was employed as the mobile phase.
3: The disadvantage of an easily removed stationary phase and unrepeatable results has led to this kind of PC being rarely used today.
4: The bonded-phase, in which the liquid stationary phase is chemically bound to the inert support, which is used as the stationary phase overcomes those drawbacks.
5: Commercially available alkyl such as C8 and C18, aryl, cyano and amino substituted silanes are often used as bonded phases, which are widely used to separate a variety of natural products, especially in the final purification step.
