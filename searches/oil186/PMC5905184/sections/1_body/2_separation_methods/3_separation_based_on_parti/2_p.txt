0: Three PTS (notoginsenoside R1 ( 87) (Fig.
1: 11), ginsenosides Rg1 ( 55) (Fig.
2: 8) and Re ( 88) (Fig.
3: 11)) and two PDS [ginsenosides Rb1 ( 7) and Rd ( 9)] (Fig.
4: 3) were well separated in a C18 column using the EtOHH 2O system as the mobile phase [ 65].
5: A novel polyacrylamide-based silica stationary phase was synthesized by Cai et al.
6: and was successfully applied in the separation of galactooligosaccharides and saponins of  Paris polyphylla with EtOHH 2O as the mobile phase [ 66].
