0: Regional variability of the chemical composition of  T. vulgare essential oils is well-known and many essential oil chemotypes have been reported in the literature [ 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21].
1: For example,  T. vulgare essential oil chemotypes from Hungary and Argentina are mainly composed of -thujone (72.4% and 91.65%, respectively) [ 15, 20].
2: However,  T. vulgare essential oil chemotypes from Finland and Lithuania [ 10, 12] had, respectively, artemisia ketone (55.08% to 81.36%) and 1,8-cineole (3.6% to 39.7%) as the main constituents.
3: Kumar et al.
4: [ 22] have thoroughly reviewed this chemotype variability of  Tanacetum.
5: Despite the many regional chemotypes, many studies of the biological effects of  T. vulgare essential oils did not analyze the complete chemical composition of the oils nor its constituents in relation to their biological properties.
