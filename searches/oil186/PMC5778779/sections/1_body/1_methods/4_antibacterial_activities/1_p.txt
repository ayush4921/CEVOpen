0: Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were used for analyses.
1: The Gram-positive bacteria included  Bacillus cereus (clinical isolate),  Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC 19113),  Micrococcus flavus (ATCC 10240) and  Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538).
2: The Gram-negative bacteria included  Dickeya solani (D s04321),  Escherichia coli (ATCC 35210),  Pectobacterium atrosepticum (ATCC 33260),  Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp.
3: carotovorum (ATCC 15713), and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa (D s04321).
4: The micro-dilution method [ 44] was used to determine the MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC).
5: The concentration of the bacteria was adjusted to 1.0  10 5 CFU/mL by using sterile saline, and then stored at 4 C. The essential oils were added to 100 L Triptic Soy broth (TSB) containing a bacteria inoculum (1.0  10 5 CFU/well) in a microtiter plate, then the MICs and MBCs were determined.
6: The microplates were incubated at 37 C for 24 h in a rotary shaker.
