0: The activities of EOs against several fungi, including  Aspergillus flavus (ATCC 9643),  A. ochraceus (ATCC 12066),  A. niger (ATCC 6275),  Candida albicans (ATCC 12066),  Penicillium funiculosum (ATCC 56755) and  P. ochrochloron (ATCC 48663) were examined.
1: The cultures were renewed monthly and stored at 4 C. The microdilution method [ 44], was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) using a spore suspension concentration of (1.0  10 5 CFU/mL) dilutions in 96-well microtiter plates.
2: EOs were diluted to the desired concentrations in microplates containing Malt medium broth mixed with inoculum.
3: The microplates were incubated at 28 C for 72 h on a rotary shaker.
