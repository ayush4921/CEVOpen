0: The lowest concentration that inhibits fungi growth at the binocular microscope level was defined as the MIC.
1: The MFC was defined as the minimum concentration showing no visible growth, which is consistent with a 99.5% killing of the original inoculum.
2: Serial sub-cultivations (2 L) of essential oils were incubated at 28 C for 72 h in microtiter plates containing 100 L of broth and inoculum were used to calculate the MIC.
3: Ketoconazole (KTZ) (13500 g/mL) was used as a positive control.
4: The experiments were performed in triplicate.
