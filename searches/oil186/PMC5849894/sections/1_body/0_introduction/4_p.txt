0: Tetracarpidium conophorum is cultivated in littoral and western Cameroon, where it is, respectively, known as  kaso or  ngak.
1: The seeds are boiled and roasted for commercialization, consumption, and biscuitlike snack food production (Babalola,  2011).
2: Many studies have reported the effect of processing temperature on the nutritional, antinutritional values, and antioxidant properties, and African walnut seeds in some countries.
3: These include: effect of boiling and traditional roasting on the nutritional, antinutritional, and antioxidant properties of African walnuts seeds (Arinola & Adesina,  2014); impact of processing on the nutrient content, vitamin, and mineral composition of African walnuts (Okonkwo & Ozoude,  2014); effect of cooking on phenolic content and antioxidant properties of African walnuts seeds Ademiluyi, Oboh, Aragbaiye, Oyeleye, and Ogunsuyi ( 2015).
4: Though considerable attention had been given to the study of African walnut seeds, there is, however, very limited reports on the effects of processing on the walnut seeds grown in Cameroon, and especially on the quality of their lipids.
5: Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of boiling and different roasting methods on lipid quality and proximate composition of walnut seeds.
