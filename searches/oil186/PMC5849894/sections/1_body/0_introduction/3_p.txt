0: Thermal or heat processing is one of the most important methods developed by humans.
1: During thermal processing, eventhough antinutritional components are reduced or eliminated; heat has a detrimental effect on the nutritional and functional properties of foods (Kanu et al.,  2015).
2: Then, the thermal treatment of walnuts can lead to chemical changes that can affect its nutritional value and the quality of its lipids.
3: During boiling and roasting of the seeds, high temperatures can facilitate lipid oxidation and nonenzymatic browning reactions, which can reduce the nutritional value of foods, causing the loss of essential fatty acids, essential aminoacids and carbohydrates.
4: The amount of vitamins can also be reduced as well as the proteins digestibility (Cuvelier & Maillard,  2012).
5: Additionally, these chemical alteration reactions may generate toxic compounds in edible seeds and the derived products, which can be harmful for the consumers (Djikeng et al.,  2017).
