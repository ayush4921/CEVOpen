0: African walnut ( Tetracarpidium conophorum) is a popular Central and Western Africa plant where it is planted mainly for its nuts, which are usually eaten as snacks when the unshelled nuts are boiled and cracked (Babalola,  2011).
1: The proximate composition of  T. conophorum revealed that it is rich in protein (29.14%), fat (54.14%), carbohydrate (4.17%), ash (3.32%), and several vitamins (Arinola & Adesina,  2014).
2: A bitter taste is usually observed upon drinking water immediately after eating the nuts, due to the presence of antinutrients.
3: The leaves, barks, and nuts of  T. conophorum have also been demonstrated as good sources of phenolic antioxidants with various biological properties.
4: Food materials are usually processed in order to improve palatability and reduce toxicity, and as a means of preservation (Kanu, Kalu, & Okorie,  2015).
5: Walnuts seeds are generally consumed after several processing techniques.
6: General method of processing of walnut prior to consumption involves prolonged cooking of the seeds by boiling and roasting with or without the shell.
7: These processing methods usually improve the organoleptic properties of the nuts, reduce their antinutrients content, and prolong their shelf life (Ayankunbi, Keshinro, & Egele,  1991).
