0: Moisture, fat, ash, and protein content of all the samples were determined using standard analytical methods described by AOAC procedures (AOAC,  1990).
1: Moisture content was determined by drying walnut seeds in oven at 103C until a constant weight was achieved according to the AOAC procedures 925.40 (AOAC,  1990).
2: Ash content was determined by incineration of walnut seeds at 550C according to the AOAC procedures 942.05 (AOAC,  1990).
3: Nitrogen (N) content was determined using microKjeldahl method, according to AOAC procedures 984.13 (AOAC,  1990), the protein content was calculated as N  6.25.
4: Lipid content was determined using Soxhlet apparatus with hexane, following AOAC 963.15 methodology (AOAC,  1990).
5: The total percentage carbohydrate content was determined by the difference method as reported by Onyeike et al.
6: ( 2015).
7: This method involved adding the total values of crude protein, crude fat, moisture and ash constituents of the sample and subtracting it from 100.
8: All samples were analyzed in triplicate.
