0: Oils were extracted from samples containing water ( FBWN 60 min , TRFWN 30 min, FWN,  and DBWN 60 min) using the method described by Bligh and Dyer ( 1959).
1: About 80 g of nuts were introduced in a grinding machine (Moulinex) to which 100 ml of chloroform and 200 ml of methanol were subsequently added.
2: The mixture was grinded for 3 min; follow by the addition of 100 ml of chloroform and 100 ml of water.
3: The mixture was again grinded for 1 min, and filtered.
4: The final extraction was ensured by the addition of chloroform, this in order to respect the following proportion: 2:2:1.8 for chloroform, methanol, and water, respectively.
5: After separating the different phases in a funnel, the organic phase was collected and dried using sodium anhydrous.
6: The organic solvent was then eliminated by evaporation on a rotatory evaporator at 45C under reduced pressure.
7: The extracted oils were stored in the refrigerator at 4C for further analysis.
