0: For the determination of minerals, walnut seeds were ashed at 550C and the ash boiled with 10 ml of 20% HCl in a beaker and then filtered into a 100 ml standard flask to determine the mineral content.
1: Calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), potassium (K), and iron (Fe) were determined by atomic absorption spectrometer (Varian 220FS Spectra AA, Les Ulis, France).
2: Phosphorus (P) was determined colorimetrically using the vanado molybdate, according to AOAC procedure 965.17 (AOAC,  1999).
3: Mineral contents of the samples were determined from calibration curves of standards minerals.
4: All samples were analyzed in triplicate.
