0: For the EHT, 24-well plates (TPP ref.
1: no.
2: 92024) containing aqueous solutions of approximately 100 eggs/well were used as proposed by Katiki et al.
3: [ 19].
4: The treatments consisted of different concentrations of each essential oil (50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, 1.562, 0.781, 0.390, 0.195 and 0.097 mg/ml) in a final volume of 0.5 ml/well completed with distilled water.
5: The oils were solubilized in distilled water and Tween 80 (3%, v/v).
6: After incubation for 24 h (27 C), the number of eggs and first-stage (L1) larvae were counted under an inverted microscope and compared to the positive (thiabendazole, 0.025 mg/ml) and negative controls (3% Tween 80, v/v).
7: The results were expressed as the mean percentage of inhibition of egg hatching in three independent experiments performed in triplicate.
