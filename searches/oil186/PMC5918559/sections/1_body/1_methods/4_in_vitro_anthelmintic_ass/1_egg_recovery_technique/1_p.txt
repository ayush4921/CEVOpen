0: The egg hatch test (EHT) and larval development test (LDT) described below were carried out after the recovery of  H. contortus eggs according to the method described previously [ 18].
1: Approximately 20 g of feces were collected from the rectal ampulla of monospecifically infected animals and immediately filtered under running water (37 C) through sieves with a mesh size of 500, 150, 90 and 20 m, respectively.
2: The eggs retained on the last sieve were washed, centrifuged for 5 min at 1811  g with distilled water, and recovered in super-saturated saline by simple flotation.
3: After recovery, the eggs were stored on the 20 m sieve for abundant washing with distilled water to produce a final and quantified aqueous solution of eggs.
