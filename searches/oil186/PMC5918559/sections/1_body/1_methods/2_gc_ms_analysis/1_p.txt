0: Samples of each essential oil were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (Varian, model Saturn 2100T) using the following technical conditions: DB-5 capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm  0.25 m); gun: 240 C; detector: 230 C; electron impact: 70 eV; carrier gas: He; flow rate: 1.0 ml/min; split: 1/20; temperature program: 60240 C, 3 C/min; injection volume: 1 l. The chemical compounds were identified by comparison of their mass spectra with the GC-MS database (Nist 62 library) and Kovats retention index [ 16].
