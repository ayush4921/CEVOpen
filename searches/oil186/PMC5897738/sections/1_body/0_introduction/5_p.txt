0: Although the use of RC extract for gastrointestinal problems seems to be related to its presumptive smooth muscle-relaxant effect, interestingly no  in vitro or  in vivo studies have been carried out so far to assess this bioactivity.
1: However, in an  in vitro study an aqueous extract of  C. nobile was demonstrated to induce a vasorelaxant effect through the NO-cGMP pathway or possibly through a combination of Ca 2+ channel inhibition plus NO-modulating and phosphodiesterase inhibitory mechanisms.
2: After the oral administration of RC aqueous extract, significant hypotensive effect was observed in an animal study on spontaneously hypertensive rats ( Zeggwagh et al., 2009), which may be related to the flavonoid content of the plant ( Jouad et al., 2001).
3: The clinical efficacy of orally applied preparations has not been studied yet, only the effects of external application ( Schrader et al., 1997) and aromatherapeutic use ( Wilkinson et al., 1999) have been reported.
