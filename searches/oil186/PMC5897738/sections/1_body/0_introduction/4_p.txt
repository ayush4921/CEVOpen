0: Although several studies on the bioactivities of RC are available, the majority of these studies were carried out using the essential oil, which is not used medicinally, or the observed activities are not related to the traditional use of the plant.
1: Several studies demonstrate the antimicrobial effects of RC essential oil against different bacterial and fungal strains ( Hansel et al., 1993;  Piccaglia et al., 1993;  Chao et al., 2000;  Bail et al., 2009), and antifungal activity was demonstrated also for the aqueous extracts of RC ( Magro et al., 2006).
2: The anti-inflammatory capacity and heat shock protein modulating effects of the flavonoids apigenin and quercetin, as well as the anti-inflammatory activities of -bisabolol, guajazulene, and chamazulene have been reported in preclinical studies ( Viola et al., 1995;  Baghalian et al., 2008,  2011;  Hernandez-Ceruelos et al., 2010).
3: The polysaccharides of RC exerted antiphlogistic effect  in vivo ( Lukacs, 1990).
