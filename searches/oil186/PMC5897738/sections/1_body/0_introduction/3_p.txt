0: The majority of the secondary metabolites described from the plant belong to the aliphatic esters (essential oil) ( Fauconnier et al., 1996), sesquiterpene lactones ( Bisset, 1994) and flavonoids ( Herisset et al., 1971,  1973;  Abou-Zied and Rizk, 1973;  Pietta et al., 1991).
1: The polysaccharide content of the dried flower is noteworthy, 3.9% ( Lukacs, 1990).
2: The supposed smooth muscle-relaxant activity of the plant might be attributed to its flavonoid content.
3: Apigenin and luteolin possess remarkable smooth muscle relaxant effects on guinea pig ileum ( Lemmens-Gruber et al., 2006).
