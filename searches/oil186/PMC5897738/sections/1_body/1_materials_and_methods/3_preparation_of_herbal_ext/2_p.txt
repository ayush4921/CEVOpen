0: From the methanolic extract of 200 g RC flowers, four marker compounds (used as reference standards in further experiments) were isolated using medium pressure liquid chromatography (SiO 2 as stationary phase), gel chromatography (Sephadex LH-20), preparative HPLC (RP), and preparative TLC (SiO 2).
1: The purity and identity of these compounds were analyzed by NMR.
2: NMR spectra were recorded in MeOD on a Bruker Avance DRX 500 spectrometer (Bruker, Fallanden, Switzerland) at 500 MHz ( 1H) or 125 MHz ( 13C).
