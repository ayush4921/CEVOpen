0: For the pharmacological experiments, RC crude extract was prepared according to the description of the European Medicines Agency monograph ( EMA-HMPC, 2012).
1: Ten grams of plant material was extracted with 70% EtOH (3  100 ml) via ultrasonic bath, evaporated in vacuum and lyophilized (yield, 3.169%).
2: Part of the RC crude extract was fractionated to gain RC extract fractions with different compositions for further experiments.
3: Vacuum liquid chromatography on polyamide with elution by MeOH-H 2O (20:80, 40:60, 60:40, 80:20, 100:0) was used to gain fractions from the crude extract as follows: F20, F40, F60, F80, and F100.
