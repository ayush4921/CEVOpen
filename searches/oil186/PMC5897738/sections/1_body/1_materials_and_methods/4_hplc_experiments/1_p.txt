0: HPLC experiments were carried out on a Shimadzu LC-20AD Liquid Chromatograph (SPD-M20A diode array detector, CBM-20A controller, SIL-20AC HT autosampler, DGU-20A 5R degasser unit, CTO-20AC column oven) using a Kinetex 5 m C-18 100A (150 mm  4.6 mm) with a gradient of 0,01% trifluoroacetic acid in H 2O (A) and acetonitrile (B) as follows: 05 min 25% B, 14 min 28% B, 15 min 70% B, 16 min 70% B, 16.5 min 25% B, and 20 min 25% B.
1: The flow was 1.2 ml/min, column oven temperature was 55C.
2: Detection was carried out within the range of 190800 nm.
3: For quantification, chromatograms were integrated at 344 nm.
4: The reference standards and the evaporated extracts were dissolved in MeOH, filtered through a PTFE syringe filter and injected in volumes of 5 or 10 l. Calibration curves were established for all the four reference standards.
