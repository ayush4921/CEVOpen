0: Smooth muscle preparations were used in a traditional organ bath arrangement.
1: The preparations were suspended in KrebsHenseleit solution of 5 or 7 ml, kept at 37C, and aerated with a mixture of 95% O 2 and 5% CO 2.
2: The solution contained 119 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO 3, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgSO 4, 2.5 mM CaCl 2, 1.2 mM KH 2PO 4, and 11 mM glucose (pH = 7.4).
3: Movements of the preparations were recorded with isotonic transducers (Hugo Sachs Elektronik-Harvard Apparatus, March, Germany) on ink writers or stored online on a personal computer.
