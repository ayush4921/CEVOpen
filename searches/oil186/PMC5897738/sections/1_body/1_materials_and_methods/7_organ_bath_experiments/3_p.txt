0: In another set of experiments the possible relaxant effect of the materials was tested.
1: For this reason, a tonic, approximately half-maximal contraction of the ileum was provoked by a moderate concentration of histamine (0.5 M, added for 15 min).
2: In preliminary experiments, no pretreatment was used.
3: In the bulk of the experiments, however, the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine, as well as tetrodotoxin, an inhibitor of nerve axonal conduction (blocker of voltage-sensitive Na + channels) was added prior to the histamine administration.
4: This was done to avoid the interference with a possible contractile effect of the material to be examined, i.e., to create a methodologically clear situation.
