0: The GC analysis was carried out with an HP 5890 Series II gas chromatograph (FID), using a 30 m  0.35 mm  0.25 m HP-5 fused silica capillary column.
1: The temperature program ranged from 60C to 210C at 3C min -1, and from 210C to 250C (2 min hold) at 5C min -1.
2: The detector and injector temperature was set to 250C and the carrier gas was N 2, with split sample introduction.
3: Quantities of the individual components of the essential oil were expressed as the percent of the peak area relative to the total peak area from the GC/FID analysis.
