0: Identification of the compounds was based on comparisons with published MS data ( Adams, 2007) and with a computer library search (the database was delivered together with the instrument) and also by comparing their retention indices with literature values ( Adams, 2007).
1: Retention indices were calculated against C8C32  n-alkanes on a CB-5 MS column ( Kovats, 1965).
2: A mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons was injected in hexane (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) by using the same temperature program that was used for analyzing the essential oil.
