0: The GC-MS analysis was performed with a Finninan GCQ ion trap bench-top mass spectrometer.
1: All conditions were as above except that the carrier gas was He at a linear velocity of 31.9 cm s -1 and the capillary column was DB-5MS (30 m  0.25 mm  0.25 m).
2: The positive ion electron ionization mode was used, with ionization energy of 70 eV, and the mass range of 40400 amu.
