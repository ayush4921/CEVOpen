0: Antibiofilm activity was determined by microtiter-plate technique [ 21] with crystal violet (CV) assay, counting viable cells in Colony Forming Units (CFU) [ 22].
1: In order to determine the PAEO and carvacrol action in the biofilm, plates were subjected to optical density microplate reading (Molecular Devices -SpectraMaxParadigmMulti-Mode) at a wavelength of 570 nm.
2: Activity was found in concentrations that failed to display the adhesion of crystal violet in any of the wells.
