0: For CIM, CBM and antibiofilm activity, TSB containing the test substance (PAEO or carvacrol) in concentrations of 4 mg mL 1, 2 mg mL 1, 1 mg mL  1, 0.5 mg mL  -1, 0.25 mg mL  -1, 0.125 mg mL 1 and 0.0625 mg mL 1 was used as turbidity control.
1: For contamination control, only the culture medium (TSB) in three wells on the plates we used.
2: Negative control was done by inoculating 100 L of strain (1.25  10 7 CFU mL 1) in wells containing culture medium (TSB).
3: As positive control, tetracycline in the same concentration of test substances was used: 4 mg mL 1, 2 mg mL 1, 1 mg mL  1, 0.5 mg mL  -1, 0.25 mg mL  -1, 0.125 mg mL 1 and 0.0625 mg mL 1.
