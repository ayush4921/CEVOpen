0: The essential oil chemical analysis was performed by gas chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer (GC-MS) using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu QP2010 Plus), and helium (He) as carrier gas.
1: A capillary column Factor Four/ VF-5 ms, 30 m length, 0.25 mm internal diameter, 0.25 mm film thickness was used.
2: The carrier gas flow rate was 1 mL min 1.
3: The initial oven temperature was 60 C. After heating for 2 min, it increased at a constant rate of 2 C per minute up to 110 C; then 3 C per minute to 150 C; and 15 C per minute to 290 C to a final, isotherm 290 C for 17 min.
4: The injector and detector temperatures were respectively 250 C and 310 C. The mode of injection was split and the injection volume was 1 mL.
5: Mass spectra were produced by electron impact (70 eV).
6: Quantitative analysis of the essential oil composition was made on a gas chromatograph, coupled with HP5890 Series II ionization detector, using the same operating conditions and the same type of column as the CG/EM analysis (except for the injector and detector temperatures, which were of 220 C and 250 C, respectively).
7: The percentage of each constituent is calculated by the integral of the area under the respective peaks to the total area of all the constituents of the sample.
8: The various constituents of the essential oil were identified by visual comparison of their mass spectra with those in the literature [ 20] and with actual standards in Nist08 library computer system, as well as by comparing retention rates with those in the literature [ 20].
9: A standard solution of n-alkanes (C8-C20) was injected under the same chromatographic conditions used to provide samples and to get retention rates.
