0: Determination of MIC and MBC was performed by microdilution technique in Tryptone Soy Broth (TSB) [ 19], using polystyrene plates of 96 wells and two strains:  S. aureus ATCC 6538, and oxacillin- and vancomycin-resistant  S. aureus (OVRSA).Concentration of both strains was adjusted in TSB to 1.25  10 7 Colony Forming Units (CFU mL 1).20 replicates of each strain were tested with PAEO and carvacrol in concentrations of 4 mg mL 1, 2 mg mL 1, 1 mg mL 1, 0.5 mg mL 1, 0.25 mg mL 1, 0.125 mg mL 1 and 0.0625 mg mL 1.
1: MIC was determined from visual reading and was considered the concentration able to inhibit microbial growth.
2: In order to determine the MBC, a pool was made of 10 wells for each concentration, and then plating was performed in 10 L in triplicate Tryptone Soy Agar.
3: The concentration which was not verified microbial growth was considered CBM.
