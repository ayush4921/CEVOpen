0: Thirty five  Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from pasteurized milk ( n = 12) and shrimp ( n = 23) were used.
1: All strains are part of the bacterial catalogue available at Center for Applied Molecular Bioprospecting and Experimentation (NUBEM - INTA College) and had the following biochemical characteristics: Gram-positive cocci, catalase-positive, manitol-positive and coagulase-positive.
2: The strains, maintained in Tryptone Soy Broth with 20% glycerol, were plated onto Mannitol Salt Agar (35 C for 48 h) and isolated Tryptone Soy Agar for performing microbiological analyzes.
