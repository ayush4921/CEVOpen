0: S. aureus resistant strains were inoculated in Brain Heart Infusion broth and cultured for 24 h at 35 C. Then, 2.0 mL of each culture was retrieved for plasmid DNA extraction with a commercially available extraction kit (GeneJET Plasmid Miniprep Kit).
1: A 3.0 L aliquot of each sample of extracted DNA was submitted to 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis in TBE buffer for 60 min at 120 V, 200 mA and 100 w. The plasmid DNA was viewed under UV light with a Spectrolinetransilluminator and photographed with a Kodak EDAS 290.
