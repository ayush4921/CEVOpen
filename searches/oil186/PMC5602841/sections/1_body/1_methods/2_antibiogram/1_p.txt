0: As screening for the selection of drug-resistant strain for Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and antibiofilm activity, all strains ( n = 35) were submitted to antimicrobial susceptibility profile by disk diffusion method using Mueller Hinton Agar [ 16].
1: The following antibiotics discs were used: oxacillin (1 g), penicillin G (10 U), ampicillin (10 g), cefotaxime (30 g), ceftriaxone (30 g), cefepime (30 g), imipenem (10 g), vancomycin (30 g), gentamicin (10 g), and chloramphenicol (30 g).
2: Antimicrobial susceptibility was detected by analyzing the inhibition zones, measured and compared according the standards set by the CLSI (2012) [ 19] which classify the strains as sensitive, intermediate or resistant.
