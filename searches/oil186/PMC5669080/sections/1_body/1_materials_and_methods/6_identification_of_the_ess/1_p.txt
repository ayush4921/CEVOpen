0: This was achieved by library search on a Wiley 275 L GC/MS database, observed Kovats index and by comparing the retention indices and mass fragmentation patterns to those of the available references as well as of published data.
1: [ 28] The quantitative estimation was carried out by peak area measurement.
2: A series of authentic  n-alkanes was subjected to GC under the same experimental conditions, and the retention indices of the oil constituents were calculated.
3: The individual components were determined by computerized peak area measurement.
4: Compounds of the essential oil, their retention indices, and relative percentage composition are compiled [Tables  1 and  2].
