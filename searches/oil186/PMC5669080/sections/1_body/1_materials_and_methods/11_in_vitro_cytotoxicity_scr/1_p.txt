0: Samples of flower-, leaves-derived oil at different concentrations (0.050.0 g/ml) in DMSO were tested for cytotoxicity, against the aforementioned human tumor cell lines adopting SRB stain assay.
1: The relation between surviving fractions and oil concentration was plotted to get the survival curve of each tumor cell line after the application of the specific concentration.
2: The results were compared to those of the standard cytotoxic drug, doxorubicin (10 mg Adriamycin hydrochloride, in 5 ml intravenous injection, Pharmacia, Italy) at the same concentrations.
3: The dose of the test solutions which reduces survival to 50% (IC 50) was calculated [ Table 4].
