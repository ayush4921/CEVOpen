0: The antimicrobial activity was performed against a set of 8 representative Gram-positive and negative bacterial and two fungal strains of standard properties [ Table 3].
1: These were maintained in the Micro Analytical Center, Faculty of Science, Cairo University.
2: The tested Gram-positive bacteria were ( Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6051,  Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600 and  Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 19433).
3: The Gram-negative bacteria included ( Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145,  Escherichia coli ATCC 11775, and  Neisseria gonorrhea ATCC 19424), and fungi ( Aspergillus flavus and  Candida albicans ATCC 26555).
4: The tested bacteria were grown on nutrient agar (Oxoid, England) and fungi on Sabouraud's glucose agar (Oxoid, England).
5: Tetracycline (Oxoid, UK) and Amphotericin B (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) were used as standard antibacterial and antifungal agents.
