0: The water and oil holding capacity was determined using adapted methods outlined by Tirgar et al.
1: [ 28].
2: Deionised water (5 mL) or cold pressed rape seed oil (5 mL; Zeaola TM, New Zealand Vegetable Oil Ltd., Christchurch, New Zealand) was added to 0.25 g of LM, DLM, SLF, ILF or SF in 15 mL centrifuge tubes.
3: The mixture was agitated at 300 rpm for 30 min in an orbital mixer incubator (Ratek, VIC, Australia), then centrifuged at 1610 g for 10 min at 4 C (Beckman, Coulter Ltd., Pao Alto, CA USA).
4: The supernatant volume was decanted and measured using a measuring cylinder.
5: The water (WHC) and oil holding capacity (OHC) is expressed as the amount of water or oil (mL) that can be held per gram of sample (g) and was calculated using the following equation:  (2)WHC/OHC (mL/g)=(volume of water added(mL)volume of water in the supernatant (mL))weight of sample (g)
