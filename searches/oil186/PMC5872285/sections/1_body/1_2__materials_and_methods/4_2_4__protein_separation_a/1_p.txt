0: Protein fractions were extracted from defatted locust meal (DLM) using an adapted alkali isoelectric precipitation method outlined by Amza [ 27] and Tirgar et al.
1: [ 28].
2: Figure 1 below shows a basic schematic diagram of the various fractions extracted.
3: DLM (11 g) was mixed with deionized water (EMD Millipore Corporation, Milli-Q Advantage A10 Water System, Merck, Billerica, MA, USA) at 5% ( w/ v) and stirred using an overhead stirrer (IKA, RW20, Total Lab Systems, Auckland, New Zealand).
4: The pH was adjusted to 10.0 [ 15] using 1 M NaOH (VWR International, LLC, Global Science Ltd.,Auckland, New Zealand) and stirred at 900 rpm for 1.5 h. The solution was centrifuged at 15,300 g for 30 min at 4 C (Beckman JA-14 M/E, Beckman Coulter Ltd., Palo Alto, CA, USA).
5: This was repeated once more, ultimately forming two fractions ( Figure 1); solid residue referred to as the insoluble locust fraction (ILF), and the upper liquid layer (pooled supernatant).
6: The supernatants pH was adjusted to 4.0 using 1 M HCl and stirred at 900 rpm for 1 h. pH 4 and 10 were chosen following similar methods conducted by Buler et al.
7: [ 15].
8: After centrifugation at the same conditions as above, the residual precipitated protein was re-suspended twice in acidified water (pH 4) and centrifuged at similar conditions for 30 min.
9: This formed two fractions; precipitated locust protein referred to as soluble locust fraction (SLF) and the supernatant fraction (SF).
10: SLF was adjusted to pH 7 using 1 M NaOH.
11: The resulting three fractions; ILF, SLF and SF, were freeze dried and stored in a desiccator at room temperature for further analysis.
12: Protein and fat contents were identified using the same methods as proximate analysis.
13: Yield of each fraction is based on dry weight basis compared to total initial weight.
14: Results are also presented as a percentage of protein recovery in which the protein content of each fraction is divided by the initial total protein content of the sample tested (after defatting).
