0: A Hunterlab spectrocolourimeter (MiniScan XE Plus, Reston Virginia, USA) was used to determine the colour of the LM and the three fractions (SLF, IFL and SF).
1: Equipment was set at illuminant D65, 22 mm aperture, and 10 observer.
2: Calibration was run using black and white tiles in accordance with the standard manual.
3: The averages were used to calculate the change in colour  (E) using the following equation: (1)E=(L2+a2+b2) where: L* value indicates lightness, a* value indicates red/green colour and b* value represents the yellow/blue colour of the sample.
