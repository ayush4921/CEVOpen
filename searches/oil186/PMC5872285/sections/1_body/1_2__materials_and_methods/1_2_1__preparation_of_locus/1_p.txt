0: Whole adult  Locusta migratoria (4 weeks) were donated by Otago Locusts, Dunedin, NZ.
1: The locusts were reared in large plastic containers at a constant ambient temperature and light source.
2: The feed consisted of oat grass and ground oats.
3: Live locusts were hand harvested into small containers and placed into a 18 C freezer overnight.
4: Whole samples were freeze-dried (Freezezone 12 Plus, Labconco, Kansas, MO, USA) and ground to produce locust meal (LM).
5: Defatted locust meal (DLM) was prepared by dispersing LM in hexane (1:5,  w/ v) and stirred for three hours using a magnetic stirrer (S-12BB, Jeio Tech Ltd., Seoul, South Korea), with renewal of hexane every hour.
6: The mixture was filtered thrice, and dried in a fume hood to remove any remaining organic solvent.
7: LM and DLM were stored in a desiccator at room temperature until analysis.
8: General chemical materials used in the study were analytical grade and acquired from Thermo Fisher, Sciresby, VIC, Australia.
