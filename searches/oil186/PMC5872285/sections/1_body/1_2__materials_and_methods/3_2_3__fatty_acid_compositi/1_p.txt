0: FA composition was determined from fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), prepared following a modified method of Van Wijngaarden [ 26].
1: Locust oil (20 mg) and internal standard (C17:0; 10 mg/mL) was mixed with methanolic KOH and heated for 20 min at 80 C in a heating block (Grant BT3, Grant Instruments Ltd., Cambridge, UK).
2: After addition of diethyl ether (2 mL) and water (5 mL), the bottom layer was acidified using HCl (36.538%) and a further aliquot of diethyl ether (2 mL) was added.
3: The diethyl ether upper phase was added into boron triflouride-methanol solution (2 mL; BF 3 14% in methanol, Sigma-Aldrich Inc.,St Louis, MO, USA) and again heated for 20 min at 80 C. After addition of saturated NaCl (5 mL) the FAME upper layer was collected and analysed using gas chromatography-flame ionisation detection (Agilent 6890N GC with an Agilent 7683 series auto sampler; Agilent Technologies Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA).
4: Sample (1 L) was injected in a split mode of 20:1.
5: Hydrogen, with a flow rate of 2.2 mL/min was used as the carrier gas, and separation was achieved using SGE BPX-70 column (50 m  0.32 mm ID  0.25 m films; SGE, Melbourne, Australia).
6: The column oven increased from 120 C to 225 C at a rate of 3 C/min, then increased 10 C/min to reach a final temperature of 245 C, with a hold of 2 min, reaching a max temp of 270 C (total run time 39 min).
7: The injector and flame ionisation detector were 240 C and 250 C respectively.
8: The FA were identified using the FAME reference standard (FAMQ-005, Accustandard Inc., New Haven, CT, USA).
9: Duplicates of three crude oil samples were conducted.
