0: Moreover, locusts are nutritionally rich in protein, fiber, and essential fatty acids.
1: Compositional data concerning locusts is scarce and exact values are highly variable depending on species, habitat, diet, metamorphic stage, and processing method.
2: Orthopteran species contain high amounts of fat averaging around 13% (dry weight basis), with promising amounts of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA); omega-3 (-linolenic acid) and omega-6 (linoleic acid) [ 4].
3: Moreover, insects are particularly noted for their high protein content.
4: Orthopteran species can range from 15% to 81% protein [ 5], with averages around 50% to 65% for  Locusta migratoria [ 6, 7, 8].
5: Orthopteran species also contain satisfactory ratios of essential amino acids recommended for human consumption, making them a sustainable protein option for consumers looking for alternatives to traditional meat sources such as beef [ 5].
6: Yet, some studies have recognised the potential overestimation of insect protein contents when the nitrogen to protein conversion for meat (6.25) is used [ 9, 10, 11].
7: The high amount of chitin, a non-protein nitrogen (NPN) polysaccharide found in the exoskeleton of insects, can cause an overestimation of digestible protein documented in literature.
8: To more accurately determine insect protein content, Jonas-Levi and Martinez [ 10] recommended subtracting NPN from the total nitrogen content, or lowering the conversion factor.
9: Nonetheless, the high protein and fat content of insects and locusts is comparable to traditional meat sources, indicating potential as a meat or protein alternative for the growing population [ 2, 12].
