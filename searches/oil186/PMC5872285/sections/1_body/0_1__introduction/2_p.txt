0: Rearing locusts and other edible insects requires significantly less feed, land, and water compared to livestock production, which is known to have a significant impact on the environment where greenhouse gas emissions are minimal with only cockroaches, termites and scarab beetles that emit methane gas [ 2, 3].
1: Locusts have short life cycles in which adulthood can be reached at four to eight weeks depending on rearing conditions.
2: They can also increase their numbers 10 to 16-fold between each generation, illustrating the rapid and efficient domestic rearing prospects [ 1].
3: Land required for rearing is minimal as they can be farmed vertically.
4: The cold-blooded insects obtain moisture from their food decreasing water requirements, and along with the high feed conversion efficiency, insects resource requirements are lower compared to other traditional livestock such as beef [ 2].
