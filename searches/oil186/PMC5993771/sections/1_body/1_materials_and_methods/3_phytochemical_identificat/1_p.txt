0: The identification of the active compounds of the  R. officinalis essential oil was carried out by Agilent 2890 HP-type gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (Model 6890) (GC/MS), equipped with a fused silica HP-5MS capillary column (Length: 30 m, internal diameter: 0.25 mm, and film thickness 0.25 m).
1: The temperature of the injector was maintained at 250C.
2: The carrier gas was helium (0.5 ml/min) with an injection volume of 0.2 l, and the division ratio was adjusted to 1:20.
3: The oven temperature was programmed from 60 (8 min) to 280C at 2C/min and then held isothermally at 280C for 10 min.
4: Analysis mode: Digitized, interface temperature: 280C, ionization type: Electronic, filament strength: 70 eV, mass analyzer type: Quadrupole, source temperature: 230C, and empty: 65m torr.
