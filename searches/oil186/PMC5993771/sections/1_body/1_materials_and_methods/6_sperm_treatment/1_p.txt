0: The pooled sperm was diluted at 1/2 ratio at room temperature (18-22C) in Tris extender (3.028 g of hydroxymethylaminomethane, 1.25 g of fructose, 1.7 g of citric acid, 800 Ul/ml of penicillin G sodium, and 1 mg/ml of streptomycin sulfate in 100 ml of distilled water) and then split into four equal aliquots.
1: Each aliquot was diluted with Tris extender supplemented with 870, 87, or 8.7 g/ml of  R. officinalis essential oil, identified as treatments R, R5, and R10, respectively (26).
2: Tris-based extender without any supplementation was considered as a control group.
3: All samples were then stored at 4C and analyzed at 0, 6, 24, and 48 h. The experimentation was repeated 6 times (n=6).
