0: Various sperm motility parameters were analyzed using a CASA (Sperm class analyzer, SCA Microptic, S.L., Version 3.2.0, Barcelona, Spain).
1: The measured parameters were: Percentage of motile spermatozoa (Mob T %), percentage of progressive spermatozoa (Prog T %), curvilinear velocity (VCL m/s), straight line velocity (VSL m/s), average path velocity (VAP m/s), amplitude of the lateral head displacement (ALH m), and frequency to which the sperm head crosses the mean trajectory (beat-cross frequency [BCF]/Hertz).
