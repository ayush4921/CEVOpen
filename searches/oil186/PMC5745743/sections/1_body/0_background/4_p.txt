0: One of the main causes for difficulties in the bioactivity study of  O. fragrans var.
1: thunbergii essential oil is the complexity of its chemical composition.
2: Recently, complex network approach has emerged in the pharmacological researches, which was also known as network pharmacology or system pharmacology [ 14,  15].
3: This methodology holds a significant potential for extracting biological information from large amounts of chemical data [ 16], and enables to predict the target profiles and pharmacological actions of herbal compounds [ 17,  18].
4: For instance, Chandran et al.
5: performed a network to evaluate the immunomodulatory activity of  Withania somnifera, and revealed a series of novel bioactive immune target combinations.
6: Chen et al.
7: constructed a multi-parameter network model on the basis of three important parameters to tentatively explain the anti-fibrosis mechanism of herbal medicine  Sophora flavescens [ 19].
8: Luo et al.
9: used systems pharmacology strategies for anticancer drug discovery based on natural products [ 20].
10: In addition,  Gogoi et al.
11: developed a network pharmacology-based virtual screening of natural products from  Clerodendrum species for identification of novel anti-cancer therapeutics [ 21].
12: These studies demonstrate that complex network approach has real potential for bioactivity study of natural products [ 22,  23].
