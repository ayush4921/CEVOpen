0: In this study, we applied the complex network method to evaluate the main active ingredients and bioactivities of  O. fragrans var.
1: thunbergii essential oil.
2: GC-MS was used to analyze ingredients of this essential oil.
3: An ingredient-target-pathway network was constructed, and that statistical characteristics of the network were calculated to determine the key nodes.
4: The nodes associated with the key pathway were extracted and reorganized as a core subnetwork to explore the underlying mechanism.
5: Furthermore, a pathway-based protein association network was also built to investigate interrelationships between target proteins of  O. fragrans var.
6: thunbergii essential oil.
