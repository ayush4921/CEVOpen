0: GC-MS was used to analyze chemical ingredients of  O. fragrans var.
1: thunbergii essential oil.
2: The essential oil was diluted in  n-hexane (99%, GC grade, Sigma-Aldrich), and filtrated using a 0.22 m filter.
3: A blank ( n-hexane) was prepared equally as the essential oil sample, and used as control sample.
4: A measure of 1 L sample was injected into a Trace 1300 GC coupled with an ISQ LT MS (Thermo, USA).
5: Chromatographic separation was accomplished on a TG-5 column (30 m  0.25 mm i.d.
6: ; film thickness: 0.25 m; Thermo, USA).
7: Temperature programming was set to 60 C held for 2 min, then rose to 120 C at 3 C/min, maintained for 4 min, finally increased to 290 C at 3 C/min and held for 2 min.
8: The inlet temperature was kept at 280 C and ion source temperature was 270 C. Helium was used as carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1 mL/min.
9: Electron impact ionization source (70 eV) was used at full scan mode ( m/z 50-550).
