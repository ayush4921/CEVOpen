0: Dried kernels (ca.
1: 1 g) were finely chopped and extracted with chloroform and methanol (2:1) followed by agitation at room temperature for one hour.
2: The mixture was then centrifuged for 5 min at 3500 rpm and the whole process was repeated twice.
3: The lipid extracts were mixed with boron trifluoride (BF 3)-methanol reagent (20%) and fatty acids were derivatized to fatty acid methyl esters [ 20].
4: The methyl esters of the fatty acids were dissolved in heptane and analyzed by GC-MS (Shimadzu QP2010, Shimadzu Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).
5: The GC conditions were as follows: Restek stabilwax capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm ID  0.5 m film thickness) (Restek Corporation, Bellefonte, PA, USA); oven temperature program: the column held initially at 100 C after injection and the final temperature was increased to 250 C, total program time was 39:00 min; injector temperature: 250 C; carrier gas: Helium; linear gas velocity: 42.7 cm/s; column flow: 1.10 mL/min; split ratio: 50.00; injection volume: 1.0 L. MS conditions were regulated as follows: ion source temperature: 200 C; interface temperature: 250 C; mass range: 35500 atomic mass units.
6: Identification of the compounds was carried out by comparison of their retention times and mass spectra with corresponding data from a standard food industry FAME Mix (Restek Corporation, Bellefonte, PA, USA).
7: A total of 32 individual compounds were analyzed and only the detected ones were recorded along with their quantity compared with the standard.
