0: Accurately weighed 0.3 g of dried  T. ferdinandiana kernels were taken into teflon vessels of microwave digestion system (MarsXpress, CEM, Matthews, NC, USA) and high-purity nitric acid (70%  w/ w, 4 mL) was added [ 21].
1: The samples were left overnight at room temperature for slow digestion gasses to evolve.
2: The vessels were sealed and microwave-digested at increased temperature with set digestion time [ 22].
3: The digested samples were diluted and made up to 40 mL with high-purity water (Milli-Q Element system, Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA).
4: The levels of minerals and trace elements were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Vista AX, Varian Australia, Mulgrave, Victoria, Australia), to measure lower levels and for greater sensitivity the analysis was carried out using ICP-MS (7500a, Agilent, Tokyo, Japan).
5: The ICP-MS was equipped with an auto-sampler, integrated sample introduction system and a helium octopole reaction cell to remove polyatomic interferences ( 40Ag  35Cl on  75As).
6: The operating conditions were as follows: radio frequency (RF) power 1350W, argon carrier gas 0.8 L/min and helium reaction cell gas flow rate 4.5 mL/min.
7: The standard reference materials were used for the quality control and assurance and treated similarly to the samples throughout the study.
8: The data of quality control and assurance are presented in the  Supplementary Material (Table S1).
