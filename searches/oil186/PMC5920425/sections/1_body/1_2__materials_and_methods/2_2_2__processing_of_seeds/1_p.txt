0: The frozen seeds were thawed, washed and cleaned manually several times to remove the pulp residues with double distilled water.
1: The seeds were then dried in the oven for 48 h at 40 C. After drying, the seeds were individually cracked using an Engineers vice size 125 (DAWN, Melbourne, Australia) to release the kernels from the seedcoats.
2: The seedcoats and kernels were kept, processed and analyzed separately.
3: The kernels were kept in air-tight containers and placed at 20 C for further analysis.
4: A flowchart depicting the processing of the seeds is illustrated in  Figure 2.
5: During the processing of fruits in the industry in a batch of 100 kg of fruits, 22 kg of seeds can be obtained as by-product.
6: The average weight of a dry seed is 0.5 g and the moisture content is 2.8%.
7: Average weight of a kernel is 0.04 g. The kernel is 8% of the weight of the seed.
8: 1 kg of dry seeds can deliver 80 g of kernels.
