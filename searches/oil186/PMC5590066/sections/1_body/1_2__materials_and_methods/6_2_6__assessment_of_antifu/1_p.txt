0: The fungi samples were obtained from the Leibniz Institute (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany).
1: The fungal species tested in this study were  Botrytis cinerea DSM-5144,  Rhizopus stolonifer DSM-2194,  Verticillium dahliae DSM-11938,  Aspergillus niger DSM-1957, and  Colletotrichum gloeosporioides DSM-62146.
2: The culture of fungal species was made on Potato-Dextrose-Agar (PDA) slants purchased from VWR (Strasbourg, France).
3: The storage temperature was 4 C. After 10 days of culture, the fungi spore were obtained, then blended with sterile distilled water to get a spore suspension of 1  10 8 spore/mL.
4: The concentrations of EO solutions were reached from 0.1 to 3 mg/mL.
5: The disc diffusion method [ 16] was adopted to evaluate the antifungal activity.
6: Five microliters (5 L) of EO was used.
7: Inhibition percent was obtained by Equation (3):  (3)Inhibition (%)=1radial growth of treatment radial growth of control 100.
