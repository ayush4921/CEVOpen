0: The EO was solvated in  n-pentane (Sigma-Aldrich, St Quentin Fallavier, France) (10%  v/ v) and construed on a Clarus 500 (Perkin Elmer Instruments, Shelton, USA) gas chromatograph outfit with a fused-silica capillary column HP-5MS (5% diphenyl 95% dimethyl polydimethylsiloxane, 30 m length, 0.25 mm id, 0.25 m film thickness (J&W scientific, Folsom, CA).
1: Flame ionization detector (FID) (Perkin Elmer Instruments, Shelton, CT, USA) was used.
2: The importer gas was helium (1.3 mL/min flow).
3: The injection volume was 0.5 L. Injector temperature was 250 C and under split mode at a ratio of 1:5.
4: The temperature of FID was 250 C. The furnace temperature was programmed at 60 C for 5 min, grated to 250 C at 5 C/min and maintained at 250 C for 5 min.
5: The identification of compounds was built on retention indices (RI) qualified to C5-C18 n-alkanes (Sigma-Aldrich, St Quentin Fallavier, France) and available literature data [ 15, 16] and on computer matching of obtained fragments from mass spectrum with those present in NIST 2008 and WILEY 275L MS libraries.
6: Results are the mean from at least three independent experiments performed in six replicates.
