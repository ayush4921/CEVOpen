0: Antibacterial assay was carried using agar well diffusion.
1: The bacteria were cultured for 18 h at 37 C on the slant agar (Oxoid, CM325).
2: Adjustment of washed cell bacteria was carried out according to McFarland No.
3: 0.5 standard [ 17].
4: Into 90 mm diameter Petri plates, 10 mL of each bacteria culture were pipetted.
5: To fill the wells (6 mm in diameter), agar was pressed with 10 L of ethanolic solutions contained 5 g/mL of EO.
6: Ethanol was used to dissolve the oil for negative controls preparation.
7: Susceptibility test disc Ceftazidime/Clavulanic Acid, CAZ-CLA, 30/10 g (BBL, CAZ/CLA, 231753) was used as a positive control.
8: Incubation time of plates was 24 h at 37 C. Antibacterial effect was assessed by the diameter of clear zones developed around wells.
9: Results are the mean (SEM) from at least three independent experiments performed in triplicates.
