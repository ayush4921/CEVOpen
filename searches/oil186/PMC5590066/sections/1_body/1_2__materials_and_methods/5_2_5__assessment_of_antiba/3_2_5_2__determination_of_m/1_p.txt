0: MIC was determined on the base of a microdilution broth susceptibility test [ 18].
1: All tests were made in Mueller Hinton Broth (MHB; BBL) (Microbiology Systems, Inc., Cockeysville, MD, USA) supplemented with Tween 80 detergent (Fisher, Illkirch, France) to achieve a final concentration of 0.5% ( v/ v).
2: The culture of bacteria was made overnight at 37 C in Mueller Hinton Agar, MHA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Quentin Fallavier, France).
3: To obtain a final density of 5  10 5 cfu/mL, tests were hanging in MHB.
4: To obtain a final concentration values reaching from 0-1000 g/mL of EO in MHB, dilutions were prepared in a 96-well microplates (Sarstedt, Numbrecht, Germany).
5: Growth control was (MHB + Tween 80) and sterility control was (MHB + Tween 80 + sample).
6: The microplates were smoldered at 37 C during 24 h. A microplate reader (Multiskan Ascent, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK) was used to the bacterial growth determination.
7: The reading absorbance was 620 nm.
8: The MICs represent the concentrations of EO causing at least 50% growth inhibition of the bacterial strains.
9: Results are the mean (SEM) from at least three independent experiments performed in triplicates.
