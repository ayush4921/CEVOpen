0: The preparation of samples is obtained by mixing sunflower oil with 0.05% or 0.1% or 0.2% amounts of EO.
1: In the Oxipres apparatus (Mikrolab, Aarhus, Denmark), 5 g of sunflower oil were placed inside a reactor tube heated at 110 C under an oxygen pressure of 5 bar.
2: The variations in pressure occurred were recorded.
3: The control sample not contain additive.
4: After the addition of each dose of EO, all variations of induction period ( IP) of sunflower oil were collected with time (h).
5: 3,5-di-tert-4-butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Quentin Fallavier, France) was used as a positive control.
6: The AA of EO and the protection factor ( PF) variations of sunflower oil were determined by Equations (1) and (2):  (1)PF=IPxIPk(2)AA=IPxIPkIPBHTIPk where  IP  X is the induction period of the sample with additive,  IP  K is the induction period of the sample without additive,  IP  BHT is the induction period of the sample with synthetic antioxidant BHT.
