1: A. millefolium (common yarrow) has been used in many applications such as medicine, veterinary science, and cosmetics [ 4].
2: The flowering herbs were reported as possessing tonic, antispasmodic, vulnerary, and diaphoretic activities, among others, and therefore is recommended for colds, flatulence, hysteria, and rheumatism treatments [ 5].
3: The chemical composition of  A. millefolium oils from Quebec [ 6], India [ 7], Turkey [ 3], Iran [ 8], and European countries (Macedonia, Italy, Lithuania, Hungary, Greece, Moldavia, Latvia, Germany Estonia, Belgium, France, Russia, Armenia, Spain, and Bulgaria) [ 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] has been reported in previous studies.
4: However, the reports on antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of  A. millefolium EO are rather scarce.
5: Considering remarkable chemical polymorphism, which is characteristic of many essential oil-bearing plants, it is of interest to determine the chemical composition and biological activities of plant varieties growing in different regions.
