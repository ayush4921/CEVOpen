0: The EO was analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) (GC/MS) (PolarisQ ion trap MS).
1: Hence, analyses were performed on a Hewlett-Packard (HP 6890) gas chromatograph (flame ionization detector [FID]).
2: The temperature was programmed from 50C after 5 min initial hold to 200C at 4C/min.
3: Chromatography carrier gas was N 2 (1.8 ml/min), split mode was used (flow: 72.1 ml/min.
4: ratio: 1/50), temperature of injector and detector was 250C, and final hold time was 48 min.
5: The machine was led by a computer system type HP ChemStation, managing its functioning and allowing to follow the evolution of chromatographic analyses.
6: Diluted samples (1/20 in methanol) of 1 l were injected manually.
