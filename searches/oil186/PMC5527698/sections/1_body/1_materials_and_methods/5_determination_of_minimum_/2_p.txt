0: For yeasts, the microdilution assay was conducted according to the protocol previously described by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute[ 6] with slight modifications.
1: First, the EO was serially diluted in YPG broth, supplemented with agar at 0.15% (w/v), to achieve final concentrations ranging between 4 and 0.003% (v/v).
2: The 12 th well was also considered as growth control.
3: Then, 50 l of inoculum was added to each well at final concentration of 10 3 CFU/ml.
4: Finally, the microplate was incubated at 30C for 48 h.
