0: The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined in 96-well microplate using the microdilution assay according to Balouiri  et al.
1: [ 5] with slight modifications.
2: Bacteriological agar at 0.15% (w/v) was used as an emulsifier of the EO in the culture medium.
3: For bacteria, the EO was serially diluted in Muller-Hinton broth supplemented with agar to obtain final concentrations ranging between 8% and 0.007% (v/v).
4: The 12 th well was considered as growth control (free-EO control).
5: Then, 50 l of bacterial inoculum, previously prepared and adjusted to 0.5 McFarland, were added to each well to reach the final concentration of 10 6 CFU/ml.
6: After incubation at 37C for 24 h, 10 l of resazurin was added to each well as bacterial growth indicator.
7: After a further incubation at 37C for 2 h, the bacterial growth was revealed by coloration change from purple to pink.
