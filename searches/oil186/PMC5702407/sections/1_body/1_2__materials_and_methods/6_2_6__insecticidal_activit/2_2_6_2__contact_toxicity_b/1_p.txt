0: The contact insecticidal activity of EOs obtained from mint timija against  T. confusum adults was determined by assessing the toxicity using filter paper discs (Whatman number 1, 9 cm diameter) as described by Kasrati et al.
1: [ 7].
2: Oils were dissolved in acetone at concentrations of 0.09, 0.16, 0.24, and 0.31  L/cm 2.
3: Several preliminary tests were conducted to select the doses to be used for each EO.
4: One mL of each solution was dispensed on the surface of the filter paper that was then placed in a glass Petri dish.
5: Control filter papers were treated with acetone only.
6: After 10 min, once the solvent had been evaporated, 10 unsexed adults were deposited into each dish.
7: Each EO and control treatment was replicated three times, repeating each assay twice.
8: Mortality was recorded after 24 hours.
