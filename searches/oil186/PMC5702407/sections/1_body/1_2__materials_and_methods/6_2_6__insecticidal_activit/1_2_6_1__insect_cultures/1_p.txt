0: We followed the methods of Kasrati et al.
1: [ 7].
2: Colonies of the red flour beetle,  Tribolium confusum (du Val) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), were maintained in the laboratory without exposure to any insecticide.
3: They were reared in glass containers (16 cm diameter  22 cm height) covered by a fine mesh cloth for ventilation.
4: Each container contained a mixture of wheat flour, wheat germ, and yeast extract (13 : 6 : 1 w/w/w).
5: The cultures were maintained in a growth chamber at 26  1C, with a relative humidity (RH) of 7085% and 16 : 8 h light : dark photoperiod.
6: Only young adults (714 days old) were used for the tests.
7: All experimental procedures were conducted under environmental conditions identical to those of the cultures.
8: In all bioassays, insects where considered dead when no leg or antennal movements were observed.
9: The bioassays were designed to assess median lethal concentrations (LC 50 and LC 90 values) (doses that killed 50% and 90% of the exposed insects, resp.
10: ).
