0: In February 2012, a total of 400 stem cuttings of  M. suaveolens subsp.
1: timija (vegetative stage) were randomly sampled from the natural population located in the Marrakech region, Ourika valley (3123N742W; altitude: 900 m).
2: The species identification was done by one of the authors (A. Abbad) and a voucher specimen (MST05) was deposited at the Laboratory of Biotechnology, Protection and Valorization of Plant Resources, Faculty of Science Semlalia, Marrakech, Morocco.
3: The prepared cuttings (length 20 cm) were immediately transplanted to the main field in a randomized complete block design.
4: Twenty-five cuttings were transplanted in each block (2 m  2 m) with plant to plant and row to row spacing of 40 cm.
5: One meter alley was maintained between treatments to eliminate any influence of lateral water movement.
6: At the time of transplantation, the treatments were applied.
7: Each treatment was replicated three times.
8: Two treatments consisting of application of a complete mineral fertilizer using the N, P, and K fertilizer (60 kg/ha of N, P 2O 5, and K2O with 13 : 40 : 13 formulation) [ 21] and inoculation with 50 g/plant of  Glomus sp.
9: soil were conducted.
10: Culture of  Glomus sp.
11: was kindly provided by Sfairi (high commissariat for water and forests and desertification in Morocco).
12: Blocks containing the crop without any treatment were taken as control.
13: For the first month (establishment phase), the crop was watered on alternate days.
14: Thereafter, the irrigation was carried out as needed, depending on the rainfall.
15: The plants were harvested at the beginning of flowering stage, 10 weeks after application of treatments.
16: The mycorrhizal colonization of the randomized mint timija plants was determined by staining of colonized roots with trypan blue according to the method of Phillips and Hayman [ 22].
