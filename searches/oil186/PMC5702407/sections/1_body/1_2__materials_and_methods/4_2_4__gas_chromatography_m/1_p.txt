0: The GC/MS analysis of EOs was performed in an Agilent GC-MSD system (Agilent Technologies 6890/5973) with helium (high purity) as the carrier gas at a constant linear velocity of 37 cm/s.
1: The transfer, source, and quadrupole temperatures were 280C, 230C, and 150C, respectively, operating at 70 eV ionisation energy and scanning the  m/ z range 41450.
2: The column used was an Agilent DB5 ms capillary column (30.0 m  0.25 mm ID  0.25  m film thickness; model number: 122-5532) programmed from 60C to 246C at 3C/min.
3: EO samples (60  L) were diluted with acetone (2 mL).
4: The injection volume was 1.0  L, the split ratio was 1 : 50, and the injector temperature was 260C.
5: Identification of the individual components was based on (i) comparison with the mass spectra of authentic reference compounds where possible and with reference to WILEY275, NBS75 K, and Adams terpene library [ 23] and (ii) comparison of their retention indices (RI) on a DB5 (apolar, 5% phenyl polysilphenylene-siloxane), calculated relative to the retention times of a series of C-9 to C-24  n-alkanes, with linear interpolation, with those of authentic compounds or literature data.
6: For semiquantitative purposes, the normalized peak area of each compound was used without any correction factors to establish abundances.
