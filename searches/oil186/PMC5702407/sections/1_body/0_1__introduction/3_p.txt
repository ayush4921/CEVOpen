0: It is well known that many factors and practices related to cultivation can improve the growth and EO quality of many aromatic plants [ 11].
1: Among these practices, application of mineral and biological fertilizers, such as N, P, and K amendments and mycorrhizal inoculation have been recommended [ 12,  13].
2: In fact, the use of these cultural practices has many advantages, which include promoting the physical and biological properties of soil [ 14], stimulating plant growth and biomass yield through improving nutrient uptake [ 15], and enhancing the content and quality of EOs via modulation of the levels of enzymes that participate in the biosynthesis of volatile terpenes [ 16].
