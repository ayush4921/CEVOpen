0: All the fluorescence spectra of ghee samples were pre-processed before analysis using Savitzky-Golay smoothing method (order 5, 13-point window) in MATLAB (Mathworks, release 2014) environment through a self-written code.
1: This has been employed to remove random noise evolving during recording the spectra.
2: After smoothing, the emission spectra highlighted peaks confirming the presence of different molecular structures in the buffalo ghee.
3: In addition, all emission spectra were vector normalization for the better comparison and analysis of different molecular bands.
4: Further, classification of small spectral variations induced as a result of heating was obtained by applying principal component analysis (PCA), a widely used statistical tool through a MatLab built-in routine.
5: As a result of PCA, resulting classification in the heated and non-heated ghee samples are explained by scatter plots between first two principal components PC1 and PC2 in the relevant sections.
