0: In order to make heated sample of buffalo ghee, an experiment was performed in which an egg was fried with desi ghee in a frying pan with a controlled heat supply.
1: Gas burner was used for the heat supply and the flame was kept at low value so as to achieve a possible constant heat supply to the frying pan and to avoid rapid temperature changes.
2: The frying pan was moved up and down slowly in an effort to maintain the required temperature.
3: The purpose of this experiment was to monitor the time and temperature taken by an egg to get fried.
4: 100 grams of buffalo ghee was heated in a frying pan up to a temperature of 140C and an egg was poured in pan at this temperature.
5: Before pouring egg in frying pan, heated ghee of quantity 3 ml was sampled for acquiring its fluorescence spectra.
6: Immediately, after pouring the egg, the temperature of ghee dropped down to around 120C and it took around one minute to rise back to 140C and then continued towards 150C.
7: A temperature ranges from 140150C was maintained to get the egg fully fried and whole process took around five minutes.
8: After five minutes frying at this temperature range, egg got fully fried and its corners turned light brown and at 150C heated ghee of quantity 3 ml was sampled again for acquiring fluorescence spectra.
9: Further heating of ghee with egg in frying pan causes the egg to turn dark brown from light brown around temperature 180C and then black around temperature of 200C.
10: It shows that food cooked at this temperature and above loses its nutritional values and got oxidized.
