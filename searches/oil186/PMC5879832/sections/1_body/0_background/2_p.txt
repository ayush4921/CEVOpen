0: The species composition, richness and diversity of the fish gut microbiome has been studied extensively in fish species that are interesting for the aquaculture industry mainly with the interest of improving fish health through enhanced feed.
1: Commonly used methods include cultivation and/or molecular profiling with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) [ 15].
2: Based on the increasing use of next-generation sequencing techniques a diverse gut microbiome composition has been detected in fish [ 16,  17].
3: While next-generation sequencing [ 18] indicated changes in the intestinal community of a freshwater fish (goldfish,  Carassius auratus) upon exposure to an environmental pollutant (pentachlorophenol), studies investigating such effect in marine fish are lacking.
4: Herein, we report the effect of oil exposure on the intestinal microflora in Atlantic cod.
5: The aim of this study was to assess the potential shift in gut bacterial community composition of Atlantic cod due to oil exposure.
6: The intestinal bacterial community composition, as analyzed by Illumina sequencing of V4 amplicons of bacterial 16S rRNA genes, was compared among gut microbiota of fish after a 28-day exposure to four levels of oil concentration (i.e., no oil, 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1 mg/L).
7: Results from biological effect measurement, i.e.
8: PAH metabolite analysis in fish bile, were used to confirm metabolic uptake of oil by the fish [ 2].
