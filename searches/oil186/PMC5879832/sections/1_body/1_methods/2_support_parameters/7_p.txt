0: GC-MS analysis was carried out as previously described [ 24,  25].
1: In brief, the OH-PAHs were extracted with ethylacetate, dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate and concentrated prior to sylilation with N,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSFTA).
2: Trimethylsilyl (TMS) ethers of OH-PAHs were analysed using an HP5890 series II gas chromatograph (Shimadzu QP2010) equipped with a CP-Sil 8 CB-MS (Varian) column.
3: Mass spectra were obtained at 70 eV in selected ion mode (SIM).
