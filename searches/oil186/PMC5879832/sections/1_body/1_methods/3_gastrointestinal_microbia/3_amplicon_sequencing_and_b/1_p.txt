0: Amplicon libraries were prepared using BioScientifics NEXTflex V4 library preparation kit following the manufacturers instructions with minor modifications.
1: All DNA samples were diluted 10 times prior to first PCR step.
2: Primer and barcode sequences are shown as additional file [see Additional file  2].
3: Instead of the recommended 10 cycles, 25 cycles were used during the first PCR reaction in order to obtain sufficient amount of products.
4: PCR clean-up was then performed using MinElute Column Clean-up kit (Qiagen) and cleaned reaction mixes were diluted.
5: The second PCR step was performed using 25 cycles as well.
6: Approximately 40 L of PCR products were loaded on a 2% agarose gel, bands corresponding to expected product size were excised and the second cleanup step was performed with MinElute Gel Extraction kit (Quiagen).
7: DNA concentration was then measured with a NanoVue instrument (GE Healthcare).
8: Products from three repeated library preparation rounds were pooled together prior to amplicon sequencing.
9: Finally, the amplicons were sequenced by the Norwegian Sequencing Center (NSC) using Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) V3 chemistry reagents (600 cycle, paired end).
10: PhiX was blended in at 30% and a maximum of 1 bp mismatch was allowed during demultiplexing.
11: All sequences have been deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), acc.
12: nr.
13: PRJEB21667.
