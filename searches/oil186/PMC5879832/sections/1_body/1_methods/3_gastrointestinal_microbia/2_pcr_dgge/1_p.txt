0: Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) was carried out on all individual genomic DNA samples and on pooled genomic DNA samples which were from the same exposure group.
1: The V3-V5 region of the 16S rDNA was amplified as described previously [ 26] (forward primer 341f: 5-CCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3 with a GC-clamp 5- CGCCCGGGGCGCGCCCCGGGCGGGGCGGGGGCACGGGGGG-3 attached at the 5-end and reverse primer 907r: 5- CCGTCAATTCMTTTGAGTTT-3).
2: Each 50 L PCR mix was composed of molecular grade water, 5 L PCR buffer (5 Prime), 0.1 mM of each dNTPs, 10 pM of each primer, 1 L of genomic DNA and 0.25 L of Taq polymerase (5 U/L, 5 Prime).
3: The PCR program was as follows: initial activation at 94 C for 2 min, followed by 25 cycles of: (1) denaturation at 94 C for 30 s, (2) annealing at 55 C for 40 s and (3) elongation at 72 C for 1 min.
4: A final elongation step at 72 C for 7 min was also included.
5: The DGGE was carried out on a 6% acrylamide gel containing denaturing agents, urea and formamide, in a gradient of 2080% prepared by using the IngenyPhorU gradient former.
6: Equal amounts of PCR products were loaded into each well (confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis).
7: The run was performed using an IngenyPhorU (Ingeny International BV, Goes, The Netherlands) system (17 L volume, 1 x TAE as buffer, temperature at 60 C) at 90 V for 18 h. Bands were visualized using post-staining (GelRed in TAE) for 60 min prior to imaging.
