0: The GI tract of three fishes from each exposure group were used for microbial community composition analysis.
1: After thawing on ice, each GI tract sample was cut into small pieces using sterile scissors and tweezer and placed in 15 mL sterile tubes with 3 mL ATL lysis buffer (Qiagen).
2: Samples were vortexed vigorously several times and kept at room temperature (approx.
3: 22 C), then centrifuged briefly at 10,000 rpm.
4: The liquid phase was decanted into a fresh 15 mL tube and contents were lysed overnight at 55 C. Following this overnight incubation, a 30 min RNA digestion was carried out at 37 C by adding 20 L RNAse A solution (100 mg/mL, Qiagen) to each sample.
5: DNA was then purified using phenol:chlorophorm:isoamylalcohol (PCI, 25:24:1, Sigma) extraction and ethanol precipitation.
6: Briefly, to each lysate (approx.
7: 3 mL), 5 mL of PCI was added and mixed vigorously.
8: Samples were kept on ice followed by centrifugation at 5000 rpm (4 C) for 15 min.
9: The supernatant was pipetted into a new tube before the extraction was repeated one more time with PCI (5 mL) and then once with 5 mL chlorophorm:isoamylalcohol (CI, 24:1, Sigma).
10: The DNA was finally precipitated with ice-cold ethanol (2 volumes of 100%) in the presence of sodium acetate (0.3 mM, pH 5.3).
11: Samples were gently mixed and then incubated at  20 C for a minimum of 4 h. Falcon tubes were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 30 min to collect the DNA pellet.
12: Ethanol was discarded, a washing step with 70% ethanol was carried out and pellets were re-suspended in Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.8).
13: Finally, an additional clean-up was performed using Genomic DNA Clean & Concentrator (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturers instructions, to completely remove inhibitors and resuspend DNA in molecular grade water.
