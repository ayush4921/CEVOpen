0: Atlantic cod (weight range of 1371455 g) were caught in MarchApril 2015 in the Stavanger region, transported to the International Research Institute of Stavanger facilities and placed in 1000 L tanks.
1: After a 12 weeks acclimation, fish were exposed to three different concentrations of dispersed crude oil from the Troll C platform (North Sea, Norway): low (0.01 mg/L) (n of fish = 8), medium (0.05 mg/L) (n of fish = 9) and high (0.1 mg/L) (n of fish = 6).
2: A group of fish were kept in a tank with clean seawater flow and used as control (n of fish = 7).
3: A constant flow of 8 L/min seawater into each tank was ensured in both control and exposed groups.
4: The crude oil was continuously distributed from a header tank (dispersed oil reservoir) into the different exposure tanks through a continuous flow system (CFS) as described earlier [ 19], in order to mimic natural environmental conditions, e.g., oil spill scenario .
5: Illustration of the CFS system is shown in an additional figure [see Additional file  1].
6: The CFS was checked daily, oil droplet sizes were monitored three times a week by Multisizer measurements, and PAH concentrations were measured semi quantitatively by fixed wavelength fluorescence (FF) weekly (data not reported).
7: A detailed description of the exposure set up can be found in the thesis of Delgado [ 20].
