0:  Diversity of microbial gut communities in Atlantic cod exposed to oil.
1: a Rarefaction curves of 16S rDNA sequences at the 97% similarity cut-off.
2: Specimens were exposed to increasing levels of oil exposure ( blue to red).
3: Curves are labelled with sample name (treatment level and fish specimen numbers).
4: All samples are normalized to the same sequencing depth.
5: b NMDS plot of all samples based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity.
6: Oil exposure treatment codes: Ctrl = Control, no oil, Low = low concentration of oil, Med = medium concentration of oil, High = high concentration of oil.
7: Fish from the lower and upper exposure groups are colored in red and blue tones, respectively, and fish specimen numbers are shown after treatment codes )  )  Fig.
