0:  Differences in oil exposure levels in Atlantic cod.
1: Oil exposure was assessed by multivariate analysis of PAH metabolite concentrations using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS).
2: The analysis is based on standardized polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolite levels in fish bile, generated using Euclidean distances between samples.
3: Fish subjected to the same oil exposure level are coloured identically.
4: Ctrl = control, Low = low oil concentration, Med = medium oil concentration, High = high oil concentration.
5: Numbers indicate sample (individual fish) numbers )  )  Fig.
