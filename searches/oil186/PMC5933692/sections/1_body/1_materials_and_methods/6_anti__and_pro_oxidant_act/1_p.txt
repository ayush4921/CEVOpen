0: To evaluate antioxidant activity, we have used DPPH Assay.
1: The antiradical efficiency of the sample was evaluated by the DPPH stable radical method [ 14,  15].
2: 100 L of sample, the essential oil of  G.  rosmarinifolia at different concentrations, was added to aliquots (3.9 mL) of a solution made up with DPPH (4.8 mg) in MeOH (200 mL), and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark.
3: Then the absorbance was measured at 517 nm using a UV-VIS spectrophotometer.
4: The initial concentration of DPPH was approximately 60 M. Lower absorbance values of reaction mixture indicate higher free radical scavenging activity.
5: The results were plotted as the percentage of absorbance disappearance at 517 nm [(1A/A0)  100] against the amount of sample divided by the initial concentration of DPPH.
6: Each point was acquired in triplicate.
7: ED 50 corresponds to micrograms of fraction able to consume half the amount of free radical divided by micromoles of initial DPPH.
8: The results were expressed as antiradical capacity (ARC), which is the inverse of ED 50.
