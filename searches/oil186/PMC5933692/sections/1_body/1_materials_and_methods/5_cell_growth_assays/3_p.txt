0: At time 0, the medium was replaced with fresh complete medium supplemented of essential at the indicated concentrations.
1: Following 72 h of treatment, 16 L of a commercial solution obtained from Promega Corporation (Madison, WI, USA) containing 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxy methoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulphophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) and phenazine ethosulfate were added.
2: The plates were incubated in a humidified atmosphere at 37 C in 5% CO 2 for 2 h, and the bioreduction of MTS dye was evaluated by measuring the absorbance of each well at 490 nm using a microplate absorbance reader (iMark Microplate Reader; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA).
3: Cell growth inhibition was expressed as a percentage (mean  SD) of the absorbance of the control cells.
