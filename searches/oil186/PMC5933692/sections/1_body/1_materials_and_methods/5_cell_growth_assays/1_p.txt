0: Hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HA22T/VGH, HepG2, Hep3B) and triple negative breast cancer cell lines (SUM 149, MDA-MB-231) were used.
1: The human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HA22T/VGH was kindly provided by Professor Massimo Levrero (Laboratory of Gene Expression, Fondazione Andrea Cesalpino, University of Rome La Sapienza, Rome, Italy).
2: HepG2 (ATCC : HB-8065 TM) and Hep3B (ATCC : HB-8064 TM) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA).
3: All the above cell lines were authenticated by short tandem repeat profiling (BMR Genomics, Padua, Italy).
4: The human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 (ATCC : HTB-26 TMRockville, MD, USA) and SUM149 (SUM149PTAsterand Bioscience Detroit, MI) were kindly provided by Dr. Elda Tagliabue (Molecular Targeting Unit, Department of Experimental Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Fondazione Institute of Hospitalization and Scientific Care, National Cancer Institute, Milan, Italy) and were authenticated using the short tandem repeat profiling method in their Institute facility.
