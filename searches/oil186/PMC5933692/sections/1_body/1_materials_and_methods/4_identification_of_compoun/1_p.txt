0: Identification of compounds was carried out using NIST 11, Wiley 9, FFNSC 2, and Adams [ 13] databases.
1: These identifications were confirmed by Linear Retention Indices (LRI) with those available in literature by SciFinder database.
2: Some of the compounds were also confirmed by comparison of mass spectra and retention times with standard compounds available in laboratory.
3: The retention indices were determined in relation to a homologous series of  n-alkanes (C 8-C 30) injected under the same operating conditions.
4: Component relative concentrations were calculated based on GC peak areas without using correction factors.
