0: The GC analysis was performed in an Agilent 7000C GC system, fitted with a fused silica Agilent HP-5MS capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm i.d.
1: ; 0.25 m film thickness), coupled to an Agilent triple quadrupole Mass Selective Detector MSD 5973; ionization voltage 70 eV; electron multiplier energy 2000 V; transfer line temperature, 295 C. Helium was the carrier gas (1 mL min -1).
2: The other GC analysis was performed in a Shimadzu QP 2010 plus, single quadrupole GC/MS system, fitted with a Supelcowax 10 capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm i.d.
3: ; 0.25 m film thickness); ionization voltage 70 eV; transfer line temperature, 280 C. Helium was the carrier gas (1 mL min -1).
4: For both columns, the temperature was initially kept at 40 C for 5 min, then gradually increased to 250C at 2C min -1 rate, held for 15 min and finally raised to 270 C at 10 C min -1.
5: One L of diluted samples (1/100 v/v, in  n-hexane) was injected at 250 C automatically and in the splitless mode; transfer line temperature, 295 C.
