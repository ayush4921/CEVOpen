0: The aim of this study was to identify the chemical composition of the essential oil of aerial parts (branches with leaves) of  G.  rosmarinifolia obtained by hydrodistillation (HD), analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and to verify some biological activities on a panel of hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HA22T/VGH, HepG2, Hep3B) and triple negative breast cancer cell lines (SUM 149, MDA-MB-231).
1: Both cancer models are highly aggressive with poor prognosis and are characterized by multi-drug resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs [ 11,  12].
2: It is therefore desirable to investigate new therapeutic tools to overcome the adverse biological characteristic and drug resistance of these tumor models.
