0: Microdilution tests were conducted according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), OPAS1 M27-A2 for yeasts and OPAS M7-A6 for bacteria according to literature [ 20] with slight modifications.
1: Briefly, MIC values were determined using micro titer plates (96 wells) in a total volume of 100.0 L. Microorganisms were cultured in test tubes filled with 3 mL of medium (RPMI 1640 for yeast and BHI for bacteria) overnight at 30 C in a rotary shaker (150 rpm).
2: The cultures were diluted and adjusted to 12  10 2 CFU/mL using a McFarland s scale.
3: The CFU counts and viability was confirmed by viability counts on YPD and BHI plates (100.0 L of diluted cells).
4: Crude essential oil and reference standards were serial diluted (two-fold) and added to each well.
5: A negative control containing medium only and growth control containing cell, DMSO (10.0 L), or saline (10.0 L) and Tween 80 were included as negative and positive controls, respectively.
6: Depending on the microorganism, the micro titer plates were then incubated at 30 C for 24 or 48 h. Microorganism growth was determined by reading the absorbance at 530 nm in a plate reader (Logen, MT-960, BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA), and the minimum inhibitory concentration was considered the lowest concentration at which at least 80% of growth was inhibited.
7: All tests were performed in triplicate.
