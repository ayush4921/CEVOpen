0: Yeasts were cultivated on agar plates containing Yeast Peptone Dextrose (YPD) (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose, and 2% agar) or RPMI 1640 (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA).
1: Gram-negative bacteria were grown in Luria Bertani (LB) (0.5% yeast extract, 1% tryptone, 1% NaCl, and 2% agar) and Gram-positive bacteria were tested in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) (Himedia, Mumbai, India).
2: Fluconazole (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA) was used as positive controls for yeast and chloramphenicol (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA) was the positive control for bacteria.
3: Crude essential oil from  Z. monogynum was diluted in DMSO or saline (0.9%) plus Tween 80 (0.5%) and spotted on 5 mm sterile filter paper [ 20].
