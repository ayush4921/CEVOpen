0: The oil was analyzed by GC (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) on a gas chromatograph Shimadzu GC 2010 Plus (FID detector) (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a DB-5 column (30 m  0.25 mm  0.25 m) (Agilent J&W GC Columns, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
1: GC-MS analysis were performed on a mass spectrometer GCMS-QP2010 (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) at 70 eV with a DB-5 column (same as above).
2: Oven temperature programmed from 60 C to 246 C at 3 C min 1.
3: For the injection (split 1:20), 5.0 L of the essential oil were diluted in 500.0 L of dichloromethane, and 1.0 L of this diluted solution was injected.
4: Identification of volatile constituents was made on the basis of their Kovats indexes (K.I.)
5: and their mass spectra, which were compared with reference data [ 18].
