0: To assess the antimicrobial activity of  Z. monogynum essential oil, the disk diffusion method described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, OPAS M2-A8) was used with some modification.
1: Thin agar plates with 10 mL of either YPD (yeast) or LB (Gram-negative) or BHI (Gram-positive) media supplemented with 2% agar were covered with 10 mL of soft agar medium (YPD, LB, or BHI plus 1% agar) containing 100 L of each fresh culture (adjusted to OD 600 = 0.3) of yeast or bacteria grown for 1216 h in 3 mL of liquid media incubated at 30 C/37 C with aeration (150 rpm).
2: After the agar was solidified, 5 mm filter paper disks sterilized and impregnated with 20 L of crude essential oil diluted in DMSO were placed on top of agar plates and incubated at 30 C/37 C for 24 or 48 h depending on the microorganism.
3: Fluconazole (1 mg) and chloramphenicol (200 g) impregnated disks were used as positive controls for yeast and bacteria, respectively.
4: Negative control was prepared by paper disks impregnating with DMSO at the same concentration employed to dilute the essential oil.
5: All tests were performed in duplicates.
6: Tested strains were selected based on their clinical importance and previous results obtained by our research group [ 20].
