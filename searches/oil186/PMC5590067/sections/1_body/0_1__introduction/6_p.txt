0: To date, there are no data in the literature about biological activities of the essential oil of  Z. monogynum.
1: The purpose of this study was (i) to give a chemical characterization of  Z. monogynum essential oil, (ii) to investigate its cytotoxic activity in vitro against six tumor cell lines (B16F10, MCF-7, A2058, HeLa, HL-60 and T75), and (iii) to determine the antimicrobial effect of  Z. monogynum essential oil against yeast ( Candida dubliniensis, Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Candida albicans, Cryptococcus grubii (Serotype A),  Cryptococcus gattii (Serotype B),  Cryptococcus gattii (Serotype C),  Cryptococcus neoformans (Serotype D),  Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains ( Escherichia coli,  Serratia marcescens,  Pseudomonas aeruginosa,  Staphylococcus epidermidis, and  Enterococcus faecalis).
