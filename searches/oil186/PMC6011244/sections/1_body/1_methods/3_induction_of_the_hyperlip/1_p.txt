0: Ninety-six male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 120~ 150 g were obtained from the Experimental Animal Center in Zhejiang, and the license number was SCXK (ZHE) 60080033.

2: All rats were fed a pelletized commercial chow for 7 days after arrival.
3: Hyperlipidemia was induced in the rats by feeding them a high-fat diet based on the AIN-93 semisynthetic diet; the detailed ingredients of the diet are shown in Table  1.
4: The obesity model was judged to be successful when the body weight in the intervention groups was 10% higher than that in the control group [ 20].
