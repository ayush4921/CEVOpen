0: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by broth microdilution method which deals with preparing two-fold dilutions of the antimicrobial agent ( 23).
1: A series of twofold dilutions were dispensed in 96-well microtitration plate (100 L in each well).
2: Then 10 L of inoculum containing 10 5 CFU/mL bacteria were added to each well and incubated at 37 C for 24 h. After incubation, 20 L of INT solution 0.5% (w/v) was added to the wells and the microplates were further incubated for 30 min at 37 C. A well-defined pink color in the wells signified positive microbial growth.
3: Finally, the lowest concentration of the formulation that prevented bacterial growth was recorded as the MIC value.
