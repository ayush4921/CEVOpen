0: To monitor the antimicrobial activities of MEO and nMEO, the disk diffusion method was employed ( 24).
1: Inoculate containing 10 5 CFU/mL bacteria was used to uniformly lawn Muller-Hinton agar plates.
2: The two-fold MEO dilutions ranging from 4000 to 250 g/100 L were prepared by dissolving them in 10% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) with 0.5% (v/v) Tween 80.
3: Muller-Hinton-broth with 0.5% (v/v) Tween 80 was used for preparing nMEO two-fold dilutions ranging from 2000 to 250 g/100 L. Empty sterilized discs (6.4 mm) were impregnated with 100 L of different concentrations and placed on the agar surface.
4: Paper disc moistened with 10% DMSO or empty niosome were used as a vehicle control and blank, respectively.
5: Also antibiotic discs including ciprofloxacin and gentamicin were used as positive controls.
6: After 24 h of incubation at 37 C, the zone of inhibition was measured.
