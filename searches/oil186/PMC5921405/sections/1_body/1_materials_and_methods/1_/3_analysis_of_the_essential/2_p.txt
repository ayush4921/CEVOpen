0: The components of the oil were identified by comparing their retention index (RI) with Kovats index (KI).
1: RI is relative to C8-C24 n-alkenes series injected to the GC/MS in the present study.
2: KI was obtained from mass spectra published by Adams ( 19).
3: Further identifications were made by matching the mass spectra with those stored in the Wiley 275.L mass spectral library of the GC/MS data system using computer.
