0: The composition of the volatile constituents of MEO was determined using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analyses, which was performed via a GC/MS-QP5050 equipped with a DB-5MS capillary column (40 m  1.8 mm (internal diameter)), film thickness: 0.18 m) and a QP5050 mass selective detector.
1: In order to detect GC/MS, an electron ionizations system with ionization energy of 70 eV was adopted.
2: Helium was the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.
3: Injector and detector line temperature were set at 260 C and 230 C, respectively.
4: Moreover, column temperature was initially kept at 60 C for 5 min, after which it was gradually increased to 260 C at a 5 C/min rate.
5: One L diluted samples were injected manually and the split ratio was equaled 1/40.
