0: The formulations were prepared using film hydration method as previously described ( 20).
1: A precise amount of 1200 mol of the nonionic surfactants (Span and Tween) and Chol in different molar ratios, 50:50, 60:40, and 70:30 were dissolved in chloroform in a round-bottom flask.
2: Afterwards, 2.5 mL of MEO solution 2% in chloroform was added to the lipid phase.
3: After removing the organic solvents at 50 C under vacuum in a rotary evaporator (EYELA SB-1200, Japan), the film was hydrated with 10 mL deionized water with a gentle rotation at 50 C for 60 min to produce an aqueous niosomal suspension containing 0.5% MEO.
