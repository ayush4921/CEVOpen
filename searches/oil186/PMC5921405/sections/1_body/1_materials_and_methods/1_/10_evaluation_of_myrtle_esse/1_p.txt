0: The  in vitro release study was performed for F6 formulation, using static vertical diffusion Franz cells with an effective diffusion area of 1.5 cm 2 and a receptor phase volume of 15 mL (Ashke-shisheh Co., Iran).
1: The PTFE filter membrane pore size 0.22 m was soaked in ethanol 50% for 24 h before the experiments.
2: The membrane was fixed between donor and receptor compartments.
3: The receptor compartment was filled with 50% ethanol 98 and 50% distilled water, then it was continuously stirred and thermostated at 37  1 C throughout the experiment.
4: The donor compartment was filled with 1 mL nMEO.
5: Total MEO solution and empty niosomal formulation were used as the control group.
6: One mL sample was withdrawn at fixed time intervals from receptor compartment and replaced with an equal volume of fresh acceptor phase to ensure sink conditions.
7: The permeated drug concentrations were measured by GC/MS analyses.
