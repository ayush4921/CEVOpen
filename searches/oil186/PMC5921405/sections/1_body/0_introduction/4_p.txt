0: In the current study, at first myrtle essential oil (MEO) was extracted and analyzed and then the niosomal myrtle essential oil (nMEO) were prepared and characterized in for their size, zeta potential, percentage of entrapment efficiency (EE%), and stability.
1: Finally, functionality of nMEO for microbial growth inhibition was measured against  Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Serratia marcescens, and  Bacillus subtilis.
2: These bacterial species are responsible for wound contamination, wound colonization, and clinical infections.
3: Also they may cause opportunistic skin infections in immune-suppressed patients.
4: Gram-positive coccid such as  S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and  M. luteus may origin from wound infections, impetigo, furuncles, abscesses, and carbuncles.
5: The Gram-negative bacilli including  E. coli and  S. marcescens are part of normal intestinal flora.
6: However, in some situation they may cause infection in complicating burn injuries and also surgical site ( 1617).
7: In this study, we hypothesized that nMEO is more efficient than MEO in drug releasing behavior.
