0: In terms of physical properties, EOs are volatile compounds which can easily evaporate and/or decompose even at room temperature due to very low boiling point and direct exposure to light or oxygen, respectively ( 6).
1: Furthermore, conventional formulations of EOs can oftentimes cause skin irritation and sensitization.
2: Several approaches including the application of vesicular systems such as niosomes ( 7) have been developed to resolve these problems.
3: Niosomes are non-ionic surfactants and have been used in drug ( 8) or gene delivery ( 9).
4: In drug delivery, niosomes are capable of increasing skin penetration and acting as a local depot to provide sustained release of topically applied drugs in the dermis.
5: Due to properties such as biodegradability, non-toxicity, non-immunogenicity, low cost, and superior chemical and storage stabilities, niosomes offer several advantages over other vesicular systems ( 1011).
6: EOs entrapment in the hydrophobic region of niosomes can improve their permeability and stability features, consequently reducing skin irritation properties of EOs ( 12).
7: Niosomal formulations can improve the stratum corneum functions by attenuating water loss from trans-epidermal skin and increasing skin smoothness by replacing its lost lipids.
8: Furthermore, the residence time of drug in the stratum corneum and epidermis increases and its systemic absorption decreases following application of niosomal systems ( 1314).
9: It was previously shown by Manosroi,  et al.
10: that niosomal encapsulation of  Mimusops elengi flower extract reduced extract cytotoxicity on human skin fibroblast and also enhanced its physical stability ( 15).
