0: For preparation of  P. roseum essential oil (EO), aerial parts of the plant were collected from a herb garden (Kashan, Iran) during 2014.
1: The identity of the plant was confirmed by professor Rahimian, Sari Agricultural and Natural Resources University (Sari, Iran).
2: By using a Clevenger type apparatus, the essential oil of the plant was obtained by hydrodistillation.
3: Gas chromatographic mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analysis was performed using a Shimadzu GC-9A with helium as the carrier gas on a DB-5 column (30 m  0.25 mm i.d; film thickness 0.25 mm).
4: GCMS analysis was carried out on a Varian 3400 GCMS system with oven temperature set at 40-250C at a rate of 4C; transfer line temperature, 260C; carrier gas, helium with a linear velocity of 31.5 cm/s; split ratio, 1/60; ionization energy, 70 eV; scan time, 1 s: mass range, 40-300 amu.
