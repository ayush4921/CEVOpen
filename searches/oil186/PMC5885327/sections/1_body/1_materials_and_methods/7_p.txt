0: For the  in vitro assay, we used the method described by Munoz et al., 1998 after making slight modifications.
1: To examine the susceptibilities of  T. gallinae toward  P. roseum EO and MTZ, sterile multi-well plates were used to incubate the trophozoites with different concentrations of the essential oil and drug dilutions.
2: A volume of 100 L of culture medium containing 1 10 4 parasites was pipetted into each well.
3: Also, prediluted MTZ and  P. roseum EO were added to wells to give final concentrations of 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 g/mL.
4: Tween 20 (0.01% of final concentration) was used as a solubilizing agent for  in vitro analysis.
5: Control wells received only Tween 20 without any treatments.
6: Subsequently, to generate anaerobic conditions, a layer of 50 L of vaseline was added to wells based on the method developed by Munoz et al., 1998.
7: All assays were done three times.
8: The wells were examined using an inverted microscope every 24 hr for 3 successive days.
9: The MIC was the lowest concentration of the drug in the well at which no motile parasite was observed.
