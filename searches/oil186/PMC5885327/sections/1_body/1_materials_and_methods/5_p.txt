0: T. gallinae were recovered by wet mount method from infected native pigeons.
1: Forty native pigeons (6 to 8 weeks old) were purchased from local breeders in Babol city (Mazandaran Province, Iran).
2: By using swabs moistened with saline solution, samples were taken from membranous lesions of oropharyngeal region of suspicious birds.
3: To produce wet smears, swabs were rubbed over the surface of a microscope slide.
4: Smears were then examined under a light microscope at X100 and X400 magnification to confirm  T. gallinae as the causative agent of lesions.
5: Parasite culture was prepared by immersing oral swabs in tryptone/ yeast extract/ maltose (TYM) medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma, Germany) and incubated at 37C (Sansano-Maestre et al., 2009  ).
6: Cultures were observed over five consecutive days to check the growth of  T. gallinae.
7: Every 48 hr as the parasites in the logarithmic phase of growth presented more than 95% mobility and normal morphology, isolates were sub-cultured (Seddiek et al., 2014  ).
