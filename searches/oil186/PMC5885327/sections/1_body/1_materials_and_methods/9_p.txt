2: Seven days post-infection, birds were examined and those that were diagnosed as infected with  T. gallinae, were randomly allocated into 5 groups as follows: the first group (CON) were infected but not medicated, EO 25 and EO 50 were the groups infected with  T. gallinae and medicated with 25 and 50 mg/kg of  P. roseum essential oil, respectively.
3: MTZ 25 and MTZ 50 groups were infected with  T. gallinae and medicated with 25 and 50 mg/kg of metronidazole, respectively.
4: All of the treatments were administered orally (PO) for 7 successive days.
5: Birds of different groups were located in separate wire cages and fed with semisolid mixed grains diet in order to prevent starvation due to difficulty in swallowing because of trichomoniasis.
6: The numbers of motile trophozoites recovered from the infected birds, were determined every day for seven consecutive days.
