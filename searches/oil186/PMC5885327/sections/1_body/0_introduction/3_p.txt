0: Trichomonas gallinae, which is considered the cause of avian trichomoniasis is a flagellate located in the upper digestive and occasionally in the respiratory tracts of a large variety of birds, mainly in the orders Columbiformes and Falconiformes (Boal et al., 1998  ; Rouffaer et al., 2014  ).
1: Birds with avian trichomoniasis present caseous lesions within the anterior digestive tract.
2: The lesions range from mild, often subclinical infections, to sever inflammation which can be acute and fatal, and lead to death by starvation due to the obstruction of the lumen of the esophagus (Gerhold et al., 2008  ).
3: T. gallinae has significant health and economic impacts on the poultry industry especially pigeons and game birds rearing and breeding (Stockdale et al., 2015  ) and is considered a major contributing factor to the regulation and even decline of avian populations.
4: The drugs of choice for the treatment of trichomoniasis are nitroimidazoles.
5: Subtherapeutic doses and preventive use of these drugs against trichomoniasis, have resulted in emergence of resistant strains of  T. gallinae (Lumeij and Zwijnenberg, 1990  ).
