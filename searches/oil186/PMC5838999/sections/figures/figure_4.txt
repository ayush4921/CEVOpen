0:  a: Residual pancreatic lipase activity at various concentrations of RaEO.
1: Lipase activity was measured using olive oil as substrate, in the presence of 4 mM of NaDC.
2: Results are expressed as means  S.D., n = 3. b: Kinetic experiment of hydrolysis of olive oil emulsion by TPL.
3: The kinetic curve was recorded continuously during the automated titration of liberated fatty acids under standard conditions using pH-stat apparatus.
4: The arrows indicate the successive injections into the reaction medium of olive oil emulsion (OOE), (NaDC + colipase), TPL and RaEO )  )  Fig.
