0: This method was performed to observe the behavior of the lipase (inactivation or not) at the lipid/water interface during the hydrolysis of the water-insoluble substrate.
1: The hydrolysis rate of olive oil emulsion was measured at pH 8.5 with TPL in the presence of colipase and NaDC.
2: The essential oil was then added during substrate hydrolysis and the residual activity was measured.
3: As depicted by Fig.
4: 4b, the rate of olive oil hydrolysis by TPL decreased rapidly.
5: The addition of an excess of substrate (olive oil emulsion) at the end of the kinetic does not succeed in restoring the initial velocity of the enzyme, showing that the lipase inhibition was irreversible.
