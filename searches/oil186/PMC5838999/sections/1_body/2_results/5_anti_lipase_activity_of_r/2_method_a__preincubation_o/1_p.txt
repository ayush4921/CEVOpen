0: The aim of this method was to test, in an aqueous medium and in the absence of the substrate, the possible reactions between the pancreatic lipase and the inhibitor.
1: The residual lipase activity was investigated at different concentrations of essential oil (0.05 to 2.00 mg/mL) (Fig.
2: 4a).
3: As shown by the figure, a doseresponse curve was obtained, with maximum inhibition (80%) achieved at 2.00 mg/mL of essential oil.
4: The inhibitory activity of the essential oil expressed as IC 50 value was about 0.22  0.002 mg/mL, which is lower than that of pure THL (0.16  0.001) used as a standard inhibitor against pancreatic lipase.
