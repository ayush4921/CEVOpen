0: Therefore, the goal of this study was to establish the chemical composition, the antioxidant effects of the essential oil of  R. acaule collected in a very different habitat of Tunisia and its inhibitory power against -glucosidase, xanthine oxidase and pancreatic lipase.
1: Enzyme kinetic studies using Michaelis-Menten and the derived Lineweaver-Burk (LB) plots were performed to understand the possible mechanism of inhibition exercised by the components of this essential oil.
