0: The means and standard deviation (SD) of data were calculated from independent experiments.
1: The IC 50 (-glucosidase, xanthine oxidase and pancreatic lipase inhibition) and EC 50 (ABTS, reducing power and phosphomolybdenum methods) values were calculated by linear regression analysis and the limits of their confidence intervals were carried out under the normality assumption.
2: Data analysis was carried out using an unpaired Students  t-test.
3: GraphPad Software (USA) was used to fit sigmoid curves models and data were analyzed using a statistical analysis computer software (Graphpad Instat v.3.0a for MacIntosh, San Diego, CA, USA).
