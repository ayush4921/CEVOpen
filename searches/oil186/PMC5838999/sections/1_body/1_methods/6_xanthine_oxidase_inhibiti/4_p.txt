0: For the kinetics study, the reaction mixture was as described above, except that the substrate concentration increased from 37.5 to 300 M, and in the presence of different concentrations of RaEO (2.5, 3.75 and 5 g/mL).
1: The reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme, and monitored at 295 nm and at 5 min intervals during 30 min.
2: The obtained results were used to construct LineweaverBurk plots to determine the inhibition mode, Michaelis-Menten constant (K m) and maximum velocity (V max) values.
3: The inhibition constant (Ki) value was calculated from the secondary plot constructed using Y-intercepts of LineweaverBurk plots.
4: (Ki) expresses the equilibrium constant for the binding of RaEO to xanthine oxidase.
