0: Xanthine oxidase activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 295 nm by continuously measuring uric acid formation, according to the protocol of Kong et al.
1: [ 28].
2: The reaction mixture is composed of 250 L of test solution, 300 L of 70 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and 300 L of substrate solution (150 M xanthine in the same buffer).
3: After preincubation at 25 C during 15 min, the reaction was triggered by the addition of 150 L enzyme solution (0.1 units/mL in 70 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) freshly prepared before use.
4: Pure control having 100% enzyme activity was conducted by replacing the essential oil with DMSO.
5: Blank for pure control having 0% enzyme activity was conducted with DMSO and by replacing the enzyme with buffer.
6: Allopurinol was used as a positive control.
7: The RaEO was tested for xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity at various concentrations.
8: Each sample was carried out in triplicate.
9: The inhibitory activity was determined by IC 50, which was obtained from percent inhibition calculated by the following equation:
