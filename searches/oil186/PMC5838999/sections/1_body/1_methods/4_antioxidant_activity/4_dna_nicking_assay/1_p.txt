0: In this test, the DNA was treated according to the method of Lee et al.
1: [ 25].
2: A volume of 5 l of essential oil at the concentration of 2 mg/mL was added to 2 l of pGEM-Tplasmid DNA (0.5 g/well).
3: The mixtures were then kept for 10 min at room temperature followed by the addition of 10 l of Fentons reagent (3 mM H2O2, 50 M L-ascorbic acid and 80 M FeCl3).
4: The obtained mixtures were then incubated at 37 C during 5 min.
5: Finally, the DNA incubated with or without essential oil was then analyzed on 1% ( w/ v) agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized under ultraviolet light.
