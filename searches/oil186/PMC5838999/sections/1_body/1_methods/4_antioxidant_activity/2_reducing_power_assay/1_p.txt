0: The RaEO reducing power was evaluated using the method described by Oyaizu [ 23].
1: The essential oil concentrations ranged from 0.3 to 10 mg/mL.
2: Aliquot of 1 mL essential oil dissolved in methanol was mixed with 1 mL of 200 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.6) and 1 mL (1%) of potassium ferricyanide [K 3Fe(CN) 6].
3: The obtained mixture was incubated at 50 C for 20 min, and then acidified with 1 mL of trichloroacetic acid (10%).
4: At the last step, 0.25 mL of FeCl 3 (0.1%) were added to this solution.
5: Distilled water was used as blank and for control.
6: Using UV spectrophotometer, absorption of this mixture was measured at 700 nm.
7: Increased absorbance of the mixture designates the sample ferric reducing power capability.
8: The essential oil providing 0.5 of absorbance (EC 50) was calculated using the absorbance graph of at 700 nm against essential oil concentration.
9: Trolox was used as a positive control.
10: The obtained values are presented as the means of triplicate assay.
