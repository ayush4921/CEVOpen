0: The antiradical activity was performed by the ABTS .+ free radical decolorization assay as developed by Re et al.
1: [ 22] with minor modifications.
2: The 2,2-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) was prepared as aqueous stock solution (7 mM).
3: The ABTS radical cations (ABTS .+ ) were produced by the reaction of the ABTS stock solution with 2.45 mM of K 2S 2O 8.
4: The mixture of assay was incubated for 15 h in the dark at room temperature.
