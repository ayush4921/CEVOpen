0: Furthermore, to obtain 0.7  0.02 units at 734 nm as absorption, the solution was diluted with ethanol.
1: Samples were separately dissolved in ethanol to yield the following concentrations: (0.312, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, and 5 mg/mL).
2: In order to measure the essential oil antioxidant activity, 10 L were added to 990 L of diluted ABTS +at various concentrations.
3: The absorption was read after 20 min of incubation.
4: The antioxidant power of each sample was expressed as the inhibition percentage (I %) calculated according to the following formula: \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$ \mathrm{I}\%=\left(\left({\mathrm{A}}_{\mathrm{blank}}\hbox{--} {\mathrm{A}}_{\mathrm{sample}}\right)/{\mathrm{A}}_{\mathrm{blank}}\right)\times 100 $$\end{document}I%=AblankAsample/Ablank100
