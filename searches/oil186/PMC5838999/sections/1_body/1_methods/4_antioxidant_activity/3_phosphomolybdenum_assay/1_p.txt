0: Essential oil samples (200 L) were mixed with 2 mL of the phosphomolybdenum reagent (600 mM sulfuric acid, 28 mM sodium phosphate, 4 mM ammonium molybdate) [ 24].
1: Then, the mixture was incubated at 95 C during 90 min and cooled to room temperature.
2: Subsequently the absorbance was measured at 695 nm.
3: In order to estimate the percentage of molybdenum reduced by tested essential oil, a standard curve was constructed using ascorbic acid.
4: EC 50 (mg/mL) corresponds to the effective concentration at which the total antioxidant activity (TAA) was 50% and was obtained by interpolation from linear regression analysis.
5: As a positive control, the ascorbic acid was used.
6: The values are presented as the means of triplicate assay.
