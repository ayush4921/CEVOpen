0: A spectrophotometric -glucosidase assay was performed as previously described by Tao et al.
1: [ 26] with slight modifications as detailed by Rengasamy et al.
2: [ 27].
3: The mixture of -glucosidase reaction contained 2.5 mM  p-nitrophenyl--D-glucopyranoside (pNPG), 250 L of essential oil in DMSO and 0.3 U/mL of -glucosidase in phosphate buffer, pH 6.9.
4: Pure control having 100% enzyme activity was conducted by replacing the essential oil with DMSO.
5: Blank for pure control having 0% enzyme activity was conducted with DMSO and by replacing the enzyme with buffer.
6: In positive controls, acarbose, which is clinically used as an -glucosidase inhibitor, replaced the essential oil.
7: Absorbance of the released  p-nitrophenol (pNP) was measured (405 nm) and was considered proportional to the activity of the enzyme.
8: Each sample was carried out in triplicate.
9: Inhibition percentage by essential oil and acarbose were calculated using the following equation: \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$ \mathrm{Inhibition}\ \mathrm{percentage}\ \left(\%\right)=\left(1-\left({\Delta \mathrm{OD}}_{\mathrm{sample}}/{\Delta \mathrm{OD}}_{\mathrm{control}}\right)\right)\times 100.
10: $$\end{document}Inhibition percentage%=1ODsample/ODcontrol100.
