0: Analytical GCMS: GC/EIMS analyses were carried out with a Varian CP-3800 gas-chromatograph equipped with a HP-5 capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm; coating thickness 0.25 m) and a Varian Saturn 2000 ion trap mass detector.
1: The analytical conditions were: injector and transfer line temperatures 220 and 240 C respectively; oven temperature programmed from 60 C to 240 C at 3 C/min; carrier gas helium at 1 mL/min; injection of 0.2 L (10% hexane solution); split ratio 1:30.
2: Identification of the compounds was based on comparison of the retention times with those of authentic samples, comparing their linear retention indices relative to the series of  n-hydrocarbons, and on computer matching against commercial (NIST 2014 and ADAMS) and home-made library mass spectra built up from pure substances and components of known essential oils and MS literature data [ 18 21].
