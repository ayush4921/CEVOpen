0: In this assay, RaEO was dissolved in DMSO and was used to evaluate its inhibitory effect on lipase.
1: To evaluate the pancreatic lipase inhibitory activity, TPL was preincubated at room temperature for 1 h with various RaEO concentrations.
2: The reaction medium contained 20 L of RaEO and 60 L of enzyme.
3: After preincubation, 40 L from the reaction mixture were used to evaluate the residual pancreatic lipase activity, as previously indicated.
4: Pure control having 100% enzyme activity was conducted by replacing the essential oil with DMSO.
5: Blank for pure control having 0% enzyme activity was conducted with DMSO and by replacing the enzyme with buffer.
6: On the other hand, THL was used as a positive control for this test.
7: The lipase inhibition (% inhibition) was calculated in comparison with the initial activity, measured in the absence of inhibitors.
8: The IC 50 values were calculated from plots of log concentration of essential oil versus percentage inhibition curves using Sigma Plot 12.1 (IL, USA).
