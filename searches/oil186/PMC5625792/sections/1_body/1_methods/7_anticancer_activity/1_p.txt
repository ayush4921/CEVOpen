0: Cell viability of MCF-7 (human breast adenocarcinoma) and Hela (human cervical carcinoma) cell lines was assessed using the MTT assay as previously described by Mosmann [ 35].
1: This assay is based on the reduction of MTT into purple formazan crystals by the succinate dehydrogenase enzyme in the mitochondrial respiratory chain.
2: Cells were harvested by trypsinization, seeded in 96 well-plates at 80000 cells per ml of medium and allowed to attach for 24 h. After, 100 l of ROEO, first dissolved in DMSO and then in DMEM medium, were added to obtain final concentrations ranging from 0.004 to 1.1 l ml 1 in wells.
3: Control cells were supplemented with 100 l medium with DMSO.
4: MCF-7 cells were exposed to the treatment for 48 h. After treatment, the medium was removed and replaced with 100 l of fresh medium supplemented with 10 l of MTT solution (5 mg ml 1 in PBS).
5: After 4 h, 100 l of 10% SDS solution were added to each well.
6: Subsequent to formazan dissolution, the optical density was evaluated at 570 nm using a multidetection microplate reader.
7: The growth inhibition was expressed as follows:
