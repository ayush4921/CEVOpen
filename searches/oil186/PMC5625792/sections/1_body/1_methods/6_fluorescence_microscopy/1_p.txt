0: Biofilm visualization was performed using fluorescence microscopy.
1: Biofilms were grown on glass coverslips for 48 h. After, the medium was discarded and coverslips were washed with physiologic water to remove the non-adherent bacteria.
2: Then, TSB medium containing 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20 was added in control wells and TSB (with 0.5% Tween 20) added with adequate volume of ROEO to assess the anti-biofilm activity of the oil.
3: After 24 h, wells contained coverslips were emptied and washed twice with physiologic water.
4: Acridine orange (0.1%, w/v, dissolved in PBS 1X) was used to stain biofilms formed in coverslips.
5: Biofilms were observed under an OLYMPUS fluorescent microscope BX50 equipped with a digital camera OLYMPUS DP70 using U-MWB2 filter with excitation at 460490 nm and emission at 520 nm.
