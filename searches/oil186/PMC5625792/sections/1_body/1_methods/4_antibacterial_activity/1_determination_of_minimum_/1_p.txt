0: The antibacterial activities of ROEO were investigated using micro-dilution method in 96-well plates as suggested by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards [ 30].
1: The test was carried out with two bacterial species  Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 9144 and  Staphylococcus epidermidis S61.
2: Each bacterium was grown in LB medium overnight at 30 C. The culture was then adjusted to an optical density of 0.6 at a wavelength of 600 nm.
3: The essential oil was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to adequate concentrations and then filtered.
4: A volume of 100 l was added in each well of two columns of the plate with medium and successive two-fold dilution was prepared in plate to obtain final essential oil concentration of 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.61, 0.31, 0.15, 0.07 l ml 1.
5: An aliquot (20 l) of the bacterial dilution was added to each well and a final volume of 200 l/well was adjusted with medium.
6: Wells containing only LB medium with inoculum and these containing medium, inoculum and Ampicillin served as controls.
7: Microplates were incubated at 30 C for 1824 h. After incubation, bacterial growth was evaluated by the MTT revelation.
8: 20 l of 3- (4, 5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)- 2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) at concentration of 1 mg ml 1 was prepared in water, filtered and added to each well.
9: The plates were incubated for 20 min in the dark with stirring.
10: The viable bacteria were detected by the change of yellow MTT color to purple.
11: The MIC was defined as the lowest EO concentration that completely inhibited any visual growth of the microorganisms being tested.
12: So, the MIC interval was taken from the first well devoid of bacterial growth and the first well showing growth.
