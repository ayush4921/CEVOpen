0: For staining step, a volume of 100 l of resazurin (7-hydroxy-3H-phenoxazine-3-one-10-oxide) (AppliChem GmBH, Germany) at a concentration of 10 g ml 1 was added to each well.
1: The plate was incubated in darkness and room temperature for 30 min.
2: The fluorescence of the resorufin was then measured at a wavelength of 590 nm with an excitation at 550 of nm using a microplate reader (Varioscan Flash, Thermo Scientific).
