0: The bacterial viability within the biofilm was quantified using the resazurin test.
1: Resazurin is a blue fluorescent dye that is reduced by viable bacteria to fluorescent pink resorufin [ 34].
2: After biofilm formation for 48 h at 30 C, planktonic bacteria were removed and the wells were washed twice with PBS.
3: 200 l of ROEO diluted in TSB medium with 0.5% Tween 20 (v/v), at different concentrations 1.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 l ml 1 were added.
4: TSB medium with 0.5% Tween 20 was used as control.
5: After incubation during 24 h at 30 C, TSB medium and non-adherent bacteria were removed followed by double washing with PBS.
