0: Anti-biofilm activity was assessed in 96-well flat bottom plates using a method adapted by Nostro et al.
1: [ 31] with some modifications.
2: Staphylococcus epidermidis S61, a biofilm-forming strain in our Lab collection [ 32], was grown overnight in TSB (Tryptic Soy Broth) medium at 30 C and diluted with fresh medium supplemented with 2.25% glucose.
3: An aliquot of 100 l of culture dilution was dispensed into each well to obtain a final OD 600 nm of 0.1.
4: After, 100 l of ROEO dissolved in TSB, containing 0.5% (v/v) of Tween 20, at different concentrations, were added into wells to reach final concentrations of 1.25, 2.5, 12.5 and 25 l ml 1. wells containing TSB medium supplemented with 0.5% (v/v) of Tween 20 and inoculum without essential oil were served as controls.
5: Plates were incubated for 24 h at 30 C. After incubation, wells were emptied by tapping the plates into a disposal vessel.
6: Planktonic cells were gently removed by washing each well twice with 200 l of sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2).
7: After washing, plates were dried at 60 C for 1 h. Each well was stained with 150 l of crystal violet solution prepared in 20% ethanol (v/v) for 15 min at room temperature.
8: After incubation, the excess of crystal violet was eliminated and wells were rinsed three times with sterile water.
9: Finally, 200 l of glacial acetic acid (33% (v/v)) were added to each well and plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature.
10: All tests were performed in triplicate.
11: Finally, the optical density (OD) of each well was measured using the microplate reader at a wavelength of 570 nm.
12: In order to determine the ability of ROEO to prevent bacterial adherence and biofilm formation, the percentage of adherence inhibition was calculated using the following formula: \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$ {\left[\left(\mathrm{OD}\ \left(\mathrm{growth}\ \mathrm{control}\right)\hbox{--} \mathrm{OD}\ \left(\mathrm{sample}\right)\right)/\mathrm{OD}\ \left(\mathrm{growth}\ \mathrm{control}\right)\right]}^{\ast }100 $$\end{document}ODgrowth controlODsample/ODgrowth control100
