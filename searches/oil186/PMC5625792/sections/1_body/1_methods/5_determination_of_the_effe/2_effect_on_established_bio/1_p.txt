0: The effect of ROEO on established biofilm was studied using the method previously described by Kavanaugh and Ribbeck [ 33] with slight modification.
1: After biofilm formation for 48 h, the medium and non-attached bacteria were removed by aspiration using a micropipette followed by a twice washing with PBS.
2: 200 l of ROEO, diluted in medium and supplemented with 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20, were placed into each well to yield final concentrations of 1.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 l ml 1.
3: Plates were further incubated at 30 C for 24 h. After incubation, biofilms were stained with crystal violet as described previously.
4: Each experiment was evaluated in triplicate.
5: The control was a biofilm without essential oil.
6: By comparing the OD values (570 nm) of the growth control with that of the essential oil, we calculated the percentage of biofilm eradication using the equation: \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$ {\left[\left(\mathrm{OD}\ \left(\mathrm{growth}\ \mathrm{control}\right)\hbox{--} \mathrm{OD}\ \left(\mathrm{sample}\right)\right)/\mathrm{OD}\ \left(\mathrm{growth}\ \mathrm{control}\right)\right]}^{\ast }100 $$\end{document}ODgrowth controlODsample/ODgrowth control100
