0: The cell migration assay was performed based on the protocol described by Dahham et al.
1: [ 36] with slight modification.
2: Briefly, MCF-7 and Hela cells were grown in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS until 80% of confluence at 37 C and 5% CO 2 in 60 mm tissue culture dish.
3: Thereafter, two parallel wounds per dish were performed with a sterilized plastic tip and cells were washed twice with PBS 1X to remove cells in suspension.
4: Upon adding medium, the treatment with adequate concentration of ROEO was added and incubated with an untreated sample as a control.
5: Pictures of fixed positions in the wounds were taken with a Canon digital camera that was mounted on the inverted microscope (Leica DM IL) to follow the repopulation of the wound.
