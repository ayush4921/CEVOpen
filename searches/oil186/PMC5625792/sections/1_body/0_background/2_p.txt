0: Bacteria, during development, can be present in planktonic or sessile forms known as biofilm [ 13].
1: Biofilm is a microbial structure that causes many problems in medical field, in food industry and even to the environment.
2: Thus, biofilm could cause many public health problems.
3: Indeed, nearly 80% of chronic bacterial infections are associated with the presence of biofilm [ 14].
4: In addition, biofilms contaminate the majority of medical or prosthetic devices such as vascular prosthesis [ 15], urinary catheters [ 16], joint prostheses, pacemakers [ 17], contact lens [ 18] and dental plates [ 19].
5: As the antibiotic treatment is most effective against microbial infections, bacterial biofilms are highly resistant to antibiotics posing a public health problem.
6: Indeed, concentrations of antibiotics needed to inhibit bacteria in biofilms may be greater than a thousand times that required to inhibit the same planktonic bacteria [ 20].
7: So, it is necessary to find alternatives to fight against biofilm problems.
8: In addition, biofilms cause a problem in many food industries.
9: They contaminate the surfaces in contact with food while causing an alteration of the organoleptic quality of food products [ 21].
10: It has been previously demonstrated that essential oils are able to penetrate and cause the destruction of microbial biofilms [ 22].
11: Few studies have shown the anti-biofilm activity of ROEO [ 23,  24].
12: However, all of these studies did not use  Staphylococcus epidermidis, which is the major cause of catheter infections, as a model for anti-biofilm studies.
