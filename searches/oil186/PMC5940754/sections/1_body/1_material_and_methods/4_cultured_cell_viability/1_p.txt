0: To analyze the effect of the essential oil of  S.  guianensis on the viability of lepidopteran cells, cultured cells from  S.  frugiperda [IPLB-SF-21AE; 28] and from  A.  gemmatalis [UFL-AG-286; 29] supplemented with 10% bovine fetal serum (Gibco-BRL) were maintained at 27 C in TC-100 medium (Vitrocell; Campinas, SP, Brazil).
1: In 96-well microplates, 10 4 cells/well were incubated for a 24 h period with serial dilutions of  S.  guianensis essential oil at the concentrations of 0, 0.4, 0.04, 0.004, and 0.0004 L /mL.
2: Negative controls without the addition of the essential oil were also incubated for each cell line.
3: All assays were carried out in triplicates.
4: Cell viability was determined by the trypan blue exclusion method in the Countess Automated Cell Counter (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA, USA), using the manufacturer specified protocol.
5: The same experiment was performed with a human monocytic cell line (TPH1) after incubation with increasing concentrations of the  S.  guianensis essential oil (0.85; 1.30; 1.70 and 2.12 L/mL).
