0: Finally, to investigate the potential cytopathic effects of  S.  guianensis essential oil on cultured lepidopteran cells, IPLB-SF-21AE and UFL-AG-286 cells were incubated with the essential oil at a concentration of 0.86 mg/mL.
1: The culture medium was removed after the incubation period (i.e., 24 h) and the cells were immediately treated with reagents provided in the Apoptosis/Necrosis Detection Kit (blue, green, red) (Abcam; Cambridge, UK), following the manufacturers instructions.
2: The assayed cells were analyzed using a fluorescence microscope (Axiovert 100; Zeiss GmBh, Oberkochen, Germany).
