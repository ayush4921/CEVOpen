0: Concentration-mortality bioassays were carried out using 3 rd instar larvae in a completely randomized experimental design.
1: We used impregnated filter paper (9 cm in diameter) as the surface for the essential oil (contact) exposure.
2: The essential oil of  S.  guianensis was dissolved in a mixture of water and 2% (v/v) of the detergent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to obtain the desired concentrations.
3: Filter paper disks were impregnated with 300 L of this solution and placed covering the inner walls of a 100 mL plastic cup, which received 25 larvae of the velvetbean caterpillar or a single larva of the armyworm (to avoid cannibalism).
4: Each bioassay was replicated four times, and each replicate contained 25 velvetbean caterpillars or 16 armyworms.
5: Larval mortality was recorded after 24 h of exposure, considering dead the larvae that were unable to walk when prodded with a fine hair brush.
6: A similar procedure was used to establish the concentration-response curves for the synthetic insecticides indoxacarb (Rumo 300 g a.i./L; DuPont do Brasil S.A., Barueri, SP, Brazil) against the 3 rd instar larvae of all strains.
7: The conventional insecticide was used as positive control for the assessed insecticidal activity of the essential oil of  S.  guianensis.
