0: The results of egg viability, oviposition, foliar consumption and larval weight were subjected to univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA), or Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA on ranks when the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity were not satisfied.
1: The results of walking behavior were submitted to multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to secure an overall error level of  P < 0.05 with subsequent (univariate) analyses of variance of each trait, when appropriate (PROC GLM; 36).
2: The results of group activity were subjected to repeated measure analyses of variance to determine the effects of essential oil concentrations.
3: Differences were recognized by Fishers exact test (PROC ANOVA; 36).
