0: Concentrationmortality curves were estimated using probit analysis with the PROBIT procedure in the SAS statistical software package 36.
1: The differential (essential oil and indoxacarb) susceptibility between lepidopteran species was estimated for each compound based on the estimated LC 50 (i.e., the lethal concentration capable of killing 50% of tested lepidopterans) for each compound and lepidopteran species, and the tolerance ratios (TR 50) were estimated by dividing the LC 50 value obtained for  A.  gemmatalis by the LC 50 value obtained for  S.  frugiperda strains 37.
2: The 95% confidence limits of these toxicity rate estimates were considered to be significantly different ( P < 0.05) if they did not include the value 1 37.
