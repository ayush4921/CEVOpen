0: Two behavioral bioassays were carried out in arenas that were either fully treated or half-treated with essential oils.
1: The third instar larvae of each studied population were exposed by contact to filter paper impregnated with the  S.  guianensis essential oil at a concentration equivalent to the LC 50 for 3 h and subsequently submitted to individual walking bioassays.
2: The 3 rd instar was chosen due to its greater walking activity compared to the other instars.
3: No mortality was observed during the 3 h oil exposure period.
4: In the bioassays with fully treated arenas, the procedure was similar to the one described for the group locomotory bioassay except that the walking activity was recorded for 30 min.
5: The parameters recorded included the walked distance (cm), velocity (cm/s), resting time (s) and number of stops in the arena.
6: Twenty larvae were used for each population.
7: In each trial or replicate, the Petri dish and the filter paper were replaced.
8: In the bioassays with half-treated arenas, the amount of time spent on the oil-treated and on the untreated zones were recorded and used to calculate the proportions of time spent on each side of the arena.
9: Forty larvae were used for each population and essential oil treatment.
10: In each trial or replicate, the Petri dish and the filter paper were replaced.
