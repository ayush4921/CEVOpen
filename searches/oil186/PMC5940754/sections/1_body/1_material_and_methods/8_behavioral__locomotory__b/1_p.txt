0: The locomotory bioassays followed previously described methodologies with slight modifications 33  35.
1: Briefly, the larvae locomotory bioassays of both species ( S.  frugiperda and  A.  gemmatalis) were performed 3, 6, and 16 h after contact exposure to the respective LC 10 and LC 50 values of the  S.  guianensis essential oil determined for each Lepidoptera pest species ( S.  frugiperda: 3.34 (LC 10) and 8.09 (LC 50) L/mL;  A.  gemmatalis: 0.32 (LC 10) and 2.45 (LC 50) L/mL).
2: The contact exposure was performed using filter paper impregnated with 1 mL of the oil solution (or control) and left to dry at air temperature.
3: The exposed larvae were placed (either individually or in group) in an arena consisting of an uncontaminated filter paper placed in a Petri dish (135  20 mm); the movement of the larvae within the arena was recorded for 10 min using an automated video tracking system equipped with a CCD camera (ViewPoint Life Sciences, Montreal, Canada).
