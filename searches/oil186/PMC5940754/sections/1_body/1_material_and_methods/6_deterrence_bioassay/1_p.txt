0: The oviposition deterrence sparked by the  S.  guianensis essential oil was analyzed following previously described method 32 with some modifications.
1: PVC oviposition containers of 20 cm (diameter) per 25 cm (height), internally covered with sulfite paper, were used.
2: Half of the internal area was covered by sulfite paper treated with 20 mL of the essential oil at a concentration equivalent to LC 10 and allowed to air dry.
3: The other half was treated with either DMSO 2% in distilled water or water only (as a control).
4: Fifty containers were used per treatment and species ( S.  frugiperda and  A.  gemmatalis).
5: Each container received a couple of adult moths (i.e., 1  and 1 ), and the number of eggs laid in each area was recorded after 48 h.
