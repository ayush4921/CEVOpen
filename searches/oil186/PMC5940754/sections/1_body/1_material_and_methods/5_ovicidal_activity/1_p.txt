0: The ovicidal activity assay was carried out according to the methods described in 30,  31, with the following modifications.
1: The effect of the  S.  guianensis essential oil on the egg viability of  A.  gemmatalis and  S.  frugiperda was evaluated by immersing groups of 10 eggs for 30 seconds into a solution of the oil mixed with DMSO at 2% (v/v) in distilled water.
2: The oil concentration used was equivalent to LC 10 (i.e.,  S.  frugiperda: LC 10 = 3.34 L/mL and  A.  gemmatalis: LC 10 = 0.32 L/mL).
3: DMSO at 2% (v/v) in distilled water served as the control.
4: A completely randomized experimental design was used with four replicates for  S.  frugiperda and ten replicates for  A.  gemmatalis.
5: Egg viability (%) was recorded by counting the larva emergence after 72 h of exposure.
