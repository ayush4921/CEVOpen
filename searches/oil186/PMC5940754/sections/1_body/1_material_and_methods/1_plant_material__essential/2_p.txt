0: The GC-MS analysis was performed on a Shimadzu QP-2010 instrument (Kyoto, Japan) operating at 70 eV with a DB-5MS methylpolysiloxane column (30 m  0.25 mm  1.0 m; J & W Scientific Inc. Folsom.
1: USA).
2: The injection split ratio was 1:50 throughout the run (60.3 min) and helium was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.50 mL/min (53.5 Kpa).
3: The constant linear velocity was established at 42 cm/s and the injector temperature at 250 C. The temperature of the transfer line was 260 C.
