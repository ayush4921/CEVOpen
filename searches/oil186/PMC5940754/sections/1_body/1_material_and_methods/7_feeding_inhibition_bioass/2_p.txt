0: In the no-choice bioassay, either a treated or an untreated leaf section was offered to a single larva in a single plastic container.
1: The containers were kept closed with a plastic lid where small holes were made to allow gas exchange.
2: After 24 h of exposure, the changes in the leaf sections and the larvae weights were recorded.
3: The oil concentration equivalent to LC 10 was used and the control treatment consisted of water and DMSO.
4: The experimental design was completely randomized with 25 replicates per concentration; the experiment was replicated four times.
