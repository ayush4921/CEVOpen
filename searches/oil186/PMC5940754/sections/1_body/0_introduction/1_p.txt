0: The worldwide adoption of genetically modified crop plants expressing toxic proteins of the bacterium  Bacillus thuringiensis (i.e.,  Bt toxins) was a response to the economic losses caused by lepidopteran pest species, particularly in maize and soybeans 1.
1: However, despite the importance of genetically modified  Bt plants on the integrated management of lepidopteran and coleopteran pests 2  4, the sustainability of this agricultural practice has been threatened by lack of information about the interaction of  Bt toxins (e.g., Cry proteins) with non-target organisms (including other relevant pests such as the phytosuccivorous insect pests) and the rapid evolution of high levels of resistance.
2: Indeed, recent studies described field-evolved  Bt-resistance in the fall armyworm  Spodoptera frugiperda to non-pyramided  Bt plants expressing Cry1F, Cry1A.
3: 105, Cry2Ab and Cry1Ab toxins as well as to the dual-gene  Bt (i.e., expressing Cry1A.105 and Cry2Ab toxins) maize 5  10.
4: Additionally, cases of cross-resistance between  Bt toxins and non- Bt conventional insecticides were reported in the diamondback moth  Plutella xylostella (i.e., pyrethroids and Cry1Ac toxin) and in  S.  frugiperda (i.e., organophosphates and Cry1F toxin) 11  14.
