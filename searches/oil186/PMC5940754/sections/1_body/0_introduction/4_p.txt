0: Thus, the present study aimed at shedding further light on the insecticidal activity of the  S.  guianensis essential oil.
1: The chemical constituents of essential oils of  S.  guianensis were initially identified and subsequently tested on the velvetbean caterpillar  Anticarsia gemmatalis (Hubner), a key soybean pest species, and on  Bt-susceptible and resistant strains of the fall armyworm  Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E.
2: Smith), a key pest species of maize and soybeans.
3: The larvicidal, ovicidal, egg-laying deterrence and repellence properties of the  S.  guianensis essential oil were assessed, as was the potential impairment of larval walking activity of both caterpillar species.
4: We also assessed the toxicity of this essential oil on lepidopteran and human cell lines.
