0: The percentage composition of the essential oils was computed from the GC peak areas.
1: Most constituents were tentatively identified by comparison of their GC Kovats retention indices (RI), determined with reference to a homologous series of C5C28 n-alkanes and with those of authentic standards.
2: Further identification was made by matching with compounds in a NIST Mass Spectral Library.
