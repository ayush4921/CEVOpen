0: Exercise-induced fatigue is characterized by two signs: deterioration of performance is the primary sign, and tiredness/exhaustion is the secondary sign.
1: A mixture of four essential oils may be used to treat exercise-induced fatigue: two stimulant essential oils, one relaxing essential oil and a balancing essential oil.
2: Peppermint essential oil can increase alertness and mental clarity and decrease the perceived physical workload [ 23].
3: Rosemary essential oil inspires energy and stimulates vitality [ 5].
4: Orange essential oil is known for its calming and soothing properties that relax the muscles [ 12].
5: As a balancing essential oil, clove essential oil significantly increases the free radical scavenging capacity of the other oils, thus preventing oxidative injury during fatigue.
6: In addition, peppermint and orange essential oils evaporate more quickly than rosemary essential oil, and clove oil volatilizes the slowest, so appropriate proportions of each oil can create a lasting balance.
