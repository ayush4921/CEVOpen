0: Physical fatigue will occur sooner or later depending on the type of exercise.
1: Physical fatigue is commonly defined as the inability to sustain or maintain voluntary activity, and it is considered to be associated with a physiological decline [ 1].
2: Several theories have been proposed to explain physical fatigue, including the exhaustion theory, the radical theory, and the clogging theory.
3: The exhaustion theory proposed that depletion of energy stocks within the body, such as glucose or glycogen, could lead to fatigue.
4: However, the clogging theory, that is, the excessive accumulation of blood lactic acid (BLA) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), would cause metabolic disorders that would eventually result in the fatigue.
5: The radical theory hypothesizes that intensive exercise could produce an imbalance between the body's oxidation system and its antioxidation system.
6: Muscle cells have defense mechanisms that scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT and protect cells against exercise-induced oxidative injury [ 1 4].
7: Recovery from exercise-induced fatigue requires repairing the damage that has occurred in the body and eliminating the metabolic products that accumulated during exercise [ 3].
