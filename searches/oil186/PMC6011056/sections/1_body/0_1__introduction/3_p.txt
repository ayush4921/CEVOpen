0: Biofilms protect microorganisms from external aggression and predator attacks [ 17], and some populations of biofilm-associated bacteria are resistant to antibiotics [ 5].
1: Thus, the increased resistance of bacterial biofilms to antibiotics is problematic for the use of antimicrobial drugs [ 18], driving the search for alternative medicinal plants that can be used to treat diseases [ 19].
2: In particular, it is necessary to identify new drugs that can serve as an alternative treatment of infections caused by microorganisms that are resistant to traditional therapies.
3: One approach is the study of local medicinal plants with possible antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties.
