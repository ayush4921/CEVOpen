0: The bacteria used in this study were included  S. aureus ATCC6538,  S. epidermidis ATCC12228,  S. pyogenes ATCC19615,  P. aeruginosa ATCC15442, and  E. coli ATCC11303.
1: The strains were maintained in BHI (Brain Heart Infusion-Difco) + glycerol (20%) at -80C.
2: To perform the experiments, a 100  l aliquot was inoculated onto TSA medium ( Trypticase Soy Agar-Difco) and grown in a greenhouse at 37C for 24 h. After this initial growth, a 100  l inoculum was subcultured into 10 ml of TSB ( Trypticase Soy Broth- Difco) and grown for 18 h under the same conditions described above.
3: In the antimicrobial activity assays, the cultures were washed with Mili-Rios water and their concentrations were adjusted to 10 7-10 8 CFU/ml using a microplate reader (SpectraMax i3 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader) at 620 nm.
