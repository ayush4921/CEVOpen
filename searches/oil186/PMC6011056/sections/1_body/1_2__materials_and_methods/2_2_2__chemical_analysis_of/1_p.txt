0: The chemical compositions of the essential oils were analysed by gas chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer (GC-MS) using a Shimadzu QP2010 Plus chromatograph with helium (He) as the carrier gas and a FactorFour/VF-5 ms capillary column (30 m long, 0.25 mm internal diameter, and 0.25 mm film thickness).
1: The carrier gas was used at a flow rate of 1 ml/min.
2: The initial oven temperature was 60C, followed by constant heating for 2 min, and was increased 2C per minute to 110C, 3C per minute to 150C, and 15C per minute to 290C, with a final isotherm of 290C for 17 minutes.
3: The temperatures of the injector and detector were, respectively, set at 250C and 310C.
4: The injection mode was split and the injection volume used was 1  l. The mass spectra were produced by electron impact (70 eV).
