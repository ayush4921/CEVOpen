0: After the incubation period, the culture medium was removed and the plates were subjected to three washes with distilled water.
1: Next, 200  l of a 0.9% saline solution was aliquoted into the wells, and the plate was incubated in a sonic bath (LK-D32 Ultrasonic Bath) operating at 50 kHz for 10 min.
2: The liquid from the wells for each concentration teste was pooled to bring the volume to 1 ml, after which a 20  l aliquot was withdrawn and subjected to serial dilution in 180  l volumes of 0.85% saline solution (10 1 to 10 7).
3: In a Petri dish containing TSA, three 10  l aliquots were cultured for each concentration.
4: These plates were incubated for 24 h at 37C, after which the resulting colonies were counted [ 35].
