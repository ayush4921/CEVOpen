0: The plates were assembled in a process similar to the MIC test, and after 24 h the antibiofilm activity was assessed through the methods mentioned and described below.
1: After 24 h incubation, the plates were washed with sterile water (200  l/well) to remove the loosely adhered and air-dried cells.
2: The adhered cells of the biofilm were fixed in the plate wells by addition of 200  l of methanol for 15 min.
3: Afterwards, the methanol was removed and 200  l of a 1% violet crystal solution was added for 15 min.
4: Subsequently, the plates were washed and air dried again, after which 200  l of ethanol (96%) was added to each well which were left shaking for 5 min and then read on a microplate reader at 595 nm [ 35].
