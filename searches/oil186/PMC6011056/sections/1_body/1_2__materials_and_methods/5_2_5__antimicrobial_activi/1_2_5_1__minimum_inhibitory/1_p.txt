0: The antimicrobial activity of the  Cinnamomum stem essential oils against the five bacterial strains in their planktonic forms was tested by the microdilution method in polystyrene plates.
1: The minimum inhibitory concentration was determined by the microdilution technique in 96-well polystyrene plates.
2: For the assembly of the plates, 100  l of the essential oil solutions was serially diluted in culture medium, with the final concentrations varying from 2.00 to 0.01 mg/ml.
3: Next, 100  l of culture medium containing the microorganisms was added at the adjusted concentration of 10 7-10 8 CFU/ml as described above.
4: The negative control consisted of growing the microorganisms in TSB culture medium with 2% Tween 20.
5: The MIC was considered the lowest concentration of the substances at which no growth of the microorganisms was detected [ 34].
