0: Salicylic acid (SA) plays a crucial role in plant development, disease resistance, stress tolerance, and fruit yield (Horvath et al.,  2007; Rivas-San Vicente and Plasencia,  2011; Liu et al.,  2015).
1: Several investigations indicated that salicylic acid influences gas exchange parameters and water composition (Stevens et al.,  2006), increases phenolics accumulation (Kovacik et al.,  2009), enhances the oxidative stress tolerance (Li et al.,  2014), and may alleviate osmotic stress (Nazar et al.,  2011).
2: SA effects are largely dependent on genetic and environmental factors (Idrees et al.,  2010) as well as on method and dose of application (Horvath et al.,  2007).
3: Some investigations indicated that plant secondary metabolites might be influenced by SA treatments such as the essential oils in  Ocimum basilicum L. (Mirzajani et al.,  2015), oleoresins in  Pinus (Rodrigues and Fett-Neto,  2009), and triterpenes in  Nigella (Elyasi et al.,  2016).
