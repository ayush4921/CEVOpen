0: Salinity as abiotic stress is a permanent major threat to the agriculture industry worldwide and usually associated with morphological (e.g., reduced growth and productivity), physiological (e.g., reduction of gas exchange parameters and homeostasis), and biochemical (e.g., oxidative stress with elevated reactive oxygen species content) responses (Nazar et al.,  2011; Gupta and Huang,  2014; Khan et al.,  2014; Acosta-Motos et al.,  2017; Quan et al.,  2017).
1: The accumulation of Na + and Cl  during saline conditions is a detrimental factor that may lead to ion imbalance, ion toxicity, and physiological disorder (Gupta and Huang,  2014).
2: Several approaches had been adopted to control salinity adverse effects on plants including breeding programs and utilization of transgenic plants (Bhatnagar-Mathur et al.,  2008), chemical priming (Savvides et al.,  2016), microorganisms (Jha et al.,  2011), and salicylic acid (Fayez and Bazaid,  2014).
