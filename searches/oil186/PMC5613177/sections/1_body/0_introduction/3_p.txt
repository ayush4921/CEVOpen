0: Rosmarinus officinallis L. (Lamiaceae), commercially known as rosemary, is produced in the Mediterranean region such as in Egypt (Domokos et al.,  1997; Elansary and Mahmoud,  2015).
1: Rosemary leaves are consumed fresh or dried and might be used for essential oils production as well as for cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries (Elansary et al.,  2015; Habtemariam,  2016).
2: Previous investigations have shown that rosemary has antioxidant, antibacterial and anticancer activities (Bozin et al.,  2007; Elansary and Mahmoud,  2015).
3: However, there is insufficient information on rosemary bioactivity and its anti-oxidative mechanisms during salt stress and SA treatments.
4: Therefore, the main objective of this study was to investigate the effect of exogenous SA treatment on rosemary performance under saline conditions.
5: Several important traits of rosemary such as morphological (e.g., plant heights, branches number, and fresh and dry weights), physiological (essential oil ratio and constitutes, phenolics, carbohydrates, chlorophyll, proline, and Na + and Cl  of leaves), biochemical (antioxidant mechanisms) and genetic (expression of antioxidants genes and genes conferring tolerance to salinity) markers have been investigated in this study.
6: Furthermore, the inhibitory activities against wide spectrum bacteria were investigated as an economic application.
