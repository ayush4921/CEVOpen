0: To explore the antibacterial activities of SA treated compared to control plants under saline conditions, Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial were screened against essential oils of different treatments (season 2016).
1: Listeria monocytogenes (clinical isolate),  Bacillus cereus (ATCC 14579),  Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538),  Micrococcus flavus (ATCC 10240),  Escherichia coli (ATCC 35210), and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) were examined against essential oils of different treatments using the micro-dilution method (Elansary et al.,  2016).
2: In microtiter plates, known concentration of essential oil was mixed with bacterial inoculum in Triptic Soy broth, then kept at 37C for 24 h in a rotary shaker to determine the minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations (MICs and MBCs).
3: The MBC was determined using serial sub-cultivation of each essential oil (2 L) with each bacterium then incubated 24 h at 37C and the MBC was defined as the minimum concentration of the essential oil indicated killing off 99.5% of the of the inoculum.
4: The density was determined at 655 nm and all experiments were performed twice in triplicates.
5: Positive control (streptomycin and ampicillin, 0.0110 mg/ mL) as well as the DMSO (5%) negative controls were used.
