0: All chemicals were HPLC grade (Sigma, Egypt).
1: Uniform  R. officinallis L. plants that have 16 cm stems were obtained from local commercial nurseries.
2: The plants were identified and voucher specimen were maintained at Alexandria University, Egypt.
3: The plants were cultivated in a greenhouse and the experiments were repeated for two successive seasons in January 2016 and 2017.
4: Plants were transplanted into 3.1 L pots containing coarse sand and 2 g L 1 media of commercial compound fertilizer (Crystalon, 19% N: 19% P: 19% K).
5: Plants were maintained under moderate temperatures (15.124.5C); relative humidity (6881%) and photosynthetically active radiation (900 W m 2 at 12.00 p.m.).
6: The plants were irrigated with 250300 mL plant 1 of saline water every 2 days (640, 2,000, and 4,000 ppm NaCl) and 4 biweekly sprays of salicylic acid (SA) at 0, 100, 200, and 300 ppm until drop off for 8 weeks.
7: Plants subjected to salinity of 640 ppm NaCl (tap water) and 0 ppm salicylic acid sprays were considered as control.
8: The plants were distributed on three blocks and each treatment was represented by six replicates with a total number of plants of 216.
9: After 8 weeks, plant heights (cm) were measured then all plants were harvested.
10: Number of branches per plant was counted and the fresh weight (g) was measured then the dry weight (g) was obtained following drying at room temperature (20C) as reported by Elansary and Mahmoud ( 2015).
