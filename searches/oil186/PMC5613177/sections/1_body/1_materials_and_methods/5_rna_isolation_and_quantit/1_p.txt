0: Quantitative real-time PCR was conducted to evaluate the expression levels of APX gene, 3 SOD genes (FeSOD, Cu/ZnSOD, MnSOD) and 4 genes conferring tolerance to salinity (bZIP62, DREB2, ERF3, and OLPb) in the rosemary plants subjected to different SA treatments (0, 100, 200, 300 ppm) under different saline conditions (640, 2,000, 4,000 ppm).
1: RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen) was used to isolate the total RNA from these plant tissues.
2: Contaminating DNA was then removed.
3: cDNA was synthesized by using Reverse Transcription kit, and qRT-PCR was then carried out in triplicates using QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit.
4: The conditions for PCR amplification were 95C for 10 min; 50 cycles of 95C for 30 s, 62C for 30 s, and 72C for 2 min; then at 72C for 3 min.
5: Melting curve analysis was applied to test the amplification specificity.
6: Gene-specific primers of Radyukina et al.
7: ( 2011), Elansary et al.
8: ( 2017), and Kim et al.
9: ( 2017) were used for genes amplification.
10: Actin (Radyukina et al.,  2011) was used as a housekeeping gene, and the relative expression levels were determined using 2 Ct method.
