0: For essential oil extraction, a Clevenger-type apparatus was used for the hydrodistillation of dried ground leaf samples for 1 h, then the oil was dried, filtered, and finally kept at 4C in dark conditions (Elansary et al.,  2016).
1: The essential oils were subjected to Thermo Scientific Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer equipped with TG-1MS column.
2: The carrier gas was helium, and temperature ramped from 45165C at 4C min 1 for 2 min, then gradual increase to end temperature of 280C for 15 min.
3: The same column and temperatures were used for GC-FID analysis.
4: Chemical compounds were identified using their retention time and retention indices of  n-alkanes (C 10C 36) and computer matching using NIST mass spectra ver.
5: 2.0 and WILEY libraries as well as literature references (Chalchat et al.,  1993; Adams,  2007).
6: For the preparation of leaf extracts, ground dried leaves were dissolved in methanol (99%, 3 mL), maintained on a shaker in dark conditions for 1 h, then centrifuged for 5 min (4C, 7,000x  gr) and the supernatant was kept at 80C for further analyses.
