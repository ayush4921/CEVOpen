0: Identification of fatty acid composition of extracted  N. sativa oil was performed by means of a gas chromatography (Thermo Finnigan TRACE GC-Polaris Q, San Jose, CA, USA) equipped with mass spectrometry detector (Thermo Finnigan) and DB-Wax column (60 m 0.25 mm id 0.25 m film thickness; Supleco, MA, USA).
1: Helium was used as a carrier gas (1 mL/min).
2: Oven temperature was programmed at 70C for 5 minutes, then raised up to 230C at 2C/min and held for 10 minutes at 230C.
3: Injector temperature was 230C.
4: EI mass spectra was recorded at 70 eV ionization voltage over the mass range 40400 u.
5: For gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, 0.5 L of extract and mixture solvent (1:10) containing n-hexane and methanol (1:1 v/v) was injected under split mode (1:33).
