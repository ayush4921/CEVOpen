0: In this study, 150 g of the powdered sample was subjected into SFE equipment (SFE-1000F, Thar US Technology, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) at extraction temperature of 40C under 60 MPa.
1: SFE flow rate was maintained at 20 mL/min using a variable flow restrictor.
2: The yield was collected within 3 hours.
3: The collected pressure and temperature were 0.1 MPa and 25C, respectively.
4: The extraction was carried out with pure CO 2.
