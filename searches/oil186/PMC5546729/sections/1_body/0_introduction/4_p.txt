0: The desirable effect of  N. sativa on human diseases may be due to the presence of active compounds (ie, polyunsaturated fatty acids, TQ, phenolic compounds, and other natural anti-oxidants) in  N. sativa oil composition.
1: N. sativa seed contains 26.6% oil, of which the major fatty acids are linoleic acid (LA, 64.6%) and palmitic acid (20.4%) as reported in a previous study.
2: 17 Cheikh-Rouhou et al 18 also found that LA was the major unsaturated fatty acid in  N. sativa (50.3% Tunisian  NS and 49.2% Iranian  NS).
3: It was found that  N. sativa seeds contain 36%38% fixed oils, proteins, alkaloids, saponin, and 0.4%2.5% essential oil, and it was reported that the  N. sativa essential oil is mainly composed of TQ (27.8%57.0%), -cymene (7.1%15.5%), carvacrol (5.8%11.6%), t-anethole (0.25%2.3%), 4-terpineol (2%6.6%), and longifolene (1.0%8.0%).
4: 19 Fatty acid profiles were identified for  N. sativa seed oils.
5: Also LA and oleic acids are the main fatty acids of  N. sativa essential oil.
6: In addition, the  N. sativa essential oil contains considerable amounts of myristic acid (C14:0), arachidic acid (C20:0), and behenic acid (C22:0).
