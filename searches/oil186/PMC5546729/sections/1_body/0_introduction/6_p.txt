0: N. sativa oil is traditionally obtained by mechanical pressing or treating powdered  N. sativa seed with organic solvents, most commonly hexane.
1: Conventional solvent extraction techniques produce low-quality oil that requires extensive purification operations resulting in thermal degradation and loss of valuable compounds.
2: 25 The use of organic solvents and the necessity of recovering the solvent have led to a move toward cleaner extraction methods, such as supercritical fluid extraction (SFE).
3: SFE is becoming an efficient and worldwide used technique to obtain valuable natural substances from complex materials.
4: SFE-CO 2 has been utilized as a nontoxic alternative to hexane and other organic solvents for the extraction of oil from corn germ, 26 cottonseed, 27 rapeseed, 28 and other oil-bearing materials.
5: 29 Thus, the main objective of this study was to compare the oil extraction efficiency and essential oil composition of Iranian and Indian  N. sativa L. oil extracted by SFE and solvent extraction techniques.
