0: The components responsible for the antifungal activities were determined by applying 400 g of each essential oil onto three TLC plates and developed with  n-hexane/acetone, 90:10  v/ v. In one plate, the separated fraction bands were visualized with UV light (254 nm) and sprayed with Vanilin-Sulfuric Acid (VS) reagent followed by heating to 110 C for 5 min [ 24].
1: The other two plates were used for the bioautography assay.
2: According to the antifungal activity result, 7 mg of female flower and leaf essential oils were applied on chromatoplates, separately, and developed with the same solvent system.
3: At the exact R fs of the active bands, the plate was cut horizontally, washed with 1 mL of acetone, filtered (0.22 m filters, Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) and further analyzed by GC-MS, at the same conditions as the essential oils [ 25].
