0: The microorganisms used in antifungal assay,  Cladosporium cladosporioides (Fresen de Vries (CCIBt 140) and  C. sphaerospermum Penz (CCIBt 491), have been maintained at Instituto de Botanica, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.
1: For the antifungal assay, carried out by bioautography adapted from Homans & Fuchs method [ 23], 10 L of solutions corresponding to 200, 100, 50, and 25 g of essential oils in methanol were applied as single spots on pre-coated Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) plates (GF 254 silica-gel chromatoplates, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany).
2: Nystatin, thymol, and cinnamic acid (5 g) were used as positive controls.
3: The plates were sprayed with a suspension of salts and glucose (6:1) containing fungus spores (> 2  10 6 spores/mL) of  Cladosporium cladosporioides and  C. sphaerospermum.
4: The plates were incubated in moist chambers at 27 C for 48 h, in the dark.
5: After the incubation period, clear inhibition zones were observed as antifungal activity of the essential oils.
