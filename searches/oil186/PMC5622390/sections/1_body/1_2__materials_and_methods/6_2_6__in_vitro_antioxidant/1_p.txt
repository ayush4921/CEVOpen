0: The antioxidant activity was performed by the 2,2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl hydrate (DPPH) free radical scavenging method [ 26], adapted for microplates.
1: 178 L of the essential oils solubilized in methanol at concentrations between 4480560 g/mL were added to a 96-well microplate and 72 L of DPPH (0.3 mmol/L) solubilized in methanol were added.
2: Blank reading was performed with the test sample prior to the DPPH radical incubation.
3: As a negative control, 178 L of methanol was used.
4: As positive controls, quercetin from 20 to 0.625 g/mL and  Ginkgo biloba extract (Herbarium Laboratorio Botanico S.A., Parana, Brazil) from 40 to 1.25 g/mL were used.
5: The microplate was incubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature.
6: Then, the absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 518 nm using a multi-well scanning spectrophotometer (BIOTEK KC4, Winooski, VT, USA).
7: The absorbance was converted to percentage of antioxidant activity (AA) using the formula AA% = 100  {[(Abs  sample  Abs  blank)  100]/Abs  control}.
8: All samples were tested in triplicate and the results are expressed by mean  standard deviation.
9: The amount of essential oil required to reduce the initial DPPH concentration in the reaction by 50% is referred to as the inhibitory concentration (IC 50).
