0: The antioxidant activity was also evaluated by the -carotene bleaching test, which is based on spectrophotometric measurements of the -carotene oxidation induced by the lipoperoxidation products from linoleic acid [ 27] to determine the concentration providing 50% inhibition (IC 50).
1: The essential oil (10 L) solubilized in methanol at concentrations between 10,400325 g/mL was added in a 96-well microplate, together with 250 L of a reactive solution composed by -carotene and linoleic acid in water saturated with O 2.
2: Methanol (10 L) was used as the negative control and as the positive controls, butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylhydroxyanisole (BHA) at concentrations between 1304.1 g/mL.
3: The microplate was incubated in the dark at 45 C and subsequently the absorbance was read at 450 nm (multi-well scanner BIOTEK KC4, Winooski, VT, USA), immediately after adding the reactive solution and every 30 min for 2 h. The absorbance was converted to percentage of antioxidant activity (AA) using the AA% = 100  {[(Abs  final  Abs  initial)  100]/Abs  control}.
4: All samples were tested in triplicate and the results are expressed by mean  standard deviation.
