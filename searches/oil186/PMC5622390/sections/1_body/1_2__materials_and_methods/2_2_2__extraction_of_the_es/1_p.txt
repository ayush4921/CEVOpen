0: Nine male and female specimens were collected.
1: Leaves and flowers were pooled to provide representative homogeneous samples of the population, separated into three replicates and stored under refrigeration (22 C) until extraction.
2: Essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation for 3.5 h in a Clevenger-type apparatus.
3: The crude oil was separated, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and stored in a glass flask at 22 C until GC-MS analysis and biological activities.
4: The oil yields were calculated based on the oil and fresh plant material weights as mean  standard deviation of the triplicates [ 18].
