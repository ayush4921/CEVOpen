0: Essential oils were solubilized in acetone 1:100  v/ v (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany).
1: Chemical analysis of the essential oils was performed on an Agilent 6890 Series GC (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), interfaced with a 5973 Series quadrupole MS detector (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and equipped with a DB-5MS column (30 m  0.25 mm i.d.
2: 0.25 m) (Agilent J&W, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
3: Chromatography conditions were as follows; oven temperature program: 40 C for 1 min with subsequent temperature increase of 3 C/min up to 240 C, keeping it at this temperature for 10 min.
4: ; carrier gas: He at a flow rate of 1 mL/min; injector and detector temperature of 250 C; electron ionization: 70 eV.
5: The component abundances were expressed as the mean  standard deviation of the triplicates.
6: The essential oil components were identified by comparing the retention indices (evaluated in relation to the retention times of a series of  n-alkanes) and by comparison of their mass spectra with those reported in the literature [ 20, 21].
