0: Hedyosmum brasiliense Mart.
1: ex Miq., popularly known as cha de bugre, cidreira, or cidrao, is a dioecious shrub distributed throughout central and southern Brazilian regions and western Paraguay [ 9, 10].
2: Its leaves have been used in folk medicine to treat migraine, ovarium dysfunction, foot fungi, rheumatism, stomach pain, and as a diuretic [ 1, 2].
3: Chemical and pharmacological studies with the aerial parts of  H. brasiliense indicated analgesic, anxiolytic, antidepressive, and aphrodisiac effects for the crude extracts and for some isolated sesquiterpene lactones [ 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].
4: There are also some reports on the antimicrobial activity for the ethanol extract [ 17] and the essential oils [ 18, 19], however none of them could attribute the observed bioactivity to a specific compound.
5: The essential oil presented as major compounds specimen sabinene, (Z)--guaiene and pinocarvone, for a Sao Paulo State [ 18], and pinocarvone, curzerene and carotol, for one from Santa Catarina State [ 19].
6: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the chemical composition and biological activities of  H. brasiliense flower essential oils.
7: In addition, this is also the first time that the antioxidant activity is described for this species.
8: Therefore, this work aims to investigate the chemical composition of the essential oils from  H. brasiliense male and female flowers and leaves collected at Ilha do Cardoso (Sao Paulo, Brazil) and to compare their antifungal and antioxidant activities, as well as to identify the main antifungal constituents in the essential oils.
