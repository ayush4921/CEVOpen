0: The AIT was performed as described by Drummond et al.
1: [ 25] with minor modifications.
2: The ticks were distributed to groups randomly (20 engorged females per group).
3: The different groups of  R.
4: (B.)
5: microplus were immersed for 1 min in 5 mL of the respective concentrations (2.5%, 5%, and 10%) of  C. limonum and  P. nigrum by placing them directly into a 50 mL Falcon-type tube which was gently agitated at room temperature.
6: In experiments of additive effects we used the ratio 1 : 1 (vol/vol) of each oil, with a final concentration of 2.5%, 5%, and 10%.
7: Ticks were recovered from the solutions and dried and each group was transferred to Petri dish (9 cm diameter, 1,5 cm high), weighed, and kept in BOD incubator at a temperature of 28C and relative humidity of 7080% for oviposition.
8: This experiment was performed three times in duplicate.
9: The emulsifying solution (2% DMSO) was used as the negative control, while Amitraz (2  L/mL) and Deltamethrin (1  L/mL) in water were used as positive control.
10: The mortality was observed during 15 days.
11: The dead ticks were diagnosed based on three specific signs and features: increasing cuticle darkness and stopping Malpighian tube movement and hemorrhagic skin lesions.
12: After 15 days, the eggs laid were placed in glass tube, weighed, and observed separately at the same condition of incubation for the next 30 days for visual estimation of hatching rate.
