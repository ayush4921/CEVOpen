0: The experiment was conducted in two phases.
1: Essential oils were tested separately and after mixing were performed at equal concentrations, in 1 : 1 proportions (50%  Citrus limonum and 50%  Piper nigrum).
2: The essential oils of  C. limonum and  P. nigrum were dissolved in an aqueous solution with 2% dimethyl sulfoxide (v/v) as an emulsifying agent, as described by Gazim et al.
3: in [ 24].
4: Solutions were serially diluted in order to obtain the concentrations of 2.5%, 5%, and 10% (v/v), obtaining a final volume of 5 mL.
5: The emulsifying solution (2% DMSO) was used as the negative control.
6: A control with water was also carried out.
7: Amitraz (2  L/mL) and Deltamethrin (1  L/mL) in water were used as positive control.
8: The test was repeated three times in duplicate.
