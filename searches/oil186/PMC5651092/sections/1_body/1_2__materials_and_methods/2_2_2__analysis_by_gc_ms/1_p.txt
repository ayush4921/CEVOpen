0: The crude essential oil was analyzed on a GC-MS QP2010 (SHIMADZU) gas chromatograph equipped with a mass spectrometer using electron impact ionization detection.
1: The gas chromatographic (GC) conditions were as follows: injector temperature: 260C; detector temperature: 290C; carrier gas (Helium): flow rate 1 mL/min; and split injection with split ratio 1 : 40.
2: Oven temperature was raised from 60C to 290C at a rate of 3C/min.
3: One microliter of each sample, dissolved in CH2Cl2 (1 : 100 mg/ L), was injected on a RTX-5 column (i.d.
4: = 0.25 mm, length 30 m, film thickness = 0.25  m).
5: Mass spectra (MS) were recorded 70 eV and scan rate of 1 scan/s.
6: The retention indices were calculated by interpolation of retention times of the substances to the retention times of a mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons (C7-C40) (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, St Louis, MO) analyzed in the same conditions (Van den Dool H. & Kratz).
7: The identification of substances was performed by comparison of their retention indices and mass spectra with those reported in literature [ 23].
8: The MS fragmentation pattern of compounds was also checked with NIST mass spectra libraries.
