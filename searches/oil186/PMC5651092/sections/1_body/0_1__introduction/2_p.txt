0: One of the strategies to minimize the economic losses caused by this pest involves reducing tick populations to economically acceptable levels [ 6].
1: But the inherent problems in controlling this parasite are acaricide resistance, and environmental residues resulted in only partial success of tick control [ 7].
2: The searches for environmentally safe products have accelerated the research on botanical acaricides [ 8,  9].
3: Plants have been used as food, spices, and medicines for thousands of years.
4: These medicines initially took the form of crude drugs such as a variety of plants formulations.
5: Natural products have been the origin of many important molecules in drug discoveries.
6: Different culinary herbs have been screened for their biological activities.
7: The active ingredients from plants are known to possess insecticidal, growth inhibiting, antimoulting, and repellent activities [ 8].
8: Thus, there is increasing interest in alternative methods for tick control and growing demand for nonchemical products in livestock that are safer to animals and the environment [ 10,  11].
9: Botanical alternatives, such as essential oils, are currently receiving particular attention [ 12].
