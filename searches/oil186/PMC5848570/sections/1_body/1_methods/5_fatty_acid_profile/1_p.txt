0: The fatty acid profile of oil samples were determined by gas chromatography coupled to a flame ionization detector (GC-FID).
1: Briefly, the fatty acid methyl esters were prepared by transesterification, using 2% sulfuric acid in methanol [ 16].
2: Analysis were performed on a gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA), serial number 7890A, coupled to a flame ionization detector, using a capillary column DB-225 (30 m  0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 m).
3: The initial column temperature was 160 C for 2 min, then increased to 220 C (5 C/min) and maintained for 10 min.
4: Nitrogen was used as mobile phase with flow rate 1.5 ml/min.
5: The temperature of the injector and detector were maintained at 230 C and 250 C respectively for 20 min.
6: The identification of fatty acid was based on the comparison of retention time with that of standard reference fatty acid methyl esters performed under same conditions.
