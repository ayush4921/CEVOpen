0: C. nigrodigitatus fleshes were dried 24 h in an oven at 45 C. Samples were further ground to yield a fine powder.
1: 100 g powder was mixed with 500 ml hexane, macerated and stirred three times within 24 h. Upon maceration, the homogenate was filtered and concentrated under vacuum using rotary vapour (40 C).
