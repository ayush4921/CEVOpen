0: The oils antibacterial activity was evaluated by broth microdilution method in a 96-wells microtitre plates [ 17].
1: Bacterial suspensions of about 1.5  10 8 CFU/ml (Mc Farland turbidity standard no.
2: 0.5) was prepared from an overnight culture.
3: The inoculum was obtained following 100 times dilution (1.5  10 6 CFU/ml).
4: The oil stock solution was prepared in 5% tween 20.
5: A series of two fold dilutions were performed to obtain final concentration range of 0.5 to 64 mg/ml in a total volume of 100 l/well.
6: Each well was further diluted with 100 ml inoculum.
7: Plates were further incubated at 35 C for 18 h. Growth was monitored using  P- iodotetrazolium chloride (INT; 0.2 mg/ml)) [ 18].
8: Viable bacteria change the yellow dye of iodonitrotetrazolium to a pink colour.
9: The lowest concentration of oil, at which no visible colour change was noted was considered as MIC.
10: Ciprofloxacin was used as positive control at concentrations ranging from 0.0625 to128 g/ml.
