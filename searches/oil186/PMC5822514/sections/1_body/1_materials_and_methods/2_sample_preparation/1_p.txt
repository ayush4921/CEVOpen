0: 200 g of washed and fresh aerial part (leaves and stems) of  S. macrostema plants were subjected to hydrodistillation in a Clevenger-type apparatus, mixing together with 1000 mL of distilled water in a round flask.
1: The operating temperature was 100C and the extraction was done between 2 and 4 h. The essential oil was separated from the hydrolyte by liquidliquid partitioning in separating fennel and removed with a micropipette.
2: This was suspended in methanol at a final concentration of 1.0 mg/mL and stored at 4C in the dark until gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and antioxidant activity analysis.
