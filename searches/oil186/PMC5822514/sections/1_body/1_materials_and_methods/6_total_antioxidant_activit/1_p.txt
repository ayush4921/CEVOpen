0: The total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of the essential oil and terpenes was evaluated according to the method described by Prieto  et al.
1: [ 29] An aliquot of 100 L of sample solution was combined with 900 L of reagent solution (0.6 M sulfuric acid, 28 mM sodium phosphate, and 4 mM ammonium molybdate) (Sigma-Aldrich, Mexico).
2: For the blank, 100 L of deionized water was used in place of the sample.
3: The tubes were incubated in a boiling water bath at 95C for 90 min.
4: After the samples were cooled at room temperature, the absorbance of the aqueous solution of each sample was measured at 695 nm in the spectrophotometer (Genesys 10 UV, Thermo Scientific).
5: The total antioxidant activity was calculated by the following equation:
