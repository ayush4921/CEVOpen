0: The percentage of essential oil constituents was determined by integration of peak areas, the values shown correspond to the average value of three injections.
1: The compounds were identified by comparison of their retention indices, relative to those of n-alkanes C8C20, and by comparison with a library of mass spectra with the NIST02 mass spectral library (National Institute of Standards and Technology), as well as by comparison of their retention indices with those described by Adams.
2: [ 26] Quantitative determination was based on the total ion count detected by the GC-MS.
