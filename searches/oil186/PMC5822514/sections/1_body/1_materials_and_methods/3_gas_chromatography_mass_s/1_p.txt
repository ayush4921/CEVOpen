0: The chemical composition of the essential oil and major terpene quantification were realized using GC and GC/MS data techniques reported by Torres-Martinez  et al.
1: [ 23] 1 L of the sample was injected into an Agilent Technologies (7890A) GC equipped with a mass detector (Agilent 5975C), which operated using helium as a carrying gas, with a flow of 1 mL/min, with a split injection (split 50:1) at a temperature of 250C in HP 5MS nonpolar capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm internal diameter  0.25 m film), under the following conditions: initial temperature of 50C, followed by a 5C/min ramp to attain a temperature of 280C during 1 min; another 25C/min ramp to raise the temperature to 380C, during up to 3 min.
2: The runtime was 50 min.
3: The MS operated at a flow speed of 1 mL/min, with an ionization voltage of 70 eV, at an interface temperature of 250C, in a SCAN mode, and at a mass interval of 50500 m/z.
