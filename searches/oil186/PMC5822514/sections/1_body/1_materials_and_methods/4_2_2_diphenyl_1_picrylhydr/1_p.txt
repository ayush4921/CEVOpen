0: Measurement of the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) (Sigma-Aldrich, Mexico) radical scavenging capacity was carried out according to Karamac  et al.
1: [ 27] Briefly, two mL of 0.5 mmol/L DPPH in methanol (Meyer, Mexico) was mixed with 100 L of different concentrations of essential oil of  S. macrostema and using major pure terpenes in it (limonene, linalool, pulegone, menthone, thymol, and caryophyllene; Sigma-Aldrich, Mexico) (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 mg/mL).
2: After 20 min incubation, the absorbance was measured at 517 nm with ultravioletvisible (UV/VIS) spectrophotometer (Genesys 10UV, Thermo Scientific).
3: The percentage of free radical-scavenging capacity was calculated by the following equation:
