0: The radical scavenging capacity of the essential oil and major terpenes of  S. macrostema were assayed with an 2,2-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) (Sigma-Aldrich, Mexico) assay according to the protocol of Rufino  et al.
1: [ 28] with some modifications.
2: The ABTS radical solution was prepared mixing 7.4 mmol/L ABTS and 2.6 mmol/L potassium persulfate (Meyer, Mexico).
3: Samples of 100 L were subsequently mixed with 1900 L ABTS radical solution, and the absorbance of the resulting mixtures was measured after 7 min at 737 nm with UV/VIS spectrophotometer.
4: The free radical-scavenging capacity was calculated by the following equation:
