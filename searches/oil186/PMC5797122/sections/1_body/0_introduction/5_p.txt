0: Introducing plant based mosquito repellents to vulnerable populations faces economic challenges but also societal and governmental hurdles.
1: Furthermore, they must be nontoxic with respect to dermal and eye contact, ingestion, and inhalation.
2: Unlike synthetic repellents, the chemical composition of essential oils, like  N. cataria, contain dozens of compounds (Supplemental information S1).
3: The active ingredient must demonstrate its efficacy versus alternatives but they must also be stable with respect to UV exposure, oxidation and high temperature (>40 C).
4: Moreover, to achieve the largest possible distribution at the lowest cost, local populations must grow, harvest and extract the active ingredients.
5: Birkett and Pickett discovered the efficacy of nepetolactone and nepetolactol in repelling aphids.
6: They distilled the catnip with steam and cyclohexane vapors then reduced the oil with NaBH 4.
7: In their concluding remarks, they emphasize the potential of plants as source of commercialy vailable products 37.
8: Here we address the challenges of cultivating  N. cataria in Burundi and developing a topical mosquito repellent.
9: We compare the composition of the essential oil versus those cultivated throughout the world and measure the thermal stability and its stability versus UV.
10: Finally, we demonstrate that the population is ready to test the mosquito repellents formulated with vegetable oil or as Pickering emulsions based on an acceptability study we conducted in a rural and urban region of the country.
