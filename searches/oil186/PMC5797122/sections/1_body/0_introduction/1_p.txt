0: Malaria is a leading cause of human mortality.
1: In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) 1 estimated that 212 million cases of malaria occurred, leading to 419 000 deaths  82% of casualties are in sub-Saharan Africa.
2: Children under the age of 5 account for 64% of victims.
3: Malarias mortality rate dropped by 31% between 2010 and 2015 in Africa and the life expectancy of children under 5 increased by 1.2 years.
4: However, in 80% of malaria endemic countries, mosquitos developed resistance to at least one insecticide.
5: Furthermore, in Burundi, deaths have increased by 13% in the last year 2, stunting economic growth 3 where the annual per capita income is lower than 400 USD 4 and farmers hire labour at 1 USD a day.
6: As with the mass drug administration of chloroquine, which contributed to the resurgence of malaria in Peru after 30 years of low incidence 5,  Plasmodium falciparum protozoa may develop resistance to artemisinin monotherapy 6.
7: Mutations of the K13 gene are markers of artemisinin resistance but tetraoxane-based compounds have inhibitory characteristics against various strains of the protozoa 7.
8: Artesunate is more effective than quinine with fewer side effects but a child administered a high dose rectally died due to its toxicity 8.
9: Moreover, Burke  et al.
10: 9 reported that  Anopheles vaneedeni became a new malaria vector complicating the fight against the disease.
