0: Cutaneous mosquito repellents (MR) are one means to reduce the frequency of mosquito bites.
1: N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) is an effective mosquito repellant 17  20 but is cost prohibitive for rural sub-Saharan populations.
2: Targeting indigenous plants as a source of mosquito repellents will stimulate local economies and at the same time protect the population.
3: Odalo  et al.
4: 21 extracted and tested the topical repellency of essential oils indigenous to Kenya from  Conyza newii (Compositae),  Plectranthus marrubioides (Lamiaceae),  Lippia javanica (Verbenaceae),  Tetradenia riparia (Lamiaceae), as well as  Tarchonanthus camphoratus (Asteraceae).
5: The oils, under their experimental conditions (3 min, forearm exposure), repelled mosquitoes better than DEET.
6: N. cataria, commonly known as catnip or catmint, is a species of the Lamiaceae family.
7: It is native to temperate and tropical zones in Asia and in Europe and is widely cultivated 22.
8: Nepeta cataria ( N. cataria) has many uses in traditional medicine including treatment of chills, colds, constipation, headaches, infections, inflammations, rheumatism, sore throats, spasms, and stomach aches 23.
9: N. catarias essential oil possesses antibacterial and antimicrobial properties 24,  25.
10: Nepetalactone (NPL) is the major constituent of this oil 26  29.
11: DEET, applied to the forearm, repelled  Aedes aegypti,  Anopheles quadrimaculatus, and  Anopheles albimanus for 426 min, 96 min, and 87 min, respectively 29.
12: A 25% volume fraction of DEET in ethanol repelled  Aedes aegypti for 8 h 30.
13: Whereas, Bernier found that a dose of 0.5 mg cm 2 of DEET applied to a muslin cloth patch was active for 24 h. Catnips oil is a better spatial repellent than DEET and demonstrated effective topical repellency properties 31.
