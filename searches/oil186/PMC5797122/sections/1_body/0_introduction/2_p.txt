0: Preventing rather than treating the disease is a better approach; sleeping under nets impregnated with insecticides has reduced the world mortality rate from 2 million a year; they save 5.5 per 1000 children yearly 10.
1: Insecticides are losing their efficacy due to increasing mosquito resistance 11.
2: Furthermore, weather patterns like La Nina can cause unexpected peaks in mosquito populations 12.
3: Graves and Gelband 13 tested SPf66, CS-NANP, RTS,S, MSP/RESA vaccines and their ability to prevent different stages of malaria.
4: Theoretically, SPf66 and MSP/RESA protect against the asexual stages of plasmodium parasites whereas the other two target the sporozoite stages.
5: CS-NANP and MSP/RESA offered no protection against malaria, SPf66 was ineffective and RTS,S reduced malaria episodes by 58%.
6: Unfortunately, vaccines mass production and distribution is too expensive for sub-Saharan Africa 14.
7: Furthermore, the mosquitos are changing their feeding patterns to adapt to the mosquito nets.
8: Moiroux  et al.
9: 15 demonstrated that mosquitos have adapted to insecticide treated nets by changing their biting habits.
10: Proportion of outdoor biting increased from 45% to 68% 16.
11: Thus, nets will be less effective for young children and pregnant women, who are the most vulnerable to the disease.
