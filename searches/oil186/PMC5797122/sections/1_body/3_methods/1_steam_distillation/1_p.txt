0: KarireProducts cultivated  N. cataria in the Moso region in the province of RUTANA, Burundi, picked the leaves at full bloom, and air-dried them for 30 hours.
1: In a 5 hour process, a stainless steel steam distillation system isolated essential oil from chopped dried plant material (20 to 25 kg/batch).
2: We stored the essential oil in amber containers at low temperature (4 C).
3: A propane burner boiled water at the bottom of a tank and the steam it generated passed through a metal mesh that was supporting the weight of the leaves.
4: The steam first heats the biomass.
5: After one hour, both oil and water vapour broke through to the top of the distillation column and passed through a pipe at the top lead to a condenser.
6: The condensed solution separated in a second vessel and we collected both the hydrosol and essential oil.
