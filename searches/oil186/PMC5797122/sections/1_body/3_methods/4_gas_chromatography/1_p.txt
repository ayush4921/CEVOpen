0: N. cataria oil is a clear pale yellow liquid, with a refraction index of 1.4882  0.0005 (23 C).
1: We diluted the samples in HPLC grade pentane (1:200).
2: A gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionisation detector (GC-FID) and another GC coupled to a mass spectrometer (GC-MS) quantified the main components of the essential oil.
3: The GC-FID was equipped with a DB-5 column (30 m  0.25 mm  0.25 m; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), while the GC-MS had a Solgel-Wax column (30 m  0.25 mm  0.25 m; SGE Analytical Science, Austin, TX, USA).
4: We set both GCs injection port and detector temperature at 220 C and 260 C, respectively.
5: Helium carried analytes at a flow rate of 1.4 mL/minute.
6: Temperature remained at 40 C for 2 minutes, then increased to 210 C at a rate of 2 C/minute.
7: The split ratio was 50:1 and the injection volume was 3 microlites.
8: The mass spectrometer operated in electron-impact (EI) mode at 70 eV, with a scan range of 40550 amu and a scan speed of 1458.6 amu/s.
9: The temperature of the MS interface was 300 C. We computed FID peak areas without a correction factor.
10: The retention times of n-alkanes with an even number of hydrocarbons (C8C24) injected using the same analytical conditions determined the retention indices of the essential oil constituents.
11: We qualitatively identified all the compounds from the NIST library 57.
12: To identify the geometrical isomers we injected standards, purchased from Sigma Aldrich.
