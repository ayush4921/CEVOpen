3: Both were hyper endemic malaria regions.
4: Each family received 2 bottles with 100 mL of the lotion.
5: The volunteers included one pregnant woman, 10 children younger than 5 y, 19 children from 5 to 11 y, 11 adolescents from 12 to 20 y, and 20 adults older than 20 y of which most of these were farmers (17).
6: There were 32 males and 28 females in the study.
