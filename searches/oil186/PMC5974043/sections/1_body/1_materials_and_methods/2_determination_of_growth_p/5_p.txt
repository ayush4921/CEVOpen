0: The AOAC the standard method was applied for feed materials and experiment diets in order to determine moisture, ash, crude protein, and lipid ( Helrich, 1990).
1: The samples were digested with acid by using the auto Kjeldahl system and crude protein was detected according to Kjeldahl method.
2: Soxtec system was used by the ether extraction method to determine crude lipid, moisture was determined using by oven drying at 105C until constant weight was reached.
3: The samples were placed in a muffle furnace at 550C for 24 h and then ash content was measured.
