0: A pathogenic pathogen  Y. ruckeri (E42 Accession No: KX388238) was used.
1: A stock of bacteria stored in tryptic soy broth containing 15% glycerol was prepared and maintained at -80C.
2: Briefly, 2 days before the challenge an aliquot of the bacteria was grown in tryptic soy broth medium at 22C in a shaker incubator.
3: After 1 day, the bacterial suspension was serially diluted in sterile PBS until the stock bacteria contained 10 7 colony forming units (cfu)/mL.
