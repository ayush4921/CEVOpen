0: Analyses of the cold-press oil were performed using a Shimadzu GCMS QP 2010 ULTRA GCMS system operating in the EI mode 0.70 kW, equipped with a split/splitless injector (250C).
1: The interface temperature was 250C.
2: Helium was used as carrier gas (1.26 mL/min) in capillary column and the capillary column used was: RTX-5MS (30 m; 0.25 mm; 0.25 m).
3: The temperature program was the same with that used for the GC analysis; split ratio 1:5.
4: The injected volume was 1 L. Acquisition mass range 45450 m/z.
5: The identification of the compounds was based on comparison of their retention times (RTs), and/or Wiley libraries, and the literature ( Adams, 2007).
