0: The method of  Blaxhall and Daisley (1973) was used to determine red blood cell (RBC) count ( 10 6 per mm 3), hematocrit (Hct; %), and hemoglobin (Hb) concentration (g/L).
1: The RBC count was obtained with a Thoma hemocytometer using Dacies diluting fluid.
2: A capillary Hct tube was used to determine the Hct value.
3: The Hb concentration was measured by spectrophotometry (540 nm) via the cyanmethemoglobin method.
4: Mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular Hb (MCH), and mean corpuscular Hb concentrations (MCHC) were calculated with the following formulae ( Bain et al., 2006):
