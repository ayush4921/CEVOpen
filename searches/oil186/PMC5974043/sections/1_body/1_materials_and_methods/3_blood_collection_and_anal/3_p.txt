0: Serum lysozyme activity was assessed using turbidimetric analysis ( Nudo and Catap, 2011).
1: 25 L of each serum were mixed with 175 L of  Micrococcus luteus (Sigma, ATCC 4698) suspension at 0.75 mg/mL in phosphate/citrate buffer.
2: The mixture was incubated at 25C, and its OD was measured after 30 min at 530 nm using a plate reader (Thermo Multiskan Go).
3: Hen egg white lysozyme was used as an external standard.
4: The rate of reduction was converted in absorbance of the samples to lysozyme concentration (g/mL) using a standard curve.
