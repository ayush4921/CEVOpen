0: Protium amazonicum (Cuatrec.)
1: Daly belongs to the Burseraceae, which is comprised of 640 species representing 18 genera throughout the world, mainly distributed in the Neotropics and North Africa [ 1].
2: The main characteristic of the Burseraceae is the exuding aromatic resin [ 2, 3], which is known as copal in Spanish [ 4] and breu in Portuguese [ 5].
3: Protium spp.
4: have been used in the treatment of various diseases and conditions such as ulcers and wounds, to treat headaches, toothaches, and rheumatism [ 2], because of their anti-inflammatory [ 6, 7], antinociceptive [ 8, 9], antineoplastic [ 10], and gastroprotective [ 11, 12] properties.
5: The Yanomami people of Brazil use the resin of  P. fimbriatum to treat respiratory infections [ 13].
6: Protium oleoresins have been characterized in terms of color, age, odor, as well as volatile and non-volatile chemical characteristics ( Table 1) [ 5, 14].
7: Because of the importance of  Protium oleoresins in traditional medicine and because no previous work had been carried out on  P. amazonicum, we wished to chemically characterize the oleoresin essential oil of  P. amazonicum; this information should add to our understanding of  Protium oleoresin chemistry.
