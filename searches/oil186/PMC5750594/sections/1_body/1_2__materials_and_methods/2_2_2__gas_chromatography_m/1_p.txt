0: The oleoresin essential oil of  P. amazonicum was analyzed by GC-MS using a Shimadzu GC-MS-QP2010 Ultra (Shimadzu Corp., Columbia, MD, USA) operated in the electron impact (EI) mode (electron energy = 70 eV), with a scan range of 40400 atomic mass units (amu), a scan rate of 3.0 scans/s, and the GC-MS Solution software (Shimadzu GC-MS-QP2010 Ultra, Columbia, MD, USA).
1: The GC column was ZB-5MS fused silica capillary column (Phenomenex Inc., Torrance, CA, USA) (30 mL  0.25 mm ID) with a (5% phenyl)-polymethylsiloxane stationary phase with a film thickness of 0.25 m. The carrier gas was helium with a column head pressure of 551.6 kPa and flow rate of 1.37 mL/min.
2: The injector temperature was 250 C, and the ion source temperature was 200 C. The GC oven temperature program was programmed for 50 C initial temperature, the temperature increased at a rate of 2 C/min to 260 C. A 5%  w/ v solution of the sample in CH 2Cl 2 was prepared and 0.1 L was injected with a splitting mode (30:1).
3: Identification of the oil components was based on their retention indices determined by reference to a homologous series of  n-alkanes, and by comparison of their mass spectral fragmentation patterns with those reported in the literature [ 30], and stored in the MS library.
