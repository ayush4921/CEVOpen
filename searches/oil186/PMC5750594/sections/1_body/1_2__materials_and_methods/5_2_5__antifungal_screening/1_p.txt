0: The broth microdilution method was performed to determine antifungal activity as previously reported [ 31, 32].
1: Briefly, cultures of  Candida albicans (ATCC 18804) and  Cryptococcus neoformans var.
2: neoformans (ATCC 24067) were initially grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates for 72 h at 37 C. A single colony was used to inoculate approximately 5 mL of potato dextrose broth (PDB) which was subsequently grown for an additional 24 h at 37 C.  Aspergillus niger (ATCC 16888) cultures were grown on PDA plates for 5 days at room temperature (RT, 22 C).
3: A. niger conidia were collected, placed in PDB, and filtered through sterile cheesecloth into fresh PDB.
4: The absorbance of the fresh solution was read at 625 nm and adjusted accordingly with PDB to an absorbance of 0.15.
5: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined in triplicate using 96-well plates.
6: C. albicans and  C. neoformans were diluted in 3-( N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) buffered Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium to 2000 cells/mL whereas  A. niger was diluted with PDB to an OD 625 of 0.15.
7: Initially, 50 L of MOPS buffered RPMI was added to each well of the plate.
8: In the first row, 50 L of essential oil was added and mixed well, then 50 L of this mixture was removed and then added to the medium in the next row.
9: This serial dilution process was repeated for each row of the plate, with the removed volume from the last row being discarded.
10: To each well was added 50 L of cells to achieve a final volume of 100 L.  C. albicans and  C. neoformans were incubated at 37 C for 48 h. The  A. niger plates were incubated at RT for 6 days.
11: The MIC was determined from turbidity or growth on the plates in comparison to positive and negative controls.
12: In order to verify the results, MIC determinations were carried out in nine replicates.
13: A combination of Cyprodinil and Fludioxonil served as the positive control with MOPS buffered RPMI serving as the negative control.
