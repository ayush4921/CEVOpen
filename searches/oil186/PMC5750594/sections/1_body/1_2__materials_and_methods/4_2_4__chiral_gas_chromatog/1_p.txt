0: Chiral analysis of the  P. amazonicum oil was performed on a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010S (Shimadzu Corp., Columbia, MD, USA) operated in the EI mode (electron energy = 70 eV), scan range = 40400 amu, scan rate = 3.0 scans/s.
1: GC equipped with a Restek B-Dex 325 capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm ID  0.25 m film) (Restek Corp., Bellefonte, PA, USA).
2: Oven temperature was started at 50 C, and then gradually raised to 120 C at 1.5 C/min.
3: The oven was then raised to 200 C at 2 C/min and held for 5 min.
4: Helium was the carrier gas and the flow rate was maintained at 1.8 mL/min.
5: The sample was diluted 3%  w/ v with CH 2Cl 2 and then a 0.1 L sample was injected in a split mode with a split ratio of 1:45.
6: The enantiomers of each monoterpene were identified by comparison of retention times to authentic samples obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI, USA).
