0: In the case of argan oil, the literature does not report studies of the impact of roasting on the chemical composition of the oil, with the exception of the study by Harhar et al.
1: [ 11] in which only the duration of the roasting was taken into consideration for a constant temperature of 110C.
2: The objective of this work was to evaluate the concomitant effects of the temperature and the duration of the roasting of the  A. spinosa almonds on the chemical composition of the oil.
3: To do this, the roasting was carried out by combining temperatures of 75, 100, 125, 150, and 175C with times of 10, 20, and 30 min.
4: The chemical composition of the oil related to the content of fatty acids, tocopherols, and phospholipids.
5: The physicochemical parameters considered were acidity, peroxide value (PV), absorbance at 232 nm (K232) and 270 nm (K270), and browning index (assessed by absorbance at 420 nm).
