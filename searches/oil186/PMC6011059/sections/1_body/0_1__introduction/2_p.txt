0: In industry, heating of oilseeds is carried out with the aim of increasing oil extraction yield, reducing seed moisture, and deactivating lipases and lipoxygenases which could induce fatty acids (FA) oxidation [ 2].
1: The oxidation could lead to loss of nutritional value and decreased shelf life [ 3].
2: The roasting of oilseeds could also improve the stability of vegetable oils by increasing the extraction yield of antioxidant substances [ 4,  5].
3: As regards the effect of roasting on the content of tocopherols which represent the major antioxidants of vegetable oils, the data from the literature are inconsistent.
4: Depending on the nature and variety of oilseeds, roasting may lead to a decrease [ 5 7] or an increase in tocopherols level in oil [ 8 10].
5: Since tocopherols are thermosensitive, their final concentration in the oil will depend essentially on the temperature and the duration of the roasting.
