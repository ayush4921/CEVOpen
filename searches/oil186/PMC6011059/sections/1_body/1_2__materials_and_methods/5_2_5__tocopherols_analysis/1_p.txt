0: The analysis of tocopherols was carried out using high performance liquid chromatography (Flexar, Perkinelmer, USA).
1: The apparatus was equipped with a C18 column (250 mm length, 4 mm internal diameter, and 5  m particle size; Varian Inc.) and a fluorescence detector.
2: The excitation and detection wavelengths were 290 and 330 nm, respectively.
3: The mobile phase consisted of 2:98 tetrahydrofuran/hexane (v/v) mixture and the flow rate was 1 ml/min.
4: Oil samples were diluted in hexane (0.1g/ml) before analysis.
