0: The phospholipids content was estimated by measuring phosphorous according to AOCS recommended method Ca 12-5515 [ 15].
1: The method is based on ashing the oil sample in the presence of zinc oxide.
2: The phosphorus is then determined by a spectrophotometric measurement as a blue phosphomolybdic acid complex (Varian DMS 80 spectrophotometer).
3: The phospholipids content is obtained by multiplying the phosphorus content by 25.
