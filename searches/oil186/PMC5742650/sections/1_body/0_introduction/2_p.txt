0: Traditional methods used for extraction of essential oil were Hydro-distillation (HD) or steam distillation.
1: However, the loss of some components and the degradation of some unsaturated compounds by thermal effects  7,  8 or by hydrolysis can take place by these conventional extraction techniques.
2: These disadvantages have changed the approach of the recent research and stimulated the intensification, optimization and improvement of existing and novel green extraction techniques  9,  10 .
3: Some of these methods are: Ultrasound-Assisted Extraction, Microwave-Assisted Extraction and CO   2  supercritical extraction.
4: The supercritical fluid extraction of rosemary with CO   2  has been the object of many researches  11 and has become a valid alternative to the more conventional extraction procedures, mainly because the dissolving power of the extracting medium can be adjusted by regulating pressure and temperature conditions.
5: However, the high cost of producing specific products has limited its use.
6: In certain cases, the extractive power of supercritical CO   2  is insufficient under conventional conditions.
7: Microwave-assisted solvent extraction appeared to be particularly attractive for isolation of essential oil  12,  13 .
8: Microwave-assisted Hydro-distillation (MAHD) combines rapid heating in the microwave field with the traditional solvent extraction.
9: This significantly enables saving of time, so the extraction can be completed in meter of minutes  14,  15 .
10: In an attempt to take advantage of microwave heating with the conventional HD, MAHD was developed and used for the extraction of essential oils from  Xylopia aromatica (Lamarck) and  Lippia alba (Mill)  16,  17 .
