0: Tigrine-Kordjani  et al18 developed a Microwave Assisted Distillation (MAD) with free solvent for laboratory scale applications in the extraction of essential oils from different kinds of aromatic plant.
1: Sui  et al19 have worked on an efficient Microwave Pretreatment (MP) method to maintain quality of postharvest rosemary leaves and observed that MP could be a good method for extracting essential oil and maintaining quality in rosemary and other aromatic herbs.
2: Lucchesi  et al20 had a study on comparing solvent-free microwave extraction of essential oil from aromatic herbs with conventional hydro-distillation.
3: They found that the SFME method yields an essential oil with higher amounts of more valuable oxygenated compounds, and allows substantial savings of costs, in terms of time, energy and plant material.
4: SFME is a green technology and appears as a good alternative for the extraction of essential oils from aromatic plants.
