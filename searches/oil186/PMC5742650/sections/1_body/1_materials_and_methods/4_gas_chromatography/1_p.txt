0: The essential oils obtained at different conditions were analyzed by gas chromatography.
1: The capillary column used for the analysis was HP-5MS (30  m0.25  mm0.25  m) with a 5% phenyl methyl siloxane stationary phase.
2: The GC analysis was performed with the following conditions: flow rate, 0.4  ml/min; FID temperature, 275 C; make-up gas type, He with a make-up flow rate of 45  ml/min.
3: Identification of the components of the essential oils were done by comparing data with those of literature  12,   21,   22 which is based on comparison of retention times of compounds with those of available standards and with library matching of their spectra.
4: Most of the components except those in  table 1 were identified based on the information reported by Adams  22 .
5: The identification of individual components is not always possible using MS data alone; the use of chromatographic information, such as retention index, facilitates more reliable peak assignment of components in complex mixtures  23 .
