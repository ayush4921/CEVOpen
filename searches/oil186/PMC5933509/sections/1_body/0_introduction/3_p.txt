0: In this protocol, we describe methods for making synthetic thermoresponsive pre-polymers functionalized with controlled numbers of hydrazide and aldehyde groups as well as methods to apply these polymers to create hydrogels with well-defined dimensions on various length scales.
1: In particular, this manuscript describes four distinct approaches we have developed to control the mixing of the reactive hydrazide and aldehyde-functionalized pre-polymers and thus create thermoresponsive hydrogel networks with well-defined geometries and morphologies:
