0: Figure 2: Schematic of gel microparticle formation via reactive microfluidics.
1: (A,B) Hydrazide and aldehyde-functionalized polymer solutions (in water or aqueous buffer) are fed by syringe pump into separate reservoirs that are connected downstream across a zig-zag series of channels designed to create a pressure gradient preventing backflow.
2: The polymers are then mixed just before being sheared by paraffin oil flowing from both sides (also driven by a syringe pump) and forced through a nozzle, resulting in flow-focusing production of aqueous (polymer solution) droplets in a continuous paraffin oil phase (see (B) for an illustration of the nozzle area and the droplet formation process).
3: An additional two paraffin oil inlets are positioned after the nozzle to further separate the droplets in the collection channel to allow for complete gelation prior to particle removal from laminar flow, after which the resulting microparticulate gels are collected in a magnetically stirred beaker; (C) Picture of droplet generation process at the nozzle (note that hydrazide polymer is labeled as blue to illustrate mixing)
