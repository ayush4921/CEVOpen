0: Figure 4: Schematic of hydrogel nanofiber formation via reactive electrospinning.
1: A double barrel syringe with a static mixer (loaded as described for bulk hydrogels but also including a fraction of high molecular weight poly(ethylene oxide) as an electrospinning aid) is mounted on a syringe pump, with the needle at the end of the syringe connected to a high voltage power supply.
2: Hydrazone crosslinking occurs during the fiber spinning process so that when the stream hits the collector (either aluminum foil or a rotating aluminum disk) the nanofibrous morphology is maintained.
