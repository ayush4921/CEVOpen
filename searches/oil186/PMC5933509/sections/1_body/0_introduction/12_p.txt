0: The application of such methods for creating degradable smart hydrogel networks is demonstrated in this protocol using either PNIPAM or POEGMA as the polymer of interest; however, the basic approaches described can be translated to any water-soluble polymer, albeit with suitable adjustments for viscosity and (in the case of the self-assembly nanogel fabrication method) the stability of the pre-polymer in forming the seed nanoaggregate.
