0: To create degradable gel particles on the micron-scale, a reactive microfluidics method is described in which precursor polymer solutions are simultaneously mixed and emulsified using a soft lithography-templated microfluidic chip design, enabling the formation of mixed reactive polymer droplets that subsequently gel  in situ to form gel microparticles with sizes templated by the emulsion ( Figure 2) 3132.
