0: Figure 3: Schematic of nanogel formation via thermally-driven reactive self-assembly.
1: An aqueous solution containing the (thermoresponsive) hydrazide-functionalized polymer is heated above its lower critical solution temperature to create a stable uncrosslinked nanoaggregate.
2: Following, an aldehyde-functionalized polymer is added to crosslink the nanoaggregate via hydrazone bond formation and thus stabilize the nanogel particle upon cooling below the LCST.
