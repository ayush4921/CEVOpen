0: Smart materials have attracted significant attention due to their potential for reversible "on-demand" responses to external and/or environmental signals.
1: Temperature-responsive materials have attracted particular interest due to their lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior, resulting in temperature-driven precipitation at temperatures T>LCST 12.
2: In the context of thermoresponsive hydrogels, this lower critical solution temperature behavior is manifested by reversible swelling/de-swelling events that result in temperature-tunable bulk sizes (larger at T<LCST) 3, pore sizes (larger at T<LCST) 4, and interfacial properties (more hydrophilic at T<LCST) 5.
3: Such transitions have been widely applied in drug delivery (for external or environmentally-triggerable drug release 467), tissue engineering and cell culture (for thermoreversible cell adhesion/delamination 8910), separations (for switchable membrane porosities and permeabilities or thermally-recyclable diagnostic supports 111213), microfluidic processes (for on-off valves regulating flow 1415), and rheological modifiers (for temperature-tunable viscosities 16).
4: The most commonly investigated thermoresponsive hydrogels are based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) 17, although significant (and increasing) work has also been conducted on poly(oligoethylene glycol methacrylate) (POEGMA) 218 and poly(vinylcaprolactam) (PVCL) 1920.
5: POEGMA has attracted particular recent interest given its anticipated improved biocompatibility 2122and its facile-to-tune LCST behavior, in which linearly-predictable mixtures of monomers with different numbers of ethylene oxide repeat units in their side chains can alter the LCST from ~20 C to >90 C 223.
6: However, each of these polymers is prepared by free radical polymerization and thus contains a carbon-carbon backbone, significantly limiting the potential utility and translatability of such polymers in the context of biomedical applications in which degradation (or at least the capacity for clearance through renal filtration) is typically a requirement.
