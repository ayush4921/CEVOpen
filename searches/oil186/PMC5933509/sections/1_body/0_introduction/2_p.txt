0: In response to this limitation, we have recently reported extensively on the application of hydrazone chemistry ( i.e., the reaction between hydrazide and aldehyde-functionalized pre-polymers) to prepare degradable analogues of thermoresponsive hydrogels 242526272829.
1: The rapid and reversible reaction between hydrazide and aldehyde groups upon mixing of the functionalized precursor polymers 30 enables both  in situ gelation (enabling facile injection of these materials without the need for surgical implantation or any type of external polymerization stimulus such as UV irradiation or chemical initiation) as well as hydrolytic degradation of the network at a rate controlled by the chemistry and density of the crosslinking sites.
2: Furthermore, by maintaining the molecular weight of the pre-polymers used to prepare the hydrogels below the renal filtration limit, hydrogels made using this approach degrade back into the oligomeric precursor polymers that can be cleared from the body 252728.
3: Coupled with the low cytotoxicity and low inflammatory tissue response induced by these materials 252627, this approach offers a potentially translatable method for the use of thermoresponsive smart hydrogels in medicine, particularly if well-controlled degradable analogues of such hydrogels on all length scales (bulk, micro, and nano) can be fabricated.
