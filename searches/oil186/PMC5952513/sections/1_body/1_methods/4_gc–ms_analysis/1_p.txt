0: The oils were quantitatively and qualitatively analysed using a GCMS 6890-5975 system (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a HP-5 MS fused silica capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 m film thickness).
1: For GCMS detection, an electron ionization system with ionization energy of 70 eV was used.
2: Helium gas (1 mL/min) was used as carrier gas.
3: Injector and mass transfer line temperatures were set at 250 and 280 C, respectively.
4: EO solution (1 L) in hexane was injected and analysed under the following column conditions: initial column temperature at 40 C for 1 min, increased to 250 C at a 3 C/min heating ramp, and maintained at 250 C for 20 min.
5: Kovats indices were calculated for all of the volatile components by using a homologous series of  n-alkanes (C 8C 25) in an HP-5 MS column.
6: The major oil components were identified by co-injection with standards (whenever possible) and confirmed using the Wiley (V.7.0) and National Institute of Standards and Technology V.2.0 GCMS library on the basis of Kovats indices.
7: The relative concentration of each compound in the oil was quantified on the basis of the peak area integrated in the analysis program.
