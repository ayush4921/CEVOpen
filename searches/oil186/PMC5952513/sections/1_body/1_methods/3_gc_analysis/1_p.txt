0: An Agilent HP-6890 gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) with a HP-5 5% phenylmethylsiloxane capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 m film thickness) and an FID detector was used for GCFID analysis.
1: Helium gas (1 mL/min) was used as the carrier gas.
2: Injector and mass transfer line temperatures were set at 250 and 280 C, respectively.
3: The EO solution (1 L) in hexane was injected and analysed under the following column conditions: initial column temperature of 40 C for 1 min, increased to 250 C at a 3 C/min, and maintained at 250 C for 20 min.
