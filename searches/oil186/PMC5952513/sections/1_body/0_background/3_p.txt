0: Generally, mosquito larval control is carried out by conventional synthetic insecticides, which have high efficiency and low cost.
1: Their efficacy may decay gradually because mosquitoes develop resistance against insecticides [ 9].
2: By contrast, plant essential oils, often obtained from the plant by steam distillation or hydrodistillation, constitute a rich source of bioactive compounds [ 10], and have emerged as a good alternative larvicidal or adulticidal agents with fewer insect resistance problems [ 11].
3: Biodegradable and nontoxic, they can be used as an eco-friendly tool as well as an economical agent in vector control [ 12].
