0: Among mosquitoes,  Anopheles is the only vector of human malaria [ 4] and, of these, 3040 species commonly transmit parasites of the genus  Plasmodium [ 5].
1: Anopheles anthropophagus and  Anopheles sinensis have been chosen as the test target mosquito species in this research, because they are rife and harmful in China.
2: The mosquito  An.
3: sinensis is a member of the  Anopheles hyrcanus group, distinguished from other series by the presence of pale bands (usually four) on the palpi and a tuft of dark scales on the clypeus on each side.
4: Anopheles anthropophagus is a major vector in central China, able to spread malaria 1820 times better than  An.
5: sinensis [ 6,  7].
6: The larvae of  An.
7: anthropophagus and  An.
8: sinensis live on the surface of water.
9: Compared to adults, the ability of larvae to escape the insecticide is limited, so the time from larvae to adult is an important period to control mosquitoes [ 8].
