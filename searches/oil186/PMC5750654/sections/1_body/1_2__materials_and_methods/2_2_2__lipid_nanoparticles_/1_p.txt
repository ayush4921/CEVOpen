0: Unloaded SLNs and EO-loaded NLCs, whose composition is reported in  Table 1, were prepared using the phase inversion temperature (PIT) method [ 27].
1: The aqueous phase (double distilled water containing 0.35% ( w/ w) imidazolidinyl urea and 0.05% ( w/ w) methylchloroisothiazolinone and methylisothiazolinone as preservatives) and the oil phase (cetyl palmitate, emulsifier and co-emulsifier, different percentages  w/ w of EO) were separately heated at 85 C. Two series of NLCs were prepared: NLCs BEO14 were obtained using a constant amount of lipid phase (7%  w/ w) with different ratios solid lipid/liquid lipid, while NLCs CEO13 contained a constant amount of solid lipid (7%  w/ w) and different percentages of liquid lipid.
