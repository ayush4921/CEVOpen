0: When both phases were at the same temperature, the water phase was slowly added to the oil phase while being stirred and then the resulting colloidal system was cooled to room temperature, under constant agitation.
1: The turbid mixture turned into a clear system at the phase inversion temperature (PIT), whose value was determined using a conductivity meter, model 525 (Crison, Modena, Italy).
