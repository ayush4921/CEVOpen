0: Measurements of skin hydration and elasticity were performed at baseline (prior to the treatment) and after one week of treatment.
1: Measurements were taken under controlled temperature (22  1 C) and humidity (35  5%) conditions, after 30 min of acclimatization.
2: The volunteers were requested not to apply the gels the morning before the final measurement.
3: The use of other products was not allowed throughout the study, apart from normal hygiene treatment.
4: Skin analyses were performed using specific probes of the instrument Soft Plus (Callegari Srl, Parma, Italy).
5: These probes determined skin hydration by capacity measurements in the range 0100 u.c.
6: (arbitrary units) with a resolution of 1 u.c.
7: and 5% precision, while stress/deformation of skin by suction application allowed measurements of skin elasticity in the range 050 u.c.
8: with a resolution of 1 u.c.
9: and 10% precision.
10: Each measurement was performed in triplicate.
