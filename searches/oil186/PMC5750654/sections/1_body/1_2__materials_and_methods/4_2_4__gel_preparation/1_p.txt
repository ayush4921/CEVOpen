0: Gel formulations were prepared using Carbopol Ultrez 21 as a gelling agent and TEA for neutralization, and their compositions are reported in  Table 2.
1: The rheological additive (0.8%  w/ w) was carefully dispersed in the aqueous phase, under mild agitation.
2: The aqueous phase consisted of deionized water (gel A), deionized water containing EO and Solubilisant Gamma 2428 (gel B and B1), SLN A (gel C), NLC CEO3 (gel D and D1).
3: As rosemary essential oil was poorly water soluble, we added a solubilizing compound to obtain aqueous gels containing different percentages of EO.
4: All gel formulations were prepared using deionized water containing 0.35%  w/ w imidazolidinyl urea, 0.05%  w/ w methylchloroisothiazolinone and methylisothiazolinone as preservatives.
5: The resulting mixture was left in the dark at room temperature for 24 h, to allow complete polymer hydration.
6: Then, TEA (0.8%  w/ w) was added drop by drop under slow agitation, to prevent the formation of air bubbles, until the gel was formed.
7: All formulations were stored in airtight jars, and kept in the dark and at room temperature until use.
