0: For negative-staining electron microscopy, 5 L of lipid nanocarriers dispersions were placed on a 200-mesh formvar copper grid (TAAB Laboratories Equipment, Berks, UK) and allowed to be adsorbed.
1: Then the surplus was removed by filter paper.
2: A drop of 2% ( w/ v) aqueous solution of uranyl acetate was added over 2 min.
3: After removing the surplus, the sample was dried at room temperature before imaging it with a transmission electron microscope (model JEM 2010, Jeol, Peabody, MA, USA) operating at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.
