0: All the samples were diluted at 1:5 (sample/water) and thermostated at 25 C for 2 min prior to the measurement.
1: The instrument performed particle sizing by means of a 4 mW laser diode operating at 670 nm.
2: Using the same instrument,  potential was determined by the technique of laser Doppler velocimetry, after diluting the sample with KCl 1 mM (pH 7.0), according to a procedure already reported [ 28].
