0: Advantages, including the ability to incorporate lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs, controlled drug release, drug targeting, increased drug stability and bioavailability, safety, easy scale-up and low cost of production, have boosted the use of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) as nanocarriers for different administration routes [ 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17].
1: Recent investigations have revealed the usefulness of SLNs as carriers for EO delivery.
2: EOs from the genera  Boswellia and  Commiphora, exhibiting antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor activities, were efficiently loaded into SLNs designed for oral delivery, providing increased anticancer activity compared to free EOs [ 18].
3: Moghimipour et al.
4: [ 19] prepared SLNs encapsulating the essential oil extracted from the leaves of  Zataria multiflora and concluded that SLNs are suitable carriers for essential oils.
5: The same conclusion was reported in a study assessing SLNs loaded with  Nigella sativa essential oil [ 20].
6: Two different SLN formulations were investigated in vitro as carriers for the topical and transdermal delivery of  Artemisia arborescens essential oil [ 21].
7: This study pointed out the high physical stability of these formulations, along with their ability to target the essential oil to the skin layers, while retaining in vitro antiviral activity.
