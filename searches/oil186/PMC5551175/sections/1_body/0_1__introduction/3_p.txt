0: As for other neglected tropical diseases, the chemotherapeutical arsenal against HAT is based on limited, expensive, and often toxic medicines that are administered parentally in a context of poverty and a lack of qualified personnel in healthcare centers.
1: The few drugs that are available are pentamidine and suramin for the early stage of the disease and eflornithine (also in combination with nifurtimox) and melarsoprol, an organoarsenic compound, for the late stage, when the parasite infects the brain.
2: Although melarsoprol can cause severe reactive encephalopathy, it remains a first line treatment for infections by  T. b. gambiense in many rural areas because of the high cost of eflornithine [ 1].
3: Overall, the scenario described above highlights the critical nature of the current situation and the urgent need to explore new sources of potentially effective and safe compounds for therapy.
