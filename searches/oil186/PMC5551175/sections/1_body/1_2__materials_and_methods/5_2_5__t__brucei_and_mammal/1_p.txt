0: The cell culture conditions and the growth inhibition assay on  T. brucei and Balb/3T3 cells were performed as described before [ 44].
1: T. brucei TC221 bloodstream forms and mouse embryonic fibroblast Balb/3T3 cells (ATCC no CCL-163) were cultivated in vented plastic flasks at 37 C with 5% CO 2.
2: For  T. brucei, the growth medium was HMI-9 [ 45] supplemented with 10% ( v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Waltham, MA, USA), whereas the Balb/3T3 cells were grown in Dulbeccos Modified Eagles Medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% ( v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, glutamine (0.584 g/L), and 10 mL/L 100 penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco).
