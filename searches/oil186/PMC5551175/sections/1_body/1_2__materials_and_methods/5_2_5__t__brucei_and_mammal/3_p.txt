0: The plates were incubated for 48 h in the CO 2 incubator; then 20 L of 0.5 mM resazurine (Sigma Aldrich) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for an additional 24 h before the fluorescence was measured with an Infinite M200 microplate reader (Tecan group, Ltd., Mannedorf, Switzerland) equipped with 540 and 590 nm excitation and emission filters.
1: The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) values were calculated on a log inhibitor versus the response curves by non-linear regression using the GraphPad prism 5.04 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).
