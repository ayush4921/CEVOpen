0: The chemical constituents of the Cameroonian essential oils were analyzed on an Agilent 6890 N gas chromatograph coupled to a 5973 N mass spectrometer (Santa Clara, CA, USA) and equipped with a HP-5 MS capillary column (5% phenylmethylpolysiloxane, 30 m, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.1 m film thickness; J & W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA).
1: For the separation of the volatile constituents, the following temperature program was used: 5 min at 60 C then 4 C/min up to 220 C, then 11 C/min up to 280 C held for 15 min.
2: The injector and detector temperatures were: 280 C; carrier gas: Helium; flow rate: 1 mL/min; split ratio: 1:50; acquisition mass range: 29400  m/z; and mode: electron-impact (EI, 70 eV).
3: The essential oil was diluted 1:100 in  n-hexane, and then 2 L of the solution was injected into the GC-MS system.
4: For the identification of essential oil components, co-injection with the authentic standards available in our laboratory (purchased from Sigma-Aldrich) was performed, together with a comparison of the retention indices and the mass spectra of those occurring in the ADAMS, NIST 08, and FFNSC2 libraries [ 41, 42, 43].
5: The percentage values of the volatile components were the means of three chromatographic analyses and were determined from the peak areas without the use of correction factors.
