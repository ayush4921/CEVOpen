2: Fruits (pods) of  A. melegueta were collected in a forest near Foumbam (western Cameroon) in December 2015.
3: Once harvested, the seeds were removed from their pods and dried at room temperature over a period of three weeks in the absence of sunlight.
4: At the end of the drying process, the seeds were placed into paper bags before hydrodistillation.

8: These plant parts were dried at room temperature for one week.
9: The botanical identification of the five species was performed by a taxonomist at the Cameroon National Herbarium (Yaounde, Cameroon), and the voucher specimens were archived with the following codes: 4447 SRFK ( A. indica), 43117 HNC ( A. melegueta), 43130 HNC ( A. danielli), 44242/HNC ( C. anisata), 42920 HNC ( D. cinerea), and 23647 SRF ( E. giganteus).
