0: A. schaueriana Stapf & Leechm ex.
1: Moldenke, also called black mangrove or siriuba, is one of the native Brazilian mangrove species.
2: The antimicrobial activity of  A. schaueriana extracts has been reported [ 2, 8].
3: However, essential oils from this species have never been evaluated for its chemical composition or biological activities.
4: In the genus, only the  A. marina leaf and fruit oils have been analyzed, presenting 2,6-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-methylphenol (BHT) (41.91%) and 2-phenyl-1,3-butadiene (24.56%) as major components for the leaf oils, and methyl palmitate (41.9%), methyl  p-vinylbenzoate (9.68%) and methyl ester ( 9Z,15 Z)-9,15-octadecadienoic acid (8.28%) for the fruit oils [ 12, 13].
5: Hence, this study aims to evaluate the composition of leaf essential oils from two  A. schaueriana specimens and to compare their in vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activities.
