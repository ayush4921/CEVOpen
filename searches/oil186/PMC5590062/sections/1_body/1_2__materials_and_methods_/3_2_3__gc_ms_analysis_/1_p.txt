0: Qualitative analysis of essential oils from the leaves of  A. schacueriana collected at Parque Estadual da Ilha do Cardoso and Estacao Ecologica da Jureia-Itatins were performed in an Agilent6890 Series GC (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) interfaced with a 5973 series quadrupole MS detector (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), equipped with a DB-5 column (30 m  0.25 mm i.d.
1: 0.25 m) (Agilent J&W, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
2: Chromatography conditions were as follows; over temperature: initially held at 40 C for 1 min and subsequently increased to 240 C at 3 C/min; carrier gas: He at a flow rate of 1 mL/min; injector and detector temperature: 250 C, electron ionization: 70 eV.
3: The components were identified by comparing retention indices (evaluated in relation to the retention times of a series of  n-alkanes) and mass spectra with those reported in the literature [ 14, 15].
