0: The antioxidant activity of the essential oils was evaluated by the 2.2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl hydrate (DPPH) radical scavenging method.
1: The essential oil solubilized in methanol at concentrations between 43513.60 g/mL in a microplate well (sample), pure methanol (blank), and DPPH solution (202.88 mol, control) were transferred to a 96-well microplate (Corning, New York, NY, USA).
2: The sample solubilized in methanol without DPPH was used as a blank sample.
3: The plate was incubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature.
4: Then, the absorbance was read at the wavelength of 520 nm, using a multi-well scanning spectrophotometer (Synergy HT Biotek, Winooski, VT, USA).
5: The radical scavenging capacity (expressed as percentage) was calculated as the rate between [(Abs control  Abs blank)  (Abs sample  Abs blank sample)/(Abs control  Abs blank)]  100.
6: Quercetin was employed as a positive control.
7: The amount of extract required to reduce the initial DPPH concentration in the reaction by 50% is referred to as the inhibitory concentration (IC 50).
8: The data were compared by one-way Anova, followed by Tukeys test, representing the mean and confidence interval (CI 95) for  n = 3.
9: The results were considered statistically different when  p< 0.05.
