0: Antifungal activity was assessed against  Aspergillus brasiliensis (ATCC 16404) and  Candida albicans (ATCC 10231), and antibacterial activity was evaluated against one model of Gram-positive bacteria,  Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538), and two models of Gram-negative bacteria,  Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027) and  Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739).
1: Microdilution in broth was the method used to determine the antimicrobial activity.
2: The growth inhibitions were determined by broth microdilution method according to the protocols of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [ 16, 17].
3: Microorganisms were incubated for 48 h at 28 C on SDA (for the yeast and fungi) or for 24 h at 37 C on TSA (for the bacteria).
4: Following incubation, a suspension of the microorganism was prepared and standardized in saline solution (0.9%) for subsequent inoculation into liquid culture medium (SDB for the yeast and fungi; TSB for the bacteria) to give a final concentration of 2  10 3 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL in each well of the microplate.
5: Samples of the essential oil of each plant collected were diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide:methanol 1:1 ( v/ v) to give a final concentration of 217 g/mL in each microplate well.
6: After incubation, the growth inhibition was measured by reading the absorbance at a wavelength of 630 nm, using a multi-well scanning spectrophotometer (Synergy HT Biotek, Winooski, VT, USA); except for  A. brasiliensis, where the growth was evaluated only visually.
7: Growth inhibitions (%) were determined for samples that inhibited the growth of the microorganism in the microplate well test.
