0: The oil analysis was carried on a GC7890N AGILENT & MS 5975 (EI mass detector), in the following conditions: chromatography was achieved using a (5%-phenyl)-methyl polysiloxane HP-5MS column (30 m  0.25 mm, 0.25 mm film thickness) with a helium carrier gas, adjusted to a linear velocity of 1 ml/min.
1: the column was with a 50:1 split ratio.
2: The injector temperature was regulated at 260 C. also, The column oven temperature was maintained at 60 C for 4 min and programmed to 100 C at 3 C/min for 2 min and then to 250 C at 6 C/min for 6 min; electron energy at 70 eV.
3: Positive ions were observed while the analyzer was scanned from mass 50 to 550.
4: The Kovats indices were determined for all volatile constituents using a mixture of homologous series of n-alkanes C9C23 on HP-5MS column.
5: The components were identified by comparison of their mass spectra with those of the NIST 5 mass spectra library.
6: The Kovats indices were calculated using by following formula ( 25).
