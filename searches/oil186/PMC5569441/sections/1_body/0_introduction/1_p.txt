0: Depression is a major chronic psychiatric dis-order affecting nearly 21% of the world population and imposes a substantial health burden on the society ( 1).
1: People with a depressed mood are characterized by despair, loss of interest in daily working and social relationship, sadness, anxiety, hopelessness, helplessness, and guilt ( 2).
2: There are three main kinds of classical antidepressants in clinical practice, including tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and desipramine), selec-tive serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) including moclobemide and tranylcypromine.
3: Although approved antidepre-ssant drugs are effective, a significant number of people do not efficiently respond.
4: In addition, these drugs are accompanied with many adverse effects ( 3,  4).
5: Accordingly, there is a need for the development of new drugs with more efficacies and less adverse effects.
6: Natural products displaying antidepressant effects are of great interest and may be important sources of new antidepressant drugs ( 5,  6).
