0: The 16S rRNA gene has been applied to study the diversity of bacterial communities via cultivation, cloning, T-RFLP, and other traditional microbiological approaches.
1: While the information generated from these approaches can preliminarily illustrate the composition of bacterial communities, their application has been restricted by limited information, high cost, and omission of rare biospheres.
2: The NGS techniques, e.g., Roche's 454 GS20 pyrosequencing (Margulies et al.,  2005), Illumina Hiseq/Miseq sequencing (Bennett,  2004), ion torrent sequencing (Rothberg et al.,  2011), and single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing (Eid et al.,  2009), allowed the generation of massive data sets at a much lower cost (Medini et al.,  2008; Armougom and Raoult,  2009; Klindworth et al.,  2013).
