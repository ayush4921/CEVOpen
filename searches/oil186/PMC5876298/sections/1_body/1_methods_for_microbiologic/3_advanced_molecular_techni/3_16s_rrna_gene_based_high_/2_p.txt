0: The DWH oil spill occurred in 2010, when the use of high-throughput sequencing was on the rise.
1: The new techniques of microbial ecology were comprehensively applied after the event to reveal the impacts of the oil spill on bacterial communities and the responses of different bacterial phyla (Gutierrez,  2011).
2: 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was the first NGS technique applied in this event (Blum et al.,  2012), providing information on the succession of bacterial communities.
3: The results, based on the NGS data, specifically showed the increase in the bacterial phyla  Colwelliaceae and  Oceanospirillales, which was consistent with the results from 16S rRNA gene-based clone library and PhyloChip (Hazen et al.,  2010; Redmond and Valentine,  2011).
4: The results were based on the analysis of 148,276 quality-filtered reads from 16 samples, whereas the first study after the spill which applied 16S rRNA gene based clone library only generated 250 high qualitied sequences from three samples (Hazen et al.,  2010).
5: The great amount of sequencing could produce more useful information for revealing the bacterial responses to the oil spill.
6: Illumina sequencing was also used in later studies (Mason et al.,  2012,  2014b; Simister et al.,  2016).
7: For instance, by analyzing massive amounts of data generated by Illumina sequencing, Simister et al.
8: ( 2016) found that the dominant bacteria in both sediment and floc samples were  Proteobacteria (5564%).
9: They also found that the bacterial composition of the floc samples (mostly aerobic or facultative aerobic phylotypes including  Rhizobiales, Rhodobacterales, Sphingomonadales, Rickettsiales, Alteromonadales, and  Pseudomonadales) was different from those in the sediment samples (aforementioned aerobic species and anaerobic phylotypes such as  Desulfobacterales, Desulfuromonadales, and  Desulfarculales).
