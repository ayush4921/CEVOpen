0: Traditional approaches applied in ecological microbiology have promoted developments in this field for decades and have provided general information on the existence (FISH), composition (Clone Library, DGGE/TGGE, FISH, and T-RTLP), and abundance (Clone Library and RT-qPCR) of microbes.
1: Nevertheless, the information generated by these approaches is finite, and the unit cost (the cost per sequence) is relatively expensive.
2: For instance, only dozens of DGGE bands or clones could be identified by combining the techniques of DGGE and clone libraries which could only generate limited information and hardly reflected on the real composition of bacterial communities.
3: Furthermore, the unit cost for a single sequence can be much higher by Sanger sequencing than NGS.
4: With the development of new approaches, such as DNA/RNA microarrays, NGS, and SIP, ecological microbiology research is faced with new opportunities.
5: These currently prevalent techniques can generate massive data sets for detailed investigation on the composition and diversity of bacterial communities in different habitats or following particular events.
6: Some new techniques that provide impressive information have been used in investigating the succession and function of the microbial communities after the DWH oil spill.
