0: A single chip can be used to analyze thousands of genes in one assay.
1: Therefore, microarrays are becoming one of the major culture-independent identification/quantification methods.
2: However, the microarray technique faces the challenges of natural sequence diversity and potential cross-hybridization in complex environmental bioaerosols (Li and Huang,  2006).
3: Lack of a probe sequence and the complexity of the gene chip's interactive hybridization have been shown to induce low specificity and poor sensitivity of experimental results (Zhou and Thompson,  2002; Gentry et al.,  2006).
