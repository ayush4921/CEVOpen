0: Both PhyloChip and GeoChip were applied to investigate the succession of bacterial communities and reveal the functional genes in the biodegradation of oil pollution during the DWH oil spill (Bodrossy et al.,  2003; Hazen et al.,  2010; Beazley et al.,  2012).
1: The PhyloChip analysis of 16S rRNA microarray conducted by Hazen et al.
2: ( 2010) suggested that the oil plume significantly altered the microbial community composition and structure.
3: In addition, the functional gene-based GeoChip microarray analysis revealed significant increases in the expression of more than 1,600 genes involved in hydrocarbon degradation (BTEX, alkane, cycloalkanes, and PAH) compared to the background non-plume samples (Hazen et al.,  2010).
4: In another study, the microbial communities in the Gulf of Mexico's coastal marshes during and after the oil spill were determined via both GeoChip and PhyloChip (Beazley et al.,  2012).
5: A total of 12,018 operation taxonomy units (OTUs) were successfully identified by PhyloChip microarray-based analysis, and the result demonstrated that bacterial phyla with potential genes for oil degradation exhibited significant increases after the oil spill.
6: For instance, bacterial phyla affiliated to  Actinomycetaceae, Dietziaceae, Nocardioidaceae, Erythrobacteraceae, and others, which have been shown to be capable of degrading alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), dramatically increased during the oil infiltration of sediments.
7: In contrast, bacterial phyla of  Verrucomicrobia, Cyanobacteria, and  Planctomycete showed obvious decreases due to their relatively low tolerance to oil pollution.
8: GeoChip microarray-based analysis was used to identify 16,383 unique functional genes.
9: The results indicated that a relative abundance of functional genes involved in hydrocarbon degradation (e.g.,  alkB, alkH, phaB, dsrA/B, and others) were significantly increased between June and July in the inlet sediments (Beazley et al.,  2012).
