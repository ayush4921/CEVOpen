0: DNA microarrays are collections of microscopic DNA spots, representing single target genes, that are attached to a chemical matrix and arrayed on a solid surface.
1: By DNA-DNA or DNA-RNA hybridization, DNA microarrays can provide qualitative or quantitative measurements of microbial diversity and functional gene expression (Loy et al.,  2002; Bodrossy et al.,  2003).
2: This method has been used for nearly 20 years and has experienced several generations of improvement.
3: By hybridizing target genes with probes attached to a specific microchip, DNA microarrays can provide a deep understanding of indigenous microbial communities because of its advantages of specificity, sensitivity, quantitative analysis, and high-throughput methods (Gentry et al.,  2006).
4: Two different DNA microarray methods (PhyloChip and GeoChip) have been extensively used in the field of environmental microbiology.
5: PhyloChip can be used to analyze the diversity of microbial communities, while the GeoChip method can be used to study the activity of functional microbes by targeting functional genes.
6: These two different microarrays can be used together to study and compare microbial communities from different treatments or environments.
