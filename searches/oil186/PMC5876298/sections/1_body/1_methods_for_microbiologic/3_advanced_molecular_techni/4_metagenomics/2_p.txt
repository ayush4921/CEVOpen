0: Before NGS became prevalent, metagenomic analysis based on shotgun sequencing data was constrained by the limited data on individual genomes and environmental genetic data.
1: The high-throughput, short runtime, and low-cost attributes of NGS have altered our overview of microbial metagenomics (Scholz et al.,  2012).
2: By applying metagenomic analysis, (Mason et al.
3: ( 2012,  2014b)) investigated the responses of bacterial communities in deep sea oil plumes and sediment.
4: Metagenomic data from these two studies demonstrated that the indigenous microbiota contributed an important ecosystem service of oil remediation in the Gulf of Mexico.
5: Functional genes encoding for the degradation of aliphatic and simple aromatics hydrocarbon were significantly enriched after the oil spill.
6: Nevertheless, no dramatic changes were found in the abundance of genes involved in the degradation of PAHs.
7: This indicated that recalcitrant compounds could not be actively degraded at the sampling time and that these compounds might need a longer period for biodegradation.
8: Another study based on metagenomic analysis found that a greater number of  -proteobacteria and anaerobic functional genes were present in sediments closer to the DWH blowout site, which indicated that  -proteobacteria might play a dominant role in anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation (Kimes et al.,  2013).
