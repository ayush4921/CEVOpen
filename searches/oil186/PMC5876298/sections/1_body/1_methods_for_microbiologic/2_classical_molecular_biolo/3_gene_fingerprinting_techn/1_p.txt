0: Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) are two commonly used gene fingerprinting techniques that separate different DNA/RNA in the same sample via chemical or temperature gradients.
1: Muyzer et al.
2: ( 1993) first introduced DGGE into the field of microbial ecology to describe the composition of bacterial communities.
3: Different bands on the gel indicate different bacterial phylotypes and band intensity shows the relative abundance of certain bacterial taxa.
4: By cutting DGGE/TGGE strips, building clone libraries, and sequencing, the information related to a band can be further interpreted.
5: Although the information provided by these two techniques are thought to be insufficient (as there are always dozens of bands for one sample) and NGS can generate more data, DGGE/TGGE techniques are still widely used to study microbial communities as they can intuitively display the differences between different samples via gel profiles within short time periods (12 d for an experimental cycle).
