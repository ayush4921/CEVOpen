0: Like DGGE/TGGE, TRFLP, or sometimes T-RLP is another gene fingerprinting technique.
1: By generating a fingerprint for pattern comparison and then complementing the data with a clone library, resolving peaks using a database, and performing multivariate analysis, TRFLP can reveal the differences in unknown microbial communities in various environmental samples (Liu et al.,  1997).
2: T-RFLP was applied to investigate the composition and succession of bacterial communities after the oil spill and successfully revealed the relatively higher contribution of the bacterial group  Flavobacteria, which is a secondary consumer of methane, oil, or cellular decay products (Redmond and Valentine,  2011).
3: Profiles generated by TRFLP indicated that up to 56% of the total bacteria in plume samples collected in September 2010 were affiliated with  Flavobacteria, whereas this number was only 1030% when 16S rRNA gene-based clone library techniques were applied (Redmond and Valentine,  2011).
4: In a recent study, the TRFLP analysis for community composition of ammonia oxidizers in salt marshes after the DWH oil spill revealed that exposure to oil, even 2 years post-spill, could contribute to subtle changes in population dynamics of bacterial communities (Bernhard et al.,  2016).
5: Although T-RFLP could provide more authentic data compared to clone libraries, it could still underestimate community diversity, especially when complex and large amounts of data were applied.
6: In the abovementioned study (Redmond and Valentine,  2011), some terminal restriction fragments could be assigned to multiple groups.
7: Due to the significant overlaps between the  methanotrophs, methylotrophs, and some other - proteobacteria, it was not possible to distinguish the - proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and SAR406 clades from each other.
8: Nevertheless, some groups, such as  Flavobacteria, - proteobacteria, and - proteobacteria could be readily differentiated.
