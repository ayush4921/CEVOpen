0: After the DWH oil spills, DGGE provided some of the first information on naturally occurring microbial communities in the sediment from shorelines along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico (Lisle,  2011).
1: Some active bacterial species exhibited increases in biomass during the degradation process.
2: Bacosa et al.
3: ( 2015a) used 16S rRNA gene-based DGGE to detect microbial community dynamics and composition with the stressor of Light Louisiana Sweet (LLS) crude oil under dark and natural light conditions.
4: The results demonstrated that different bacterial groups were involved in the degradation of n-alkane under the dark and light conditions.
