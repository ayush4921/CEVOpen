0: In addition to the aforementioned molecular methods, other molecular tools were also used to study indigenous microbial communities, such as FISH and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).
1: The FISH method has been widely used to investigate composition of bacterial communities in recent years.
2: It can provide fluorescent images indicating the existence and relative abundance of target genes combing with special fluorescent probes.
3: 16S rRNA genes or functional genes can be detected by this approach without PCR amplification (DeLong et al.,  1989; Amann and Fuchs,  2008).
4: Catalyzed reporter deposition in combination with FISH (CARDFISH) were performed to detect the microbial aggregate formations in a microcosm study using deep plume seawater with addition of nutrients (Kleindienst et al.,  2015).
5: The results revealed that the potential dispersant-degrader,  Colwellia was one of the dominant bacterial phylotypes in microaggregate which indicated that this bacterial group could play an important role in marine oil snow formation.
6: By developing two new 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes (Mrb-0625-aandMrb-0625-b) for the FISH assay, McKay et al.
7: ( 2016) successfully monitored the rapid increase of the oil-degrading bacterium,  Marinobacter, after amending n-hexadecane in an enrichment experiment with a deep-sea oil plume water sample.
8: Compared to FISH, qPCR can quantify targeted functional bacterial phyla more accurately.
9: It provides relatively accurate data via real-time monitoring of the fluorescent signals generated by fluorescent probes (Heo et al.,  2010; Yuan et al.,  2010).
10: Because probes and primes are necessary for both FISH and RT-qPCR detection, only bacterial phylotypes with probes/primers can be detected and quantified, whereas some unknown groups without specific probes/primers are difficult to be detected using these methods.
