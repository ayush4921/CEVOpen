0: The 16S rRNA gene is well-known as a marker gene for the reconstruction of prokaryotic (bacterial and archaeal) phylogenies and for the investigation of microbial diversity (Woese and Fox,  1977; Klindworth et al.,  2013).
1: The construction of clone libraries based on 16S rRNA genes has extensively been used to investigate bacterial communities until the advent of next generation sequencing (NGS).
2: 16S rRNA gene-based clone library analysis provides a useful, though somewhat limited, tool for capturing the diversity and composition of bacterial communities (Kumar et al.,  2007; Schafer et al.,  2010).
3: In the literature on the DWH oil spill, 16S rRNA gene-based clone library analysis was one of the most popular techniques for investigating microbial communities.
4: Several studies using 16S rRNA gene clone libraries revealed the microbial community responses to the contamination caused by the deep-sea plumes of hydrocarbons.
5: These communities exhibited significant differences in different habitats (plume and non-plume water, surface and deep-sea water, sediments, and beach sands; see Table  1) and presented dramatic changes over the duration of the spill (Hazen et al.,  2010; Valentine et al.,  2010; Kessler et al.,  2011; Redmond and Valentine,  2011; Yang et al.,  2016).
6: For instance, Hazen et al.
7: ( 2010) identified members of the order  Oceanospirillales in the  -Proteobacteria class as dominant in deep-sea plumes.
8: Oceanospirillales were not detected in most of the plume samples in June, while  Cycloclasticus and  Colwellia were dominant (more than 95% of the sequences).
9: This indicates that the DWH  Oceanospirillales bloomed initially, followed by  Colwellia and  Cycloclasticus (Redmond and Valentine,  2011; Yang et al.,  2016).
