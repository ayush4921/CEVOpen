0: Traditional methods, such as isolation and purification of bacterial strains from various environments are essential as exemplified in microbiological studies of the DWH spill.
1: The isolation of microbes in pure culture can provide valuable information on the functions, metabolic pathways, and physiological characteristics of bacteria that respond to an oil spill.
2: During the DWH spill, different bacterial strains (e.g.,  Alcanivorax, Alteromonas, Cycloclasticus, Halomonas, Marinobacter, and  Pseudoalteromonas) with hydrocarbon-degrading abilities were isolated from surface slicks and deep oil plumes (Gutierrez et al.,  2013).
3: With the addition of oil (or the oil dispersant Corexit) as the sole carbon source, Blum et al.
4: ( 2012) successfully isolated one hydrocarbon-degrading strain (belonging to the family  Colwelliaceae), which were the dominant microorganism in the oil plume.
