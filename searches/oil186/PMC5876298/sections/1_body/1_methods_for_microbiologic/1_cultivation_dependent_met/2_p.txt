0: Despite the successful isolation of some oil-degrading bacteria, most of the indigenous bacterial strains could not be isolated by conventional culture-based methods.
1: This might be attributed to the fact that artificial culture conditions are different from the  in situ environment, due to the absence of symbiotic organisms and specific nutrient levels (Zengler et al.,  2002).
2: Furthermore, specific environmental conditions in deep sea (low temperature, O 2 restriction and hydrostatic pressure) are always neglected or difficult to setup in the  ex situ experiments, which limit the isolation of oil-degrading bacteria (Scoma et al.,  2016).
3: Recently, some previously uncultured microorganisms were successively grown in pure culture using newly-developed culturing techniques, including (1) supplying various chemical compounds found in their natural environment (Kaeberlein et al.,  2002; Rappe et al.,  2002; Zengler et al.,  2002); (2) lengthening the period of incubation and protecting cells from exogenous peroxides (Stevenson et al.,  2004); (3) isolating uncultived microorganisms in a simulated natural environment with specific devices (Kaeberlein et al.,  2002); (4) high-throughput dilution to extinction culturing technology (HTC) (Rappe et al.,  2002; Stingl et al.,  2007).
4: The above microbiological cultivating technologies have not been used to isolate bacteria from the DWH oil spill-contaminated environment, and could be considered in microbiological investigations of future oil spills.
5: Considering the particularity of the deep-sea environment, the method based on the simulated/real natural environment (Kaeberlein et al.,  2002) can be applied in future studies.
6: Briefly, surface sediments with  in situ microorganism can be mixed with warmed agar and sealed in a diffusion chamber sealed by two membranes which not only allow exchange of chemicals between the chamber and the environment, but also restrict the movement of cells.
7: The sealed chambers can be cultivated in a marine aquarium with simulated natural environment (low temperature, O 2 restriction and hydrostatic pressure) or  in situ in the deep-sea environment.
8: The development of novel cultivating technologies to isolate previously uncultured bacteria could permit a more comprehensive understanding of unexplored bacterial communities, including their metabolic pathways, and functions.
