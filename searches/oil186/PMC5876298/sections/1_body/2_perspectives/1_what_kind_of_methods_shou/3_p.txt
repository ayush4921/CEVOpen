0: Analysis based on SIP is a typical strategy for bacterial community study that combines culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches.
1: First, cultivation is necessary to obtain molecular markers (DNA, RNA, proteins, or PLFA) that are labeled with a stable isotopic element (e.g.,  13C,  15N, and  18O).
2: The labeled molecular markers can then be analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing (clone library or NGS), metagenomic analysis, metatranscriptomic analysis, and mass spectrometer (MS) analysis.
3: These methods can be used to generate data to reveal the bacterial community and activity.
4: SIP analysis is a powerful tool for linking microbial species and metabolism (Dumont and Murrell,  2005).
5: By using DNA-SIP in combination with 16S rRNA gene clone libraries and T-RFLP analysis, Redmond and Valentine ( 2011) demonstrated that bacteria in the genus  Colwellia were active in ethane and propane oxidation in oil polluted deep-sea water plumes.
6: Mason et al.
7: ( 2014b) used surface sediments polluted by the DWH oil spill and  14C-labeled hydrocarbons to perform mineralization experiments.
8: They successfully found that the key hydrocarbon degradation pathway by sediment microbes was as follows: propylene glycol, dodecane, toluene, and phenanthrene.
9: By monitoring the biodegradation efficiency of  13C-labeled different hydrocarbons (aliphatic and aromatic), Gutierrez et al.
10: ( 2013) applied 16S rRNA gene-based NGS and qPCR detection to reveal the activity of bacterial communities.
11: The results indicated that the different bacterial phyla were responsible for the degradation of different hydrocarbons.
12: For instance, bacteria in the genera  Alcanivorax and  Marinobacter were found to be enriched in the experimental setups with the addition of aliphatic hydrocarbons, whereas  Alteromonas, Cycloclasticus, and  Colwellia dominated the experimental setups supplemented with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.
