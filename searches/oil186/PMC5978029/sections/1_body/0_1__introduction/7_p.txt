0: In this context, the results presented in this paper evidence the physicochemical properties and antibacterial activities of hydroxyapatite-lavender essential oil (HAp-L) and hydroxyapatite-basil essential oil (HAp-B) nanocomposites.
1: The morphology of the surfaces of the hydroxyapatite nanoparticles coated with essential oils was analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM).
2: The influence of the basil and lavender essential oils on the molecular structure of the HAp was investigated using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy measurements.
3: The antibacterial effect of hydroxyapatite coated with basil (HAp-B) and lavender (HAp-L) essential oil nanopowders (pressed into pellets) against Gram-positive (MRSA,  S. aureus) and Gram-negative ( E. coli) bacteria was also studied.
