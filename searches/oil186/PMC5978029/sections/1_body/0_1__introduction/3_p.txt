0: Essential oils are complex biostructures, and contain a lot of chemical compounds from different chemical classes: terpenoids, ketones, aldehydes, and esters, either saturated or with different levels of unsaturation, their chemical composition depending on the plants origin and quality, harvest time, climate, soil and especially extraction process [ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
1: About 90% of the bioactive components of EOs are monoterpenes.
2: In oxygenated form, the chemical constituents of EOs exhibit a better bioactivity.
