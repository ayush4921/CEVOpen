0: Hydroxyapatite (HAp) is a calcium phosphate compound and the best known biomaterial in terms of its morphological and compositional similarity with human hard tissue.
1: From a thermodynamic point of view, hydroxyapatite is the most stable calcium phosphate with regard to the physiological conditions of the human body, including temperature, body fluids composition and human pH.
2: The outstanding properties of HAp nanopowders, such as their biocompatibility, bioactivity, osteoconductivity and nontoxicity, have been demonstrated [ 1].
