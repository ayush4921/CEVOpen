0: Hydroxyapatite inorganic components (Ca 10(PO 4) 6(OH) 2) resemble, in the most favorable way, the natural biological apatite found in bone.
1: Therefore, it is of interest in medicine and biomedical engineering for bone regeneration and dental applications.
2: As a result of its biocompatibility, hydroxyapatite can be used for coating metal prostheses or dental implants, which is favorable for a successful osteointegration process.
3: On the other hand, it is well known that the risk of postoperative infections [ 2, 3, 4] can be drastically reduced by incorporating antibacterial agents in the chemical structure of hydroxyapatite.
