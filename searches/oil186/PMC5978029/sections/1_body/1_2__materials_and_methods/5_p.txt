0: The spectra of HAp-B and HAp-L samples were acquired using a Perkin Elmer spectrometer (Waltham, MS, USA) SP 100 equipped with an Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) accessory, in the spectral range of 4004000 cm 1 with a 4 cm 1 resolution.
1: The samples were placed on the ATR accessory without any preparation.
2: The background spectrum was acquired in air and taken as reference background spectrum.
3: Before and after the spectral analysis of each sample, the ATR diamond crystal was cleaned with an isopropyl alcohol solution.
4: The ATR plate cleaning was verified by recording the background spectrum after each sample measurement and comparing it with the reference background spectrum.
5: The acquired transmission IR spectra were transformed into absorption spectra according to the A = log (1/T) using the Perkin Elmer spectrometer, SPECTRUM software (Version 6.4.1, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MS, USA).
6: The fine structure of the obtained absorption spectra of the HAp, HAp-B, and HAp-L samples was revealed by peak fitting analysis.
7: The first step performed in the peak fitting analysis procedure was the baseline correction of the experimental infrared spectrum, followed by the second-order derivative calculation for peak wavenumbers finding.
8: Secondly, during the fitting analysis process, a Lorentz-type profile curve was used for each identified peak.
9: A sum of all the Lorentz fitted curves was generated by multiple iteration of the nonlinear least-squares data-fitting algorithm of the calculation software.
10: If the sum of all the fitted curves is set correctly, the algorithm gives a valid and convergent solution.
11: The theoretical curve obtained as a result of peak fitting analysis versus experimental IR curve was presented and analysed [ 13, 14].
