0: The specific surface area (S BET) cumulative pore volume (V p) and diameter of the pores (D p) of the HAp, HAp-B, HAp-L samples were determined using an ASAP 2020 instrument from the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm.
1: The measurements were performed at 77 K. The specific surface areas of the HAp, HAp-B, and HAp-L samples were determined by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method [ 11].
2: The total pore volume (V P) and pore size (D P) were calculated using the Barrett, Joyner, and Halenda (BJH) method [ 12].
