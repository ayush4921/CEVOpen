0: The tested microorganism strains that were used in this study were Gram-positive bacteria methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and  Staphylococcus aureus 0364 ( S. aureus 0364) and Gram-negative bacteria  Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, ( E. coli ATCC 25922).
1: The qualitative antibacterial assays were performed using microbial suspensions obtained from 1518 h solid cultures on tryptone soy agar (TSA).
2: The cultures were then transferred to fresh Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) and incubated for 23 h to reach the exponential growth phase.
3: The bacterial suspensions were adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standard (1  10 8 CFU/mL) and were spread on Mueller-Hinton agar plates evenly using a sterile swab.
4: Hydroxyapatite, and hydroxyapatite coated with lavender and basil EOs pellets were placed directly, aseptically and distinctively onto the previously inoculated MHA plates.
5: Agar plates were incubated at 37 C for 1824 h and the inhibition zones formed were measured in mm [ 15, 16].
6: The quantitative studies regarding the antibacterial activity of the HAp, HAp-B and HAp-L powders were performed by microdilution broth method in 96 multi-well plates [ 17, 18, 19].
7: The materials were solubilized in DMSO and two-fold dilutions of the samples ranging from 5 to 0.01 mg/mL were carried out in Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB).
8: Each tube was inoculated with microbial suspension adjusted to 0.5 McFarland and a volume of 100 L of each sample dissolved in DMSO as described above were added to the first well and a serial two-fold dilution was performed.
9: After incubation at 37 C for 1824 h, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values were determined by measuring the absorbance of the microbial suspensions at 620 nm.
