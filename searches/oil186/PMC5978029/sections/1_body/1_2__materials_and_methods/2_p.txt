0: The Ca 10(PO 4) 6(OH) 2 hydroxyapatite powders (HAp) were synthesized by an adapted coprecipitation method maintaining the molar ratio Ca:P = 1:67 [ 9] and using as precursors calcium nitrate (Ca(NO 3) 24H 2O, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), ammonium hydrogen phosphate ((NH 4) 2HPO 4; Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Richmond, VA, USA), ammonium hydroxide (NH 4OH, Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Richmond, VA, USA), and double distilled water.
1: Ca(NO 3) 24H 2O and (NH 4) 2HPO 4 were dissolved in deionized water and stirred vigorously for 2 h. The solution containing P was then added dropwise into the Ca-containing solution, and the new obtained mixture was magnetically stirred for 2 h at a temperature of 100 C. During the reaction, the pH value was constantly kept at 10.
2: The final product was washed with deionized water several times.
3: The obtained material (HAp) was dried for 48 h at 100 C. The HAp-B and HAp-L samples were obtained by mixing HAp powder with basil and lavender essential oil.
4: HAp, HAp-B and HAp-L powders were pressed into pellets with a diameter of 6 mm.
