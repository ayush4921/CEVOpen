0: The morphology of the samples was investigated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) using a HITACHI S4500 microscope (Hitachi, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).
1: Prior to recording the images, the powder samples were evenly dispersed in a specimen holder using as double coated conductive carbon tape conductive adhesive.
2: The sample holder containing the samples was introduced into the vacuum chamber, and all SEM images were recorded using a 5 kV electron acceleration voltage and an Everhart-Thornley detector (ETD).
3: The 3D surface plots of the SEM images were obtained using Image J software (ImageJ 1.51j8, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) [ 10].
