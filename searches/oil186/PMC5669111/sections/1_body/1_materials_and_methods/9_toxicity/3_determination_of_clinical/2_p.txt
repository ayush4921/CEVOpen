0: Following the experimental period, animals were fasted overnight and anesthetized.
1: According to guidelines of the Kerman University of Medical Sciences (Kerman, Iran) for the care and use of laboratory animals, we used ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) combination for anesthesia which in it some alpha-2 adrenoreceptor agonists (i.e., xylazine and medetomidine) do have analgesic properties and other analgesics such as opioids were not used.
2: Sodium pentobarbital (70 mg/kg, i.p.)
3: was used as euthanasia agent and then the abdomen was opened, and blood samples were collected from the heart.
4: In this work due to compliance with all standards of sterilization, we did not use any antibiotics.
5: For hematological studies, total blood was collected into tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid anticoagulant, and biochemical parameters, including hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell counts, red blood cell counts, and platelet counts, were measured.
6: To measure clinical chemistry parameters in serum, blood was collected into tubes containing no anticoagulant, allowed to clot, and serum was separated by centrifugation at 2000 g for 20 min.
7: The assays of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and bilirubin (direct and total) were performed using Roche Diagnostics Kits (Mannheim, Germany).
