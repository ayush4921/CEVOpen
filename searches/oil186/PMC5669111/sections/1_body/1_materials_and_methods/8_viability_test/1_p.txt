0: The viability was confirmed by flame cell motility and impermeability of the protoscoleces to 0.1% eosin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) solution under a light microscope (Smyth & Barrett, 1980).
1: After exposure, live protoscoleces remained colorless and exhibited characteristic muscular movements and flame cell activity, whereas dead protoscoleces absorbed stain and colored red [ Figure 1].
