0: To evaluate scolicidal effects, various concentrations of the essential oil were evaluated during 5, 10, 20, and 30 min.
1: Initially, 0.5 mL of the protoscoleces (2  10 3/mL) solution was poured in each test tube.
2: Then, 0.5 mL of different concentrations of the essential oil was added to test tubes.
3: The tubes were mixed gently and then incubated at 37C for 5, 10, 20, and 30 min.
4: After incubation, 50 L of 0.1% eosin stain was added to the remaining settled protoscoleces and mixed gently again.
5: After 10 min of incubation, the upper portion of the solution was discarded.
6: The remaining pellet of protoscoleces was then smeared on a glass slide and examined under a light microscope.
7: The mortality rate of the protoscoleces was determined by counting 300 protoscoleces.
8: [ 27] Moreover, normal saline plus Tween 20 and 20% hypertonic saline were used as negative and positive control, respectively.
