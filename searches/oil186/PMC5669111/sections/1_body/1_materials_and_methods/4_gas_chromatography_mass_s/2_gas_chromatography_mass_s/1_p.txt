0: GC/mass spectrometry (MS) analysis was carried out by a Thermoquest-Finnigan gas chromatograph equipped with fused silica capillary DB-5 column (30 m  0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 mm) coupled with a TRACE mass (Manchester, UK).
1: Helium was used as carrier gas with ionization voltage of 70 eV.
2: Ion source and interface temperatures were 230 and 280C, respectively.
3: Mass range was from 40 to 300 U. Oven temperature program was the same given above for the GC.
