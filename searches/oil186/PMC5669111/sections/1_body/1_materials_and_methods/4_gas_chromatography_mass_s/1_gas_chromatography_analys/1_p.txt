0: Gas chromatography (GC) analysis was carried out by a Shimadzu QP5050 with a HP-5MS column (30 m  0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 mm).
1: The column temperature was retained at 60C for 3 min and programmed to 180C at a rate of 5C/min and maintained constant at 275C for 5 min.
2: Injector and interface temperatures were 230 and 280C, respectively.
3: The flow rate of helium as carrier gas was (0.9 mL/min C.F).
4: The percentages were calculated by electronic integration of FID peak areas without the use of response factors correction.
5: Linear retention indices for all components were determined by coinjection of the samples with a solution containing homologous series of C8-C20  n-alkanes.
