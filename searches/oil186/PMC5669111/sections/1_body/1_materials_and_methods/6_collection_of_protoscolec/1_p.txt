0: The protoscoleces of hydatid cysts were collected from the livers of naturally infected sheep and goats slaughtered at Kerman abattoir, Southeast of Iran and transferred to the Parasitology Laboratory at the Department of Parasitology and Mycology, Kerman University of Medical Sciences (Kerman, Iran).
1: All hydatid cyst fluid aseptically aspirated by a 50 mL syringe and transferred into a glass tube was left for 30 min for protoscoleces to settle down.
2: After throwaway the supernatant, the protoscoleces were washed two times with PBS (pH 7.2) solution.
3: Finally, the number of protoscoleces per mL was adjusted as 2  10 3 protoscoleces in 0.9% NaCl solution with at least 90% viability rate.
