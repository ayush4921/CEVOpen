0: Cinnamon oil is an aromatic liquid obtained from the twigs, bark and leaves of  Cinnamomum zeylanicum [ 12].
1: Extracts of cinnamon bark (CNB) and leaves (CNL) have been used extensively as therapeutics in many cultures since antiquity.
2: The anti-candida activity of CNB oil against planktonic and biofilm culture of  C. albicans and  non- albicans spp.
3: has been documented [ 7,  13 15].
4: The main constituents of CNB oil include trans-cinnamaldehyde, and minor components such as eugenyl acetate, linalool, and benzyl benzoate, each having antifungal activity [ 16 20].
5: CNB oil has been shown to alter cell membrane permeability and fluidity, and inhibit biofilm formation [ 7,  13,  15,  21], but the mechanisms of toxicity remain unknown.
6: On the other hand, each component has been extensively studied, showing effects at various cellular sites, including the cell membrane and cytosol.
7: For example, cinnamaldehyde, the major constituent of CNB oil, targets the membrane and causes increased cell wall thickness in  C. albicans [ 16], attributed to -1-3-glucan synthase inhibition as observed in  Saccharomyces cerevisiae [ 22].
8: The increase in bud scar formation upon cinnamaldehyde exposure also suggests an impact on cell division, resulting in decreased viability [ 16,  23].
9: Benzyl benzoate and linalool affect membrane fluidity and induce cell cycle arrest at the G2-M and G1 phases, respectively [ 20] at concentrations greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) [ 7,  16,  17,  23].
10: We hypothesized that the cell wall and membrane are primary targets of CNB oil, which in turn disrupt intracellular processes vital to  Candida survival.
