0: Here, we report a detailed characterization of the anticandidal effects of CNB oil using atomic force microscopy (AFM), laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) and traditional biochemical assays.
1: AFM quantitative imaging (QITM) is a powerful tool for assessing the impact of antifungals [ 24 28], nutrient stress [ 29], oxidative stress [ 30] and characterizing yeast genetic mutants [ 31], while LSCM imaging of fluorescent markers can delineate defects in intracellular processes.
2: AFM was used to quantify the morphological, ultrastructural and biophysical properties of RSY150 and a clinical isolate exposed to CNB oil.
3: The RSY150 strain of  C. albicans with RFP tagged histone protein B (Htb-RFP) and GFP tagged -tubulin (Tub2-GFP) was used to track cell cycle defects in response to CNB oil exposure.
4: Finally biochemical assays were used to verify physiological changes identified by imaging.
5: We report for the first time that CNB oil causes -tubulin depolymerisation and cell cycle arrest, which we attribute to its major constituent cinnamaldehyde.
