0: Candida albicans, a commensal fungi, develops into a resilient pathogen under low host immunity such as that for immunocompromised individuals with HIV/AIDS, and patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy [ 1 3].
1: A limited number of antifungals are available for treating such infections, and the use of these antifungal classes, including azoles, echinocandins, polyenes and allylamines, can be accompanied by side effects.
2: Poor bioavailability requires higher doses, which can ultimately result in resistance and ineffectiveness [ 4].
3: The continued high morbidity following systemic fungal infection and emerging resistance to antifungal agents underscore a clear need for alternatives [ 5].
4: In this context, essential oils (EOs) are gaining popularity due to their strong antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity [ 6,  7].
5: EO combinations with other essential oils or existing antifungal agents could vastly reduce the probability of multi-drug resistance [ 6 11].
6: However, comprehensive studies are required to fully assess their independent pharmacological properties and potential side effects prior to consideration for clinical use as antifungal agents.
