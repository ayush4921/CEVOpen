0: The effects of CNB oil treatment on the cell cycle was determined by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) [ 35].
1: RSY150 cells expressing Tub2-GFP and Htb-RFP [ 35] at mid logarithmic phase (10 7 cells/mL) were treated with CNB oil, cinnamaldehyde and linalool at MIC and 1/2 MIC for 4 h. Treated and control cells were transferred to glass slides sealed with clean coverslips and imaged at 63  magnification on a Zeiss LSM 780 system (Carl Zeiss Micro imaging, Oberkochen, Germany) using an argon laser ( ex = 488 nm;  em = 512 nm) for Tub2-GFP and HeNe laser ( ex = 543 nm;  em = 605 nm) for Htb-RFP.
2: Cells were identified and enumerated in each cycle phase category.
3: Statistical significance was calculated from three independent experiments.
