0: Hyphal induction in  C. albicans RSY150 was performed according to the literature [ 46].
1: Briefly, a yeast suspension (1  10 7 CFU/mL) was prepared from mid logarithmic phase cells in pre-warmed YPD with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and deposited into a 12 well plate with the appropriate amounts of CNB oil to achieve MIC and 1/2 MIC.
2: Control cultures lacked CNB oil.
3: The cells were stained with CFW (0.01 g/mL) to highlight hyphae and pseudo hyphae after 4 h incubation at 37 C, and images captured on an AxioObserver Z1 inverted epifluorescence microscope (Oberkochen, Germany).
4: Germ tubes were identified when the cell projection was equal to the size of the blastospore.
5: Results from three independent experiments were reported as average  standard deviation.
