0: The MIC of CNB oil was determined for all strains listed in Table  1 following the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [CLSI 2014] [ 38] and previously reported method [ 15], with slight modifications.
1: Briefly, 100 l of CNB oil (stock concentration 1000 g/mL) was serially diluted in triplicate in the wells of flat-bottom polystyrene 96-well microtiter plates (Sarstedt, Numbrecht, Germany).
2: A suspension (OD 600 = 0.001) of  C. albicans (2.2  10 5 cells/mL) in YPD was added, with appropriate positive (amphotericin B) and negative ( Candida only in media) controls and a blank (CNB oil in media) included.
3: The microtiter plates were sealed with parafilm prior to incubation at 30 C to avoid oil evaporation, and the OD 600 recorded after 24 h (Biotek Epoch; Northern Vermont, USA).
4: The endpoint was defined as the lowest concentration of the compound resulting in total inhibition (MIC 100%) of growth, compared to the growth in negative control wells.
5: All experiments were performed in triplicate.
6: The MICs for cinnamaldehyde (stock concentration 450 g/mL) and linalool (stock concentration 9.85 mg/mL) were also tested for RSY150 and RSY35 [ 16,  39,  40].
