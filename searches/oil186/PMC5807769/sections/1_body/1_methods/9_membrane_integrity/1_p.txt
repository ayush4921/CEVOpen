0: To assess the integrity of the cell membrane following CNB oil exposure, the cellular content leakage assay [ 43] was carried out with slight modification.
1: Briefly, a mid logarithmic phase culture of  C. albicans RSY150 was washed three times and resuspended to ~10 7 CFU/mL in PBS.
2: Cell suspensions were transferred to a 24 well plate containing CNB oil at MIC, 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 MIC in PBS, and incubated at 30 C for 6 h with shaking (200 rpm).
3: CNB oil in PBS served as a blank, untreated cells in PBS as negative controls, and amphotericin B at MIC served as a positive control.
4: Following incubation, cell leakage was analyzed from supernatant diluted 1:10 with PBS based on absorbance at 260 nm (Varian Cary 100 BIO, UVVIS spectrophotometer; Midland, ON, Canada) against a blank lacking CNB oil.
5: Nucleotides represent one class of leakage components that absorb at 260 nm, for which uracil containing compounds have the highest absorbance.
6: Mean ratios for each treatment from three independent experiments were calculated and compared to that of corresponding untreated samples.
