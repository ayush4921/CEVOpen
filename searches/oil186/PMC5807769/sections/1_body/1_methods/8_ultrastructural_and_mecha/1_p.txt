0: The cell surface biophysical properties of CNB oil treated  C. albicans RSY150 and a clinical isolate from blood were analyzed by Quantitative Imaging (QITM) using a Nanowizard III AFM (JPK Instruments, Berlin, Germany) as described previously [ 47,  48].
1: Briefly, cell suspensions (2.2  10 5 cells/mL) from both strains treated either with YPD only (control) or YPD with 1/2 MIC CNB oil for 24 h were deposited onto poly- l-Lysine coated cover slips for 1 h, fixed with formalin and air dried prior to AFM imaging.
2: Cells treated with the fungal wall degrading enzyme, glucanase, served as a positive control.
3: Samples were imaged with silicon nitride cantilevers (HYDRA6R-200NG; Nanosensors, Neuchatel, Switzerland) having calibrated spring constants ranging from 0.03 to 0.062 N/m.
