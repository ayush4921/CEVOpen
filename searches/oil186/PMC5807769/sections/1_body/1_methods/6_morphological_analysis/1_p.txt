0: Calcofluor white (CFW) at a concentration of 0.01 g/mL was used as a chitin specific dye [ 35] to highlight the gross morphology and chitin distribution in CNB oil treated RSY150 along with blood and genital clinical isolates.
1: Cell suspensions at two growth phases each, mid logarithmic (1  10 7 cells/mL) and stationary (2.2  10 5 cells/mL), were treated with MIC and 1/2 MIC of CNB oil and imaged on an Axio Observer Z1 inverted epifluorescence microscope (Oberkochen, Germany) at 63 magnification ( ex = 365 nm;  em = 435 nm).
