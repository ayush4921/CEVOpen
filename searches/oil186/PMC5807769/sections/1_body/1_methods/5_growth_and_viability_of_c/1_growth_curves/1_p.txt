0: To investigate the effect of CNB oil on growth kinetics of  C. albicans, an overnight culture of  C. albicans RSY150 diluted to contain 2.2  10 5 cells/mL (OD 600 of 0.001) was treated with CNB oil (62.5, 31.25 and 15.1 g/mL corresponding to 1/2 MIC, 1/4 MIC and 1/8 MIC) in separate wells of a microtiter plate in triplicate and incubated at 30 C [ 41,  42].
1: The OD 600 was measured at 30 min intervals for 24 h using a BioTek Synergy HTX multi-mode microplate reader (Northern Vermont, USA).
2: Media with CNB oil was used to determine background absorbance for three independent experiments.
