0: The cell viability after CNB oil exposure was determined using the methylene blue dye exclusion assay, as reported previously [ 43].
1: Briefly, mid logarithmic phase  C. albicans RSY150 cultures (2.2  10 5 cells/mL) were treated with various concentrations (62.5, 31.25 and 15.1 g/mL corresponding to 1/2 MIC, 1/4 MIC and 1/8 MIC) of CNB oil at 30 C for 24 h. Cells fixed with formaldehyde were used as positive controls for staining.
2: The cells were washed and resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS;0.01 M pH 7.4) to ~ 10 7 CFU/mL, then 100 L of treated and control cell suspensions mixed with 100 L methylene blue (0.1 mg/mL stock solution in 2% sodium citrate) and incubated for 5 min at room temperature.
3: Cells were examined using an Eclipse 80i microscope (Nikon) at 40 magnification.
4: A minimum of 100 cells in consecutive visual fields were examined and the percentage of stained cells were calculated using the Nikon SPOT software [ 44].
