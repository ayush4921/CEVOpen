0: The sensitivity of  C albicans to cell wall perturbing agents (Congo red (CR) and CFW) after exposure to CNB oil was tested following a previously reported method [ 6], with minor modifications.
1: Briefly, overnight stationary phase cultures of  C. albicans RSY150 (2.2  10 5 cell/mL) in YNB complete media, unexposed or exposed to CNB oil at 1/2 MIC and 1/4 MIC, were incubated for 24 h with shaking (200 rpm) at 30 C in a microtiter plate.
2: Cells were washed with PBS to eliminate oil residues and any carryover effect of the oil to different wells.
3: An aliquot (5 L) of each was diluted to final densities of 10 5, 10 4, 10 3 cells/mL and were spotted on YNB plates supplemented with one of the following cell wall disrupting agents: CFW (15 g/mL) or CR (15 g/mL).
4: The plates were incubated at 30 C and monitored for  Candida growth over 3 days.
5: Each experiment was performed in triplicate and colonies counted for statistical analysis and graphical representation.
