0: CNB oil was analyzed using gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID) and gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GCMS) with an Agilent 7890A GC according to previously reported methods [ 32,  33].
1: Briefly, 1 l of diluted CNB oil (1:10 in ethanol) was injected onto a HP-5 column (30 mm  0.32 mm  0.25 m) and separated using a carrier gas of helium (constant flow of 1.1 mL/min) with the following temperature gradient: 60 C for 5 min, increased to 210 C at 3 C/min and to 260 C at 10 C/min.
2: The GC-FID injector and detector temperatures were 250 C and the split ratio of injection was 20:1.
3: For GCMS using similar conditions, 0.2 l was injected with a split ratio of 200:1 and separated on a HP-5MS column (30 mm  0.25 mm  0.25 um).
