0: Candida albicans strains and clinical isolates used in this study are described in Table  1.
1: The RSY150 and RSY35 strains were a kind gift of Dr. Richard J. Bennett.
2: RSY150 expresses Tub2-GFP and Htb-RFP and RSY35 is a Kar3 deletion mutant that express only Tub2-GFP [ 35].
3: Kar3 is a bifunctional protein having a kinesin-like motor domain joined to a distinct microtubule binding domain that is essential for yeast nuclear fusion during mating [ 36].
4: Strains were stored as 50% glycerol stocks at  80 C and were freshly revived on yeast-extract peptone dextrose agar (YPDA) containing 1% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, 2% glucose and 2% Bacto-agar prior to each experiment.
5: All strains were grown with continuous shaking (200 rpm) at 30 C in YPD broth and the mutant strains supplemented with 80 mg/L uridine (YPDU).
6: For the yeast to hyphal transition and leakage assays, cells were grown to mid log phase before exposure to CNB oil.
7: For hyphal induction experiments, cells were grown in YPD broth with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2% glucose.
