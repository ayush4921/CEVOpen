1: 2CNB oil exposure induces a cell wall stress response with altered chitin distribution in RSY150.
2: Epifluorescence (top panel) and bright field (bottom panel) images of CFW stained cells.
3: Cells were grown in YPD in (   a) and (   b) while cells in (   c) were grown in YPD plus 10% serum for hyphal induction.
4: a RSY150 cells were incubated for 24 h with and without 1/2 and 1/4 MIC CNB oil in YPD media and stained with CFW.
5: b Mid log phase RSY150 were exposed to MIC and 1/2 MIC for 4 h stained with CFW and imaged.
6: c Cells grown in YPD with 10% serum were exposed to the same concentration as in (   b) for 4 h, stained with CFW and imaged.
7: (   d,    e,    f) are bar graphs showing enumeration of cells in (   a,    b and    c) respectively, where double asterisks indicate p < 0.05.
