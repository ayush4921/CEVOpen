1: 3Surface remodelling of RSY150    C. albicans exposed to 1/2 MIC CNB oil.
2: RSY150 and the clinical isolate from blood were treated with 1/2 MIC (62.5 g/mL) CNB oil for 24 h, deposited and fixed on PLL-coated cover slips for AFM imaging.
3: Images (1 m; 128 px   2) of control and CNB oil treated cells are at low resolution for control (   a,    c) and treated (   b,    d)    C. albicans showing leakage (arrow heads) in treated cells.
4: High resolution (1 m) height images of the cell surface (boxed area) for control (   e,    g) and CNB treated (   f,    h)    C. albicans reveal increased surface roughness in the treated clinical isolate as compared to the treated RSY150 strain.
5: (   i,    j,    k,    l) High resolution (1 m) adhesion maps from corresponding height images.
