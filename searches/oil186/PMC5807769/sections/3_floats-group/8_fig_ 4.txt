1: 4CNB treated RSY150    C. albicans exhibit a cell wall stress response.
2: Logarithmic phase RSY150 cells were treated with 1/2 and 1/4 MIC CNB oil or without oil for 24 h.    a Treated and control cells at 10   5, 10   4 and 10   3 CFU were spotted on YNB complete media agar containing CFW and CR and examined after 2 days.
3: Treated cells showed greater sensitivity to cell wall stressors.
4: b The number of colonies on the CR and CFW plates show a dose dependent effect that decreases as a function of oil concentration.
5: The 1/2 MIC CNB oil was more effective than 1/4 MIC, with a significant difference ** between 1/2 MIC oil treatment compared to untreated controls (p < 0.05).
6: The cell count was normalized with treated cells grown on YNB media agar only.
7: c Wild type background strain (CaSS1) and cell wall defective mutants (   SSU81, CRH, DFG and    VPS) were exposed to a twofold increasing dilution of CNB oil in a MIC assay, showing overall sensitivity to the CNB oil and indicating a moderate cell wall stress response
