1: 5CNB oil exposure in RSY150    C. albicans caused spindle defects in RSY150 and a delayed cell cycle.
2: Mid logarithmic phase RSY150 cells were treated with MIC and 1/2 MIC oil for 4 h and imaged live by LSCM (Tub2-GFP    ex = 488 nm;    em = 512 nm and Htb-RFP    ex = 543 nm;    em = 605 nm).
3: RSY150 were examined for nuclear and spindle localization in budding cells.
4: a Spindle morphologies of MIC and 1/2 MIC CNB oil treated cells and untreated control.
5: Control cells showed normal spindle formation during mitosis (arrow heads) whereas the MIC treated cells had a majority of dividing cells lacking a mitotic spindle (small arrow heads).
6: Cells treated with 1/2 MIC of CNB oil had diminished spindle defects.
7: Despite the spindle defect, the cells completed mitosis.
8: Images are representative from three independent experiments.
9: Bar = 5 m.    b Cell cycle analysis of cells treated with MIC and 1/2 MIC CNB oil and untreated controls.
10: Of cells treated at MIC CNB oil, 14% were in anaphase in comparison to 10% for control cells, whereas 12% of cells exposed to 1/2 MIC CNB oil were in anaphase.
11: c The number of cells counted for treated and control cells in anaphase were plotted.
12: Double asterisks represent statistical significance (p < 0.05).
13: For each treatment 250 cells were analyzed
