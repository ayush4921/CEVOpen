0: Fig.
1: 1CNB oil decreased cell viability and compromised cell membrane integrity in RSY150.
2: a Growth curves of RSY150 exposed to 125, 62.5, 31.25 and 15.125 g/mL of CNB oil, with absorbance measured at 30 min intervals to show the antifungal time course of the CNB oil.
3: b Methylene blue staining of cells exposed to CNB concentrations as in (   a) showed decreased cell viability.
4: c Corresponding CFU counts of viable CNB exposed cells as compared to control.
5: d Leakage of cellular content as a function of absorbance at 260 nm following exposure to CNB oil at concentrations as in (   a) confirm a dose dependent compromise of the cell membrane in (   a).
6: GC indicates growth controls of cells incubated without CNB oil.
7: Double asterisks represent statistical significance (p < 0.05)
