1: Spindle morphology of cinnamaldehyde and linalool treated C. albicans.
2: Live LSCM of mid log phase cells after 4 h exposure to MIC and 1/2 MIC of cinnamaldehyde and linolool.
3: Cinnamaldehyde treated C. albicans at MIC showed a similar spindle morphology of those treated with CNB oil at MIC, whereas linalool treated cells showed a complete absence of tubulin at MIC, with decreased cell size.
4: At 1/2 MIC for both cinnamaldehyde and linalool, tubulin expression appeared as fluorescent spots near the nucleus.
5: Bar = 5 m.
