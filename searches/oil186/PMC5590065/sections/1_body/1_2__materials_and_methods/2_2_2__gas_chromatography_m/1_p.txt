0: The volatile oils were subjected to GC-MS analysis on an Agilent system consisting of a model 7890N gas chromatograph, a model mass detector Triple Quad 7000A in electron impact (EI) mode at 70 eV ( m/ z range 40600 amu) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and an Agilent ChemStation data system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
1: The GC column (Crawford Scientific Ltd, Scotland, UK) was an HP-5ms fused silica capillary with a (5% phenyl)-methyl polysiloxane stationary phase (30 m  250 m  0.25 m).
2: The carrier gas was helium with a column head pressure of 9.7853 psi and a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min.
3: Inlet temperature and mass selective detector (MDS) temperature was 250 C. The GC oven temperature program was used as follows: 50 C initial temperature, held for 5 min; increased at 6 C/min to 190 C for 20 min; increased at 7 C/min to 290 C for 15 min; increased at 7 C/min to 300 C for 10 min.
4: The sample was dissolved in dichloromethane, and 2 L was injected (split ratio 10:1; split flow 12 mL/min).
