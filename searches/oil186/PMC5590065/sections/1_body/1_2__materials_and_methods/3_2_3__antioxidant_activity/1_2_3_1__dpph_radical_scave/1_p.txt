0: The DPPH free radical scavenging of the  A. danielli essential oils and ascorbic acid prepared in methanol at various concentrations (20100 g/mL) were evaluated according to the method of Shekhar and Anju [ 19].
1: One millilitre of 0.1 mM DPPH solution in methanol was added to 3 mL the solutions prepared with the oils and standard, and stirred for 1 min.
2: Each mixture was kept in the dark at room temperature for 30 min and the absorbance was recorded against a blank at 517 nm.
3: The assays were carried out in triplicate and the results were expressed as mean values  standard deviation.
4: Lower absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated higher free radical activity.
5: Percentage scavenging activity was calculated using the expression:  (1)%Scavenging activity= Absorbance of ControlAbsorbance of SampleAbsorbance of Control  100
