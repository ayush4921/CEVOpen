0: The DPPH assay was performed by adding 2 mL of methanolic DPPH solution (24 g mL -1) to 50 L of various concentrations of the EOs (1.0, 2.5, 5.0 and 10 mg mL -1) in methanol.
1: The absorbance of prepared solutions and the blank, containing the same chemicals without any antioxidant, were recorded at 517 nm (Pharmacia LKB Novaspec, Uppsala, Sweden), after an incubation period of 60 min at room temperature in a dark place.
2: Moreover, the  capacity of the EOs to scavenge DPPH radicals was calculated as follows:  15
