0: Agar disk diffusion assay.
1: Sterile paper disks (6 mm in diameter) were impregnated with 20 L of two concentrations (10 and 15 mg mL -1) of  M. officinalis and  D. moldavica EOs and then placed on the surface of the nutrient agar plates inoculated with 0.1 mL of the bacterial cultures (1.5  10 6 CFU mL -1) under aseptic condition.
2: The plates were then incubated at 37  C for 24 hr and the diameters of inhibition zones were measured using a caliper.
3: Vancomycin and ampicillin antibiotic disks were used as control positives.
