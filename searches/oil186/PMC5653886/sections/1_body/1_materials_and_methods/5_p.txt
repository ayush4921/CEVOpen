0: Micro-well dilution assay.
1: Micro-well dilution assay was used to determine minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the EOs against the tested bacterial strains ( E. coli,  L. monocytogenes,  S. aureus and  S. typhimurium).
2: Bacterial suspensions were prepared while being in log phase, conformed to the 0.5 McFarland standard turbidity and serially diluted (1:10) to achieve the desired concentration (1.5  10 6 CFU mL -1).
3: The EOs were dissolved in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, then the solutions were prepared at the concentration of 40 mg mL -1 as a stock solution, and then the serial two-fold dilutions were made in a concentration range from 0.62 to 40 mg mL -1in nutrient broth.
4: Briefly, 160 L of the nutrient broth, 20 L of the inoculums and 20 L of the EOs were added into each well.
5: 13 Subsequently, the wells without any bacteria and the wells without any EOs were considered as negative and positive controls, respectively.
6: The microplates were mixed gently and incubated at 37  C for 24 hr.
7: The final volume in each well was 200 L, the final concentrations of EOs were in a range between 0.062 to 4.000 mg mL -1 and the final bacterial suspensions in the wells were approximately 1.510 5 CFU mL -1.
8: The lowest concentration with no visible bacterial growth was regarded as MIC values of the EOs.
9: The MBC values were determined by inoculating 10 L of none-turbid wells on BHI agar, while the lowest concentration with no visible bacterial growth on the agar was  regarded as MBC values of the EOs.
