0: Radical scavenging activity of the EOs against ABTS + was measured according to the previously described procedure.
1: 17 The ABTS solution (7.0 mmol L -1) and potassium persulphate solution (2.45 mmol L -1) in distilled water were separately prepared and reacted together to produce ABTS radicals.
2: The mixture was kept in the dark at room temperature for 16 hr.
3: The ABTS + solution was diluted with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) to an absorbance of 0.70 at 734 nm.
4: Aliquots of 200 L of various concentrations (1.0, 2.5, 5.0 and 10 10 mg mL -1) of the EOs in methanol and the reference antioxidants (ascorbic acid and BHT) were added to 2 mL of ABTS + solution and mixed vigorously.
5: After an incubation period of 6 min at room temperature, the absorbance was measured at 734 nm and the ABTS + scavenging effect was calculated formulas follows:
