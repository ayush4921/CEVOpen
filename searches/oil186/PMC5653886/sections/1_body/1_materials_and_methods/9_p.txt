0: The BCBT was carried out as previously described with minor modification.
1: 16 A solution of 0.5 mg -carotene (type I synthetic; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) in 1 mL chloroform was prepared in a flask.
2: Then 25 L linoleic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) and 400 mg Tween 40 (Sigma-Aldrich) were added into the flask.
3: The chloroform was removed completely using a rotary evaporator (Model 4003; Heidolph Laborata, Schwabach, Germany) at 40  C and then 100 mL of distilled water was added and shaken vigorously.
4: Aliquots 2.5 mL of this emulsion were transferred into a series of test tubes containing 350 L of various concentrations (1.0, 2.5, 5.0 and 10 mg mL -1) of the EOs.
5: The same procedure was repeated with butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and ascorbic acid as reference antioxidants along with a blank.
6: The absorbance of each tube was measured at 470 nm immediately at zero time and also after a two-hour period while the tubes were kept in a water bath at 50 C. The capacity of the EOs to protect against oxidation of -carotene was determined as follows:
