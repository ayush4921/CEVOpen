0: Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis.
1: The GC/MS analysis of EOs were performed using a Hewlett Packard 5890 (Hewlett Packard Corporation, Palo Alto, USA) equipped with an HP-5MS capillary column (30  0.25 mm inner diameter and 0.25 mm film thickness).
2: The Helium flow rate was one mL per min.
3: The column temperature was initially 50  C and then gradually increased to 120  C at 2  C per min rate, held for 3 min, and finally increased to 300  C. The MS procedure was operated through ionization energy of 70 eV.
4: Thereafter, the compounds were identified by comparing their retention indices with those of authentic samples and the mass spectral data available in the library (Wiley-VCH 2001 data software, Weinheim, Germany).
