0: The objective of this research was to study, for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, the composition of three different Kainari samples from three villages of Lesvos Island (Greece), as well as to evaluate the total phenolic content (TPC) and the potential antioxidant and antimicrobial activity.
1: Six volatile compounds and two azo food dyes have been isolated and identified.
2: The total phenolic content was estimated by Folin-Ciocalteu method and the free radical scavenging activity was determined by DPPH and ABTS assays.
3: Moreover, the antimicrobial activity of the samples was tested against six Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, two oral pathogens, and three pathogenic fungi.
