0: The organic layer C2 was chromatographed through preparative thin layer chromatography on silica gel plates using cyclohexane/dichloromethane 30/70 v/v as mobile phase, yielding cinnamic aldehyde, myristicin, cinnamyl alcohol, alpha-terpinyl acetate, and  -caryophyllene.
1: All compounds were identified through NMR and/or GC-MS and literature data [ 11,  12].
