0: In the distillate A was added 2 g of NaCl and the solution was cooled in ice water and transferred to a separatory funnel with 50 mL of hexane.
1: The aqueous layer A1 was discarded, and the organic layer A2 was evaporated via rotary evaporation (R-200, Buchi, Flawil, Switzerland) to yield an oily extract C. In the extract C 15 mL hexane and 25 mL of 5% NaOH were added for further liquid-liquid separation.
2: The aqueous layer C1 contained the sodium salt of eugenol, while the eugenol acetate,  -caryophyllene, myristicin, and cinnamic aldehyde remained in the organic layer C2.
