0: (ii) Isolation of Azo Dyes.
1: The freeze-dried herbal teas of KN1 and KN2 (454 mg), which presented the same chromatographic profile, and the freeze-dried herbal tea of KN3 (450 mg) were separately further purified using a medium pressure liquid chromatography MPLC (Borosilikat 3.3 Code Number 28147, Buchi, Flawil, Switzerland) packed with reversed phase silica gel (RP18) and two Series 1 pumps with flow speed 8 mL/min, eluted with decreasing polarities: H 2O/MeOH (100/0 to 0/100).
2: Azorubine was isolated and identified from the water fraction of KN1-KN2 and amaranth from KN3.
3: The isolated compounds were identified by NMR and literature data [ 13].
