0: (ii) GC-MS Analysis.
1: The analyses were performed on a HP 6890 GC with 5973 MSD (Hewlett-Packard, Germany), with ionization energy 70 eV.
2: The GC is equipped with a 1/10 split/splitless injector and a 30 m long DP5 capillary column, 0.25 mm internal diameter, and 0.25 mm thickness.
3: The temperature in the injection sample was 200C and gas was He and flow rate is 0.7 mL/min.
4: Identification was made using the Wiley275 library and bibliographic data.
5: The temperature programs that have been used are the following:
