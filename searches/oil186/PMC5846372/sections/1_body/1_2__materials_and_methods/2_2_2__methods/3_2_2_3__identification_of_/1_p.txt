0: (i) Headspace Solid-Phase Microextraction (HS-SPME).
1: The rich aroma of the Kainari samples was studied through HS-SPME/GC-MS analyses [ 14].
2: The HS-SPME was performed with carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane coated fiber (75  m coating 57330-U, Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) attached in a manual SPME fiber holder (Supelco).
3: For SPME extraction, 10 mg of each sample in a glass vial (15 mL) closed with PTFE coated silicone rubber septum was used.
4: The temperature in our experiment was set at 7075C and the vial with sample was placed on the hot-plate for 15 minutes.
5: After that time, the fiber was exposed for 5 minutes and then it was transferred to perform GC-MS analysis.
