0: Alongside, 25  L of extracts or standard solution of gallic acid (2.5 to 100  g/mL) in DMSO was added to 125  L of a Folin-Ciocalteu solution (10% v/v), followed by 100  L of sodium carbonate (7.5% w/v) in a 96-well plate.
1: The reagents were mixed and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature protected from light and the absorbance was measured at 765 nm.
2: Total phenolic content was expressed as mg Gallic Acid Equivalents per gram of dry extract (mg GAE/g dry extract).
3: The content of phenolics for each extract was determined in triplicate.
