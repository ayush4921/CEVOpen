0: (ii) 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) Assay.
1: The DPPH radical scavenging assay was performed according to a previously described method [ 15].
2: The stock DPPH solution (314  M) was prepared in absolute ethanol and kept in dark at room temperature until its use.
3: Gallic acid was used as a positive control (IC50: 4.5  g/mL) and the total extracts were diluted in DMSO at appropriate concentrations.
4: Briefly, in a 96-well plate, 190  L of the DPPH solution and 10  L of gallic acid or samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature protected from light and the absorbance was measured at 517 nm.
5: A negative control containing 10  L DMSO and 190  L DPPH was performed each time, as well as blanks containing 10  L sample and 190  L EtOH.
