0: (iii) 2,2-Azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic Acid) (ABTS) Assay.
1: The ABTS radical cation scavenging assay was performed using the method reported by Re et al.
2: (1999) with slight modifications [ 16].
3: In brief, a stock ABTS aqua solution (7 mM) was reacted with potassium persulfate aqua solution (2.45 mM) and kept overnight in dark to yield a dark colored solution containing ABTS + radical cation.
4: Trolox was used as a positive control (IC50: 8.3  g/mL) and the total extracts were diluted in DMSO at appropriate concentrations.
5: Prior to use in the assay, the ABTS + radical cation was diluted with distilled water for an initial absorbance of about 0.700 (0.02) at 734 nm.
6: Afterwards, in a 96-well plate 100  l of ABTS + radical cation solution and 50  l of Trolox or samples were added, incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and protected from light and the absorbance was measured at 734 nm.
7: A negative control containing 50  L DMSO and 100  L ABTS was performed each time, as well as blanks containing 50  L sample and 100  L dist.
8: H 2O.
