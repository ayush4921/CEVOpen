0: (i) Total Phenolic Content (TPC).
1: It was determined by using Folin-Ciocalteu method with slight modifications [ 15].
2: As referred to literature, 10 mg of each crude methanol extract or lyophilized herbal tea was dissolved in 1 mL of corresponding extracting solvent to produce the stock of sample solution.
3: The lower concentrations of sample were prepared by diluting 100  L of the stock sample solution with 900  L methanol or distilled water.
4: Then, 50  L of sample was put in a test tube and mixed with 60  L of Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, followed by an addition of 120  L of 35% sodium carbonate after 3 minutes.
5: Then, the resulting mixture was incubated in dark at room temperature for an hour and absorbance was measured at 725 nm (UV-1700, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) after incubation.
6: Caffeic acid was used as calibrated standard and results were expressed as milligram Caffeic Acid Equivalent per gram of dry extract (mg CAE/g dry extract).
7: The content of phenolics for each extract was determined in triplicate.
