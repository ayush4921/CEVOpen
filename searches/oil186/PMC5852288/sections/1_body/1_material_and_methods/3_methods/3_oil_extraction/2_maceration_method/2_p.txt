0: This method was used for oil extraction from dried samples  (DCB,  DTRCB 5min,  DTRCB 10 min,  DORCB 5 min and  DORCB 10 min) as described by Womeni et al .[13].
1: The beans were separately grinded to pass 1 mm sieve.
2: Eighty grams of each power was separately macerated in 400 mL of hexane at room temperature for 24 h with constant shaking.
3: After that, the mixture was filtered using the Whatman paper N1, and the filtrate was concentrated on a rotatory evaporator at 40 C. The extracted oils were stored in the refrigerator at 4 C for further analysis.
4: The remaining solid fractions were dried in the oven at 50 C for the determination of their proximate composition.
