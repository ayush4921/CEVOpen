0: Oils were extracted from fresh cocoa beans  (FCB) by the method described by Bligh and Dyer  [14].
1: About 80 g of beans were introduced in a grinding machine (Moulinex) to which 100 mL of chloroform and 200 mL of methanol were subsequently added.
2: The mixture was grinded for 3 min; followed by the addition of 100 mL of chloroform and 100 mL of distilled water.
3: The mixture was again grinded for 1 min, and filtered.
4: The final extraction was ensured by the addition of chloroform, in order to respect the following proportion: 2:2:1.8 for chloroform, methanol and water respectively.
5: After separating the different phases in a funnel, the organic phase was collected and dried using sodium anhydrous.
6: The organic solvent was then eliminated by evaporation on a rotatory evaporator at 45 C under reduced pressure.
7: The extracted oil was stored in the refrigerator at 4 C for further analysis.
