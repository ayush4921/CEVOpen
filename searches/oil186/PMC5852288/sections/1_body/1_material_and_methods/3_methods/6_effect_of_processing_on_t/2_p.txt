0: The ability of each extract to scavenge the DPPH radical was determined according to the method of Braca et al .[16].
1: A total of 4.5 mL of 0.002% alcoholic solution of DPPH was added to 0.5 mL of different concentrations (250, 500, 1000, and 2000 g/mL) of samples and standard solutions separately, in order to have final concentrations of products of 25200 g/mL.
2: The samples were kept at room temperature in the dark and after 30 min and the absorbance of the resulting solution was measured at 517 nm.
3: The absorbance of the samples, control, and blank was measured in comparison with methanol.
4: The antioxidant activity (AA) was calculated according to the formula: AA%=AbsControlAbsSample100/AbsControl
