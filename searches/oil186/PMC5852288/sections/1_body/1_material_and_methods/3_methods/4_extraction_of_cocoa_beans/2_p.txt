0: The extraction of cocoa beans was done as described by Womeni et al .[13].
1: Twenty grams of each processed cocoa powder  (DCB,  DTRCB 5min,  DTRCB 10 min,  DORCB 5 min and  DORCB 10 min) was extracted with 400 mL of methanol for 48 h at room temperature.
2: The mixture was regularly subjected to shaking during the extraction.
3: The extract was filtered with a Whatman No.
4: 1 filter paper, and residue was again extracted with 200 mL of methanol to ensure maximum extraction of phenolic compounds.
5: The combined filtrates were subjected to rotary evaporation at 40 C under reduced pressure for the removal of the solvent.
6: The dried extract was used for further analysis.
