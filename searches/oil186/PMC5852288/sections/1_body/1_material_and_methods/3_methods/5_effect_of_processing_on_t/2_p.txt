0: The effect of processing on the total phenolic content of cocoa beans was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu colorimetric method, as described by Gao et al .[15].
1: In a test tube of 5 mL volume, 20 l of a 2 mg/mL extract solution of cocoa beans was added, followed by the FolinCiocalteu reagent (0.2 mL) and distilled water (2 mL).
2: After 3 min incubation of the solution mixture at room temperature, 1 mL of 20% sodium carbonate solution was added and the mixture re-incubated for 20 min under the same conditions.
3: The absorbance of the resulting blue-coloured solution was measured at 765 nm using a spectrophotometer.
4: The total phenolic content of the extract was calculated from the gallic acid standard curve, and expressed as milligrams equivalents gallic acid per gram of extract.
