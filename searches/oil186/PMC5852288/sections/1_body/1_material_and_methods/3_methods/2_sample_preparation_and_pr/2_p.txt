0: Freshly fermented cocoa beans (4 Kg) were divided into two different groups (G1 and G2).
1: The first group (G1) was dried in an electric air-dried oven at 45 C for a period of 48 h. The dried beans were then divided into 05 sub-groups of 200 g each (SG0, SG1, SG2, SG3 and SG4).
2: SG1 and SG2 samples were traditionally roasted in cooking pot by continuous stirring for 5 and 10 minutes respectively, and were affected the codes  DTRCB 5min and  DTRCB 10 min respectively.
3: The temperature between the heat source and cooking pot was ranged between 200220 C. SG3 and SG4 were also roasted, but in the oven at 180 C for a period of 5 and 10 minutes respectively, and were affected the codes  DORCB 5 min and  DORCB 10 min respectively.
4: SG0 served as dried control and was coded  DCB.
5: G2 was extracted fresh and served as unprocessed control and was coded  FCB.
