0: The proximate composition of  Theobroma cacao beans was determined by evaluating the following parameters: Moisture, fat, ash and protein contents, using the standard methods described by AOAC  [20].
1: The moisture content was evaluated by drying cocoa beans in the oven at 103 C until constant weight, according to the AOAC method 925.40  [20].
2: The ash content was obtained by incineration of the beans at 550 C, following the AOAC procedure 924.05  [20].
3: The Nitrogen (N) content was determined using the micro-Kjeldahl, as described in the AOAC procedure 984.13.
4: The protein content was then calculated as N x 6.25.
5: The lipid contain was determined on a Soxhlet apparatus using hexane, following the AOAC 963.15 method  [20].
6: The total carbohydrate content was determined by difference as reported by Onyeike et al .[21].
7: This technique involves adding the total values of crude fat, proteins, moisture and ash constituents of the sample and subtracting it from 100.
8: All samples were analyzed in triplicate.
