0: During roasting, flavor precursors that are developed during fermentation interact to produce the desired chocolate flavor, which are formed between amino acids and sugars through Maillard reaction [ 5,  6].
1: Cocoa beans that are not roasted have bitter, acidic, astringent and nutty flavor.
2: By roasting the cocoa beans, acidity is decreased by reducing the concentration of volatile acids  [7].
3: However, processing may also cause chemical changes that may decrease the nutritional value and the antioxidant property of the beans.
4: This can negatively affect the potential health benefits arising from the consumption of cocoa beans.
5: For example, high processing temperature can promote lipid oxidation and non-enzymatic browning, which have the property to decrease the nutritional value of foods by causing a loss of essential fatty acids, essential aminoacids and digestible carbohydrates.
6: They also lead to the destruction of vitamins and the reduction of protein digestibility  [8].
7: Besides affecting the nutritional and organoleptic properties of the beans and final products, they may generate toxic compounds which are harmful for the consumers  [9].
