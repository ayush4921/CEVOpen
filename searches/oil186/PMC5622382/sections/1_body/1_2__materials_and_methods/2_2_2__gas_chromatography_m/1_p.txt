0: The leaf essential oil samples of  Salvia officinalis were analyzed by GC-MS using an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph coupled to an Agilent 5973 mass selective detector (MSD), operated in the electron impact mode with electron energy = 70 eV, a scan range of 40400 amu, a scan rate of 3.99 scans/sec, and operated through an Agilent ChemStation data system.
1: The GC column was an HP-5 ms fused silica capillary column with a (5% phenyl)-polydimethylsiloxane stationary phase, a film thickness of 0.25 m, a length of 30 m, and an internal diameter of 0.25 mm.
2: The carrier gas was helium with a column head pressure of 92.4 kPa and a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min.
3: The inlet temperature was 250 C and the interface temperature was 280 C. The GC oven temperature was programmed, 60 C initial temperature, which was held for 5 min, temperature increased at a rate of 3 C/min up to 280 C. Solutions of essential oils (1% in CH 2Cl 2) were prepared and 1-L injections were carried out using a splitless mode.
4: Identification of the oil components was based on their retention indices determined by reference to a homologous series of  n-alkanes, and by comparison of their mass spectral fragmentation patterns with those reported in the literature [ 13], and stored in our in-house MS library.
