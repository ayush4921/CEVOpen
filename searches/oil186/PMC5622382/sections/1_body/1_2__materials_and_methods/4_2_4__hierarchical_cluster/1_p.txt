0: A total of 185  S. officinalis leaf essential oil compositions from the published literature [ 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66], as well as the three compositions from this study were treated as operational taxonomic units (OTUs).
1: The percentage composition of 26 major essential oil components (-pinene, camphene -pinene, myrcene, -phellandrene,  p-cymene, limonene, 1,8-cineole, ( E)--ocimene, -terpinene, -thujone, -thujone, camphor, borneol, -terpineol, bornyl acetate, -terpinyl acetate, -caryophyllene, aromadendrene, -humulene, viridiflorene, viridiflorol, humulene epoxide II, pimaradiene, manool, and sclareol) was used to determine the compositional associations of the various  S. officinalis essential oil samples by agglomerative hierarchical cluster (AHC) analysis using the XLSTAT software, version 2015.4.01.
2: Pearson correlation was selected as a measure of similarity, and the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic average (UPGMA) was used for cluster definition.
