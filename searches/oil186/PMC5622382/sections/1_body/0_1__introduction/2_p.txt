0: Caution should be exercised in using sage essential oil.
1: The oil contains large concentrations of -thujone, which was thought to have been the hallucinogenic constituent of absinthe and the cause of absinthism.
2: This, however, has been shown to be false [ 4].
3: Nevertheless, high doses of -thujone causes convulsions by way of blocking -aminobutyric acid (GABA)-gated chloride channels [ 5, 6], and chronic exposure can lead to neurotoxicity [ 7, 8] and carcinogenicity [ 9].
4: Use of the herb itself is safe, however; it has been estimated that between 2 and 20 cups of sage tea would be required to reach the acceptable daily intake of thujone [ 10].
5: Additionally, thujone has shown a low affinity for cannabinoid receptors, but failed to show cannabinoid receptor agonism [ 11].
6: -Thujone has also been shown to reduce 5-HT 3 (ligand-gated ion channel serotonin) receptor activity [ 12].
7: In this work, we have characterized two commercial sage essential oils as well as an essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation of sage leaves grown in Mexico.
8: In addition, a cluster analysis has been carried out to place the different chemotypes of sage oil in perspective.
