0: Ten microliters of either oil was diluted in 4.990 ml of hexane and vortexed.
1: Ten microliters of this solution were again mixed with 990 l of hexane and vortexed: 1 l samples of this mixture were analyzed by a Thermo Scientific ISQ QD mass selective detector interfaced with a Thermo Scientific Trace 1300 gas chromatography (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA).
2: Inlet temperatures were maintained at 200C and samples were injected in splitless mode.
3: A 30-m DB-5 capillary column (0.25 mm I.D., 0.25 m film thickness; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was employed.
4: Helium, the carrier gas, was set at constant pressure (6 psi) and injector temperature was set at 280C.
5: Oven temperature was increased from 50 to 280C at 10C/min.
6: The NIST mass spectral library on the MS data system was used for identification.
