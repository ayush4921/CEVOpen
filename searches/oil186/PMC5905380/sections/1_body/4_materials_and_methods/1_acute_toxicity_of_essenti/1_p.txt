0: Bioassays were conducted using field-collected samples of  Cx.
1: pipiens and  Cx.
2: restuans from Peoria, IL.
3: Culex egg rafts were collected using ovitraps baited with grass infusion prepared by fermenting approximately 500 g of fresh grass clippings in 160 liters of tap water for 5 d ( Reiter 1986).
4: Egg rafts from multiple locations were hatched individually in 300 ml of deionized (DI) water held in tripour beakers and supplemented with 0.1 g of Tetramin fish food (Spectrum Brands Inc., Blacksburg, VA).
5: The containers were maintained at 26C, 70% relative humidity, and 10:14 light: dark cycle.
6: At first instar stage, a single larva from each container was identified either as  Cx.
7: pipiens or  Cx.
8: restuans based on the presence of a clear scale anterior to the sclerotized egg-breaker which is lacking in  Cx.
9: pipiens but present in  Cx.
10: restuans ( Crabtree et al.
11: 1995).
12: The species identity was further confirmed at the third instar stage based on the arrangement and morphology of setae on the siphon.
13: For each species, late third instar larvae from all locations were pooled for use in bioassays.
