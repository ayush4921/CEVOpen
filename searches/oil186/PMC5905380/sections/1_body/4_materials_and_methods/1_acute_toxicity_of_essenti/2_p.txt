0: Twenty late third instar larvae of either  Cx.
1: pipiens or  Cx.
2: restuans were added into 120 ml of DI water held in 400-ml tripour beakers.
3: Treatments included garlic essential oil, asafoetida essential oil purchased from New Directions Aromatics (Mississauga, Ontario Canada), a combination of the two essential oils, and allyl disulfide (80%, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), which was one of the major constituents of garlic essential oil and a minor constituent of asafoetida essential oil ( Table 1).
4: The two essential oils were extracted through steam distillation of bulbs (garlic) and stem and roots (asafoetida) originating from India.
5: Each treatment was tested at 10 concentrations ranging from 2 to 20 ppm.
6: A control group received 20 l of absolute ethanol without oil treatment.
7: The stock solution for each essential oil (100,000 ppm) was prepared by mixing 900 l of absolute ethanol with 100 l of the target essential oil.
8: The stock solution for oil combination treatment was prepared by mixing 50 l garlic essential oil with 50 l of asafoetida essential oil and 900 l of absolute ethanol.
9: The experiment was replicated three times for a total of 246 containers.
10: The containers were held at room temperature at 10:14 light: dark cycle and the total number of larvae surviving 24 h post-treatment were counted and recorded.
