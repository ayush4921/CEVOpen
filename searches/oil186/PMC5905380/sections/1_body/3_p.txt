0: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the individual and combined effects of garlic ( Allium sativum L.) and asafoetida ( Ferula asafoetida L.) essential oils against larvae of  Culex pipiens and  Culex restuans, the primary vectors of West Nile virus (WNV) in northeastern United States.
1: The ovicidal potential of the two essential oils against the two mosquito species was also assessed.
2: Both mosquito species occur in large numbers in urban ecosystems where they colonize and develop in thousands of storm water catch basins that are intended for storm water management ( Harbison et al.
3: 2017).
4: Although the larvicidal activity of garlic essential oil against mosquitoes has been documented before, it remains unknown how this oil may interact with other essential oils.
5: In addition, the biological activity of asafoetida essential oil against mosquitoes remains poorly understood.
6: The results of our study show that essential oils of these plants show promise for development as ovicides and larvicides.
