1: One of the key strategies for controlling these diseases involves the use of synthetic insecticides targeting both larval and adult stages of the primary vectors.
2: Although this strategy has helped avert thousands of deaths related to mosquito-borne diseases, the rapid emergence of mosquito resistance to these chemicals and the ecological and public health risks posed by these chemicals has created an immediate need for alternative vector control products ( Brogdon and McAllister 1998,  Corbel et al.
