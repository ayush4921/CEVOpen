0: In many parts of the world, botanical insecticides were commonly used to control insects of agricultural and public health significance from ancient times ( Isman 2006) until the practice was pushed into the periphery in the mid-1930s and 1950s when the major classes of synthetic insecticides were discovered.
1: However, it is now being promoted as an attractive alternative to synthetic insecticides.
2: Among plant-derived compounds, essential oils have shown great potential for vector control because they are relatively easy to obtain, have low mammalian toxicity, degrade quickly in soil and water ( Isman 2000), and elicit a variety of biological activities in mosquitoes ranging from ovicidal, larvicidal, and adulticidal effects to oviposition deterrent, feeding deterrent, and repellent effects ( Chauhan et al.

9: Unfortunately, the commercial market for these oils has lagged behind due to a myriad of factors, among them their inferior performance relative to synthetic insecticides and availability of other products with low environmental impact such as  Bacillus thuringiensis var israelensis and  Lysinibacillus sphaericus.
10: These microbe-based products have a proven efficacy in mosquito control but in the long term, mosquitoes can develop resistance to them ( Mulla et al.
11: 2003,  Stalinski et al.
12: 2014).
13: In this context, the discovery and development of new vector control products remain critical.
