0: In addition, media from wells with fungi showing no visible growth were further cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and from wells with bacteria showing no visible growth on Muller-Hinton agar (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) to determine the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), respectively.
1: MFCs and MBCs were determined as the lowest concentration yielding no more than 4 colonies, which corresponds to a mortality of 98% of the microorganisms in the initial inoculums.
