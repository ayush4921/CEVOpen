0: The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using the broth microdilution method recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute with some modifications.
1: 12,  13 Briefly, for determination of antifungal activities, serial dilutions of the essential oil (0.031-128 L/mL) were prepared in 96-well microtiter plates using RPMI-1640 media (Sigma, St Louis, MO) buffered with MOPS (Sigma).
2: To determine the antibacterial activities, serial dilutions of the compounds (0.031-128 L/mL) were prepared in Muller-Hinton media (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).
3: For yeasts and bacteria, stock inoculums were prepared by suspending 3 colonies of the examined microorganisms in 5 mL sterile 0.85% NaCl, and adjusting the turbidity of the inoculums to 0.5 McFarland standards at 630 nm wavelength (this yields stock suspension of 1-5  10 6 CFU/mL for yeasts and 1-1.5  10 8 CFU/mL for bacteria).
4: Working suspension was prepared by making a 1/1000 dilution of the stock suspension with RPMI or Muller-Hintonbroth for yeasts and bacteria, respectively.
5: To each well of the microtiter plates, 0.1 mL of the working inoculums was added and the plates were incubated in a humid atmosphere at 30C for 24 to 48 hours (fungi) or at 37C for 24 hours (bacteria).
6: Two hundred microliters of un-inoculated medium was included as a sterility control (blank).
7: In addition, growth controls (medium with inoculums but without the essential oil) were also included.
8: The growth in each well was compared with that of the growth control well.
9: MICs were visually determined and defined as the lowest concentration of the compounds produced 50% and 95% growth inhibition for fungi and 95% growth reduction for bacteria compared with the growth control wells.
10: Each experiment was performed in triplicate.
