0: The antifungal activities of the essential oils against 15 standard strains of fungi, including  Candida albicans (ATCC 5982, 1912, 562, 1905, 1949, 10261),  Candida tropicalis (ATCC 750),  Candida krusei (ATCC 6258),  Candida glabrata (ATCC 863, 2192, 2175, 6144),  Candida dubliniensis (CBS 8501, ATCC 8500), and  Candida parapsilosis (ATCC 4344), were determined.
1: In addition, the antifungal activities of the essential oil against 24 clinical isolates of yeasts identified by polymerase chain reactionrestriction fragment length polymorphism were also examined.
2: The antifungal susceptibility of clinical isolates of the tested fungi were examined by microdilution and disk diffusion methods, and fluconazole was used as positive control in the same experimental conditions.
3: The antibacterial activities of the essential oil against standard species of  Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923),  Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC11700),  Escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic  Escherichia coli (ATCC 43894),  Streptococcus mutans (ATCC 35668),  Streptococcus pneumonia (ATCC 33400),  Streptococcus pyogenes (ATCC 8668),  Salmonella enterica (ATCC 14028),  Shigella flexneri (NCTC 8516), and clinical isolates  Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium,  Enterococcus faecalis,  Escherichia coli, and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected from the Dr Faghihi Hospital (Shiraz, Iran) were also determined in this study.
