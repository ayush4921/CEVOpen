0: Essential oil analysis was performed using gas chromatography equipped with a mass spectrometer detector (Agilent Technologies Model 5975 C).
1: The gas chromatograph was also provided a capillary column 60 m  0.25 mm id, film thickness 0.25 mm.
2: The oven program was as follows: temperature increase from 60C at a rate of 5C/min up to 250C and finally held for 10 minutes.
3: The transfer line temperature was 250C.
4: Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.1 mL/min with a split ratio equal to 1/50.
5: The quadrupole mass spectrometer was scanned over 35 to 465 amu with an ionizing voltage of 70 eV and an ionization current of 150 mA.
