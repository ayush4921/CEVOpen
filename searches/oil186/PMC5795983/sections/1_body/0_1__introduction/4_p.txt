0: Breast cancer has become a great concern, as it is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths for women worldwide [ 29].
1: According to the World Health Organization, more than one million cases of breast cancer are reported worldwide annually [ 30].
2: High cost, increasing drug resistance, and side effects of current therapeutic approaches are forcing researchers to explore alternative procedures as options to find new chemical entities for cancer treatments [ 31].
3: Likewise, microbial pathogens, such as bacteria and fungi, are a major cause of human disease and are among the most concerning threats to public health due to drug-resistant strains [ 32, 33].
4: A review estimated that continued rise in microbial resistance could lead to 10 million deaths every year by 2050 [ 34].
5: Thus, there is a need for the development of new drugs and, due to broad biological action, essential oils or their isolated compounds can inspire novel discoveries.
6: Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro cytotoxic, antifungal and antibacterial activities of essential oils from the leaves of  B. salicifolius, and to identify their main chemical constituents.
