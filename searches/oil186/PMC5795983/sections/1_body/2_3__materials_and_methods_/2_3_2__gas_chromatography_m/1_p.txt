0: Essential oils from  B. salicifolius leaves were analyzed using a gas chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer, model FOCUS ISQ 230ST (Thermo Scientific, Austin, TX, USA), equipped with a TraceGOLD TG-5MS capillary column (Thermo Scientific, 30 m  0.25 mm  0.25 m film thickness).
1: The carrier gas was helium, at a flow rate of 1 mLmin 1.
2: Injector and detector temperatures were 220 C and 240 C, respectively; the injection volume was 1 L and split ratio was 1:20.
3: The oven temperature was programmed from 60 C to 246 C, at 3 C/min.
4: The electron impact energy was set at 70 eV and fragments from 40 to 415  m/ z were collected [ 37].
