0: A sample of the essential oil was solubilized in methanol (Synth, Sao Paulo, Brazil) and diluted in supplemented Dulbeccos Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Sigma-Aldrich) to form a stock solution of 640 gmL 1.
1: Cell viability was tested with cell lines from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA).
2: MCF-7 (human metastatic adenocarcinoma-estrogen-receptor positive; ATCC HTB-22) and MDA-MB-231 (human metastatic adenocarcinoma-estrogen-receptor negative; ATCC HTB-26) breast cancer cell lines, and the MCF-10A (human mammary epithelial cells; ATCC CRL-10317) normal breast cell line, were selected for cytotoxicity assays.
3: A solution containing 1  10 4 cells in 100 L of supplemented DMEM was pipetted into each well and the plate was incubated overnight at 37 C, with a humidified atmosphere and 5% CO 2, allowing cell adhesion in wells.
4: Once attached and after removal of the culture medium, the stock solution of essential oil was added to the microplate and a serial dilution was performed to achieve concentrations ranging from 4 to 512 gmL 1.
5: For this analysis, the controls of cell growth, solvent (methanol 3%), samples and negative control (100% lysed cells) were performed.
6: Microplates were incubated for 48 h at 37 C with a humidified atmosphere and 5% CO 2.
7: Next, a revealing solution of resazurin (3 mM) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was added to each well [ 63] and the plate was incubated again for 24 h under the same conditions.
8: Readings of absorbance at 595 nm were performed using a Multiskan GO Microplate Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).
9: Assays were performed in six replicates and the results of absorbance were calculated according to the growth control.
10: The cytotoxic concentration at which 50% of the cells are viable (CC 50) was calculated by a dose-response graph of nonlinear regression.
