0: Experiments were performed with standard strains from ATCC and clinical isolates ( n = 6) obtained from the Laboratory of Microbiology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Sao Paulo State University (UNESP-Botucatu Campus).
1: The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the use of isolated microorganisms was approved by the Institutional Committee on Human Research (number 47186415.0.0000.5411-8 March, 2015), according to the ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, and the strains were submitted to biochemical tests for phenotypic confirmation of the species [ 67].
2: The following microorganisms were used: methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (ATCC 33591), methicillin-sensitive  Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (ATCC 25923),  Escherichia coli (ATCC 43895) and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853).
3: Susceptibility assays were performed according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [ 68] on 96-well microplates (Costar) with Mueller Hinton broth (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA) culture medium.
4: The sample of essential oil was dissolved in DMSO (Synth, 160,000 gmL 1) and serial dilution was performed to achieve concentrations ranging from 2.44 to 5000 gmL 1.
5: The final DMSO concentration was 3% ( v/ v).
6: Bacterial strains were grown (37 C for 1824 h) in brain heart infusion (BHI; Difco) and, after standardization by 0.5 McFarland scale, were inoculated (around 10 5 cfumL 1) in wells at concentrations previously prepared.
7: After incubation (37 C for 1824 h), the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each strain was visually recorded after addition of 50 L of resazurin (0.01%) in respective wells.
8: Polymyxin B (Latinofarma, Cotia, Brazil) was used as a positive control for Gram-negative bacteria and Cephalothin (Latinofarma) for Gram-positive bacteria.
9: Controls of sterility of the broth, culture control (inoculum), essential oil and DMSO (3%) were performed.
