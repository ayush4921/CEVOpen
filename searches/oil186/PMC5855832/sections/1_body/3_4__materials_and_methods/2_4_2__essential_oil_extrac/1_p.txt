0: A total of 100 g clove was subjected to hydro-distillation for 3 h with 600 mL distilled water using a Clevenger-type apparatus modified: the hydrosol was collected in a separator funnel (1 L) so that the heavy essential oil was decanted to the bottom of the flask and collected.
1: Another funnel of distilled water was used to add water to the flask containing the plant material during boiling.
2: The essential oil obtained was collected and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and stored in a refrigerator at 45 C prior to analysis.
