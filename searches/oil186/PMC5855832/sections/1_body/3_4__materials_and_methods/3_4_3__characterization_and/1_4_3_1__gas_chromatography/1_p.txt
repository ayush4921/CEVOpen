0: The isolated oil was diluted with hexane (dilution ratio 1:10), and 1 mL was sampled for the gas chromatographic analysis.
1: Trace gas chromatograph (GC) (ULTRA S/N 20062969, Thermo Fischer, Villebon-sur-Yvette, France) that is equipped with HP-5MS non polar fused silica capillary column (60 m  0.32 mm, film thickness 0.25 mm) was used.
2: Operating conditions: oven temperature program from 50 C (2 min) to 280 C at 5 C/min and the final temperature kept for 10 min; 2 split mode ratio 1:20; carrier gas Azoth (N), flow rate 1 mL/min; temperature of injector and detector (flame ionization detector) were fixed at 250 C and 280 C, respectively.
