0: The antioxidant capacity was evaluated by the phosphomolybdenum method.
1: Syzygium aromaticum essential oil prepared in ethanol (25 L) or Argan oil (25 L) were mixed with 1 mL of reagent solution (6 M sulfuric acid, 28 mM sodium phosphate and 4 mM ammonium molybdate).
2: After 90 min of incubation in a water bath at 95 C the absorbance of the solution was measured at 695 nm against blank, the tests were made in triplicate, and quercetine was used as reference [ 50].
