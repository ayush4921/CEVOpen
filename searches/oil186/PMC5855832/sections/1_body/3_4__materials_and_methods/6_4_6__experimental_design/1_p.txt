0: To evaluate the protective effect of Argan oil or  Syzygium aromaticum essential oil prepared in Argan oil, the rats were randomly divided into six groups: Group 1: received (10 mL/kg/bw) of distilled water, Group 2: received  Syzygium aromaticum essential oil prepared in Argan oil (100 mg/kg/bw), Group 3: received Argan oil (10 mL/kg/bw), group 4: received 1% of H 2O 2 (10 mL/kg/bw) and (10 mL/kg/bw) of distilled water, Group 5: received 1% of H 2O 2 (10 mL/kg/bw) and  Syzygium aromaticum essential oil prepared in Argan oil (100 mg/kg/bw), and Group 6: received H 2O 2 (10 mL/kg/bw) and Argan oil (10 mL/kg/bw).
1: The interventions were delivered daily by gavage for 21 days.
2: Blood sample was collected from each rat on day 21 and body weight was measured.
3: The kidney, brain, and liver of each rat were removed, weighted and were immediately fixed in formalin solution at (10%).
