0: Free radicals are naturally present in the living organism, and they include reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) [ 1].
1: They are produced during metabolism of energy in the cell as a result of the reduction of oxygen with one electron which forms superoxide anion (O 2) and with 2 or 3 electrons which forms H 2O 2 by the action of enzymes such as oxidases and with production of hydroxyl radical (OH ).
2: Furthermore, nitric oxide (NO) with anionic superoxide (O 2) gives peroxynitrite (ONOO ), which is RNS [ 2].Pollutions of air and water, toxins, drugs, heavy metals, pesticides, and cigarette smoke play an important role in the production of ROS [ 3].
