0: The identification of the essential oil components was carried out by high-resolution gas chromatography analysis, in the analytical laboratory, at Tropical Pesticides Research Institute (TPRI)-Arusha.
1: The injection volume was 2 l composed of 1.6 l of a solution of essential oil (40 g/ml) and 0.4 l of a solution of hydrocarbon series of C 7-C, as an internal standard, both in n-hexanes as a solvent.
2: The gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry-GC-MS-system used consisted of a gas chromatograph, Thermo Scientific Ultra GC coupled to a mass spectrometer, Thermo Scientific .
3: The fused silica capillary column used was a DB-5 J & W Scientific (30 m  0.25 mm  0.25 mm).
4: Helium was the carrier gas, and the column temperature program was increased by 3 C per minute between 60 and 240 C. The mass spectra were obtained at 70 eV at a scan rate of 0.84 scans/s and at the range m/z 40500.
5: The retention times of sample components and a mixture of n-alkanes from C 7-C, coinjected into the GC-MS system under the same temperature program was used for the calculation of the Arithmetic Retention Index - AI - and the Kovats Retention Index (KI) [ 27].
6: Identification of components was based on several methods: the calculated AI and KI and mass spectra [ 28].
