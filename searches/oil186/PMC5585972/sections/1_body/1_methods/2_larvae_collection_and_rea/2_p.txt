0: Insectary reared third instars  An.
1: gambiae  ( s.s.) (Kisumu strain - insecticide susceptible strain) larvae and third-instar  An.
2: arabiensis field population larvae (insecticides tolerant population) were tested against essential oils in different concentrations.
3: Larvae collected from wild population showed tolerance to pyrethroids and DDT in previous studies comprised of 91%  An.
4: arabiensis and the rest of  An.
5: gambiae ( s.s.) and  An.
6: funestus [ 24].
7: The main source of insecticide resistance in this study site is the use of different insecticide classes with different mixtures in cultivating crops and the wide coverage of LLINs in the area [ 24].
