0: Twenty third-instar larvae were placed in plastic cups containing distilled water for 1 h to reduce the stress.
1: Thereafter 0.2 ml of each of the stock solution was added to their respective cups to make test solutions at concentrations ranging from 800, 400, 200, 100 and 50 g/ml in their respective plastic cups containing the 20 test larvae each, which were used for the larvicidal tests.
2: A negative control containing 19.8 ml of distilled water and 0.2 ml acetone with twenty third-instar mosquito larvae was also prepared.
3: Each test comprised of four replicates of five concentrations (800, 400, 200, 100 and 50 g/ml).
4: Each sample of the essential oil was tested three times on different days in the four replicates.
5: Acetone was used to solubilize the essential oil in the water.
6: During the testing time, after 24 h of monitoring mosquito larvae, they were provided with yeast powder and monitored for 72 h.
