0: Vector-borne diseases remain a major public health concern in tropical areas [ 1].
1: Poor drainage systems in urban areas, especially during rainy seasons, and irrigation ditches in farmland provide abundant mosquito breeding places [ 1 3].
2: Tanzania spends a low share of its gross domestic product (7.2%) on health, with a meagre public expenditure of 39% for health costs [ 4].
3: Vector-borne diseases affecting people in Tanzania are malaria, filariasis, dengue, chikungunya and other arboviruses [ 5].
4: Malaria remains the deadliest vector-borne disease despite long-term control efforts [ 6].
5: Among the mosquito-borne vectors,  Ae.
6: aegypti (L.), a vector of dengue fever, is prevalent in the tropics and sub-tropics and is closely associated with human habitats outside its native range of Africa [ 7].
7: Culex pipiens pallens (Coquillett) is a vector of the western Nile virus and is distributed throughout Africa, the Middle East and Asia [ 8].
8: The complex sibling species of  An.
9: gambiae which transmit malaria worldwide have been described [ 9].
10: All of these vector-borne diseases occur mainly in tropical countries where more than two billion people live in endemic regions [ 10].
11: The approaches to combating vector-borne diseases relies on the interruption of the disease transmission cycle by either targeting the adult or larvae through spraying breeding sites or targeting adults using insecticides [ 11].
12: Synthetic pesticides have been extensively used for mosquito control by either killing the vectors, preventing adult mosquitoes from biting humans or by killing mosquito larvae at breeding sites [ 12,  13].
13: However, the development of resistance to different classes of synthetic insecticides such as pyrethroids, organophosphates, organochlorides and carbamates has drawn attention to the search of alternative methods of control [ 14].
14: The toxicity of the available chemical insecticides, their high operational cost and the subsequent environmental pollution have caused the need for developing alternative approaches to control vector-borne diseases [ 15].
15: Plant extracts with proven mosquito control potential can be used in place of synthetic insecticides, either as insecticides for killing larvae or adult mosquitoes or as repellents for protection against mosquito bites.
16: Amongst them, essential oils have gained a special interest due to their insecticidal properties [ 16] andin recent years, have proved to be potentially useful sources of bioactive compounds against mosquito larvae [ 17] .
17: Essential oils are composed of isoprenoid compounds, mainly monoterpene carriers of smell in the aromatic plants, such as sesquiterpenes alcohols identified from  Chamaecyparis obtusa leaf oil and various monoterpene components derived from  Thuja orientalis [ 18].
