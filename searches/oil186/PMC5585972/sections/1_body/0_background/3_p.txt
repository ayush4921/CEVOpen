0: Apart from essential oils, extracts prepared from Tanzanian plants have been evaluated for their larvicidal activity.
1: For instance, extracts from  Annona muricata,  Annona senegalensis and  Annona squamosa were active against  Culex quinquefasciatus, which demonstrated that extracts of  Annona species grown in Tanzania could be potential anti-mosquito agents [ 20].
2: In spite of the anti-mosquito activities of several studied species of plants, relatively little work has been done on the larvicidal activities of essential oils extracted from spices, such as clove and cinnamon.
3: A recent study carried out in Nigeria assessed the activity of clove essential oils against  Ae.
4: aegypti and  Cx.
5: quinquefasciatus and achieved over 85% larval mortality within 24-hourspost-exposure [ 21].
6: Meanwhile, in Thailand, lemongrass and clove essential oils were effective in causing mortality for all larval stages of  An.
7: dirus and  Ae.
8: aegypti [ 22].
