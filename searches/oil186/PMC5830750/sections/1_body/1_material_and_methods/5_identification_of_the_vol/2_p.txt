0: GC analysis was carried out on an Agilent Technoloies-7890A gas chromatograph with a split/splitless injector (280 C), split ratio of 1 : 50 and a flame ionization detector (290 C).
1: Nitrogen was used as carrier gas (1 ml min 1) and the capillary column used was a DB-5 (30 m   0.32  mm, film thickness 0.25 m).
2: The column oven temperature was kept at 60C for 3  min and heated to 210C with a 3C min 1 rate, then increased to 240C with 20 C min 1 rate and the final temperature held for 8.5  min.
3: Relative percentage amounts were calculated from the peak area without the use of correction factors.
