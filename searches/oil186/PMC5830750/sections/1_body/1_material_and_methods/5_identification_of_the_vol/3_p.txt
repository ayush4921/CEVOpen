0: GC-MS analysis was performed on an Agilent Technoloies-7890A equipped with a HP-5MS capillary column (30 m   0.25  mm, film thickness 0.25 m).
1: The column temperature was kept at 60 C for 3  min and programmed to 210C at a rate of 3C min 1, heated to 240C with 20C min 1 and held for 8.5  min.
2: The injector and GC/MS interface line were maintained at 280C.
3: Helium was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1.The ionization voltage was 70  eV and the ion source temperature was 230C.
4: The mass range ( m/z) was 50480.
5: The retention indices for all the components were calculated as described by Van den Dool and Kratz [ 36] using  n-alkanes as a standard.
6: The compounds were identified by comparison retention indices (RI, DB5) with data reported in the literature and by comparison of their mass spectra with the Wiley GC/MS library, Adams library, mass finder 2.1 library data published MS [ 37].
