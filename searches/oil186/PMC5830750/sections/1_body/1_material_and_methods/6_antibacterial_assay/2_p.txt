0: The antibacterial activities of the essential oils of  E. ilicifolius were determined by measuring the growth inhibitory zones against three Gram-positive and three Gram-negative bacteria.
1: The Gram-positive bacteria included  Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212),  Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923),  Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228) and Gram-negative bacteria included  Proteus mirabilis (ATCC 43071),  Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853).
2: The bacteria were obtained from the Research Center of Science and Industry, Tehran, Iran.
3: The microorganisms (obtained from enrichment culture with a bacterial concentration 1.8  10 6 of the microorganisms in 1 ml of Mueller-Hinton broth (Merck, Germany), incubated at 37C for 24  h were cultured on Mueller-Hinton agar (Merck, Germany, medium).
4: After drilling, 50 l of solutions with effective concentration in DMSO (Merck, Germany) were poured in each disc.
5: After incubation, the inhibition zone diameter was read by a ruler [ 38].
