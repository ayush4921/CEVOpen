0: Eight-week-old male Swiss albino mice were obtained from Pasteur Institute of Ho Chi Minh City, weighing approximately 3032 g. The animals were randomly divided into polycarbonate cages with 4 mice for each cage.
1: They were housed under standard husbandry conditions with 12 h light-dark cycle (8:0020:00) for at least 1 week to acclimate with laboratory environment.
2: They were supplied ad libitum with standard chow and distilled water.
3: The experimental procedure was strictly in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki (1964).
4: Briefly, twelve healthy mice were randomly divided into 3 groups with 4 mice per group and treated as the protocol of Tavares Pereira et al.
5: (2012) with some modifications [ 22].
6: Mice were anesthetized with diethyl ether for 3 min, then the hair on back of mice was removed using razor.
7: The dorsal proximal region was antisepsis with polyvinyl pyrrolidone iodine.
8: Thermal lesion was generated by a massive aluminum bar 10 mm in diameter preheated to 100  5C/10 min.
9: The probe was kept to contact with mouse skin for 15 sec.
10: After that, the burn wound was treated with an indicated volume of saline, tamanu oil, or diluted  C. operculatus essential oil (50  l/lesion) once per day for 20 days.
11: Tamanu oil (Inopilo, Binh Minh Pharmaceutical Joint Co. Ltd.) was used as reference treatment.
12: Diluted  C. operculatus essential oil (1% solution) was prepared by dissolving the essential oil in 0.1% DMSO and Tween 20 solution.
13: The burned area of mice was measured after 10 days and 20 days and the results were presented as square centimeter (cm 2).
