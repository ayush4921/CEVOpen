0: The antimicrobial activity of essential oil was determined by the agar diffusion method.
1: The following bacterial strains  Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, which are considered as two common opportunistic bacteria in skin and mucous membrane [ 21], were employed for screening the antimicrobial activity of  C. operculatus essential oil.
2: Briefly, the tested microorganisms (0.1 ml of 1  10 8 CFU/ml) were inoculated on LB agar.
3: Then the sterilized filter paper discs (6 mm in diameter) were impregnated with 20  L of  Cleistocalyx operculatus essential oil or tamanu oil.
4: The discs were placed in LB agar plates, after which the plates were incubated at 37C for 24 hours.
5: The commercial antibiotic discs (Gentamycin, Nam Khoa Biotek Co.) and tamanu oil (Inopilo, Binh Minh Pharmaceutical Joint Co. Ltd.) were used as positive controls.
6: The diameters of inhibition zones were measured in millimeters.
