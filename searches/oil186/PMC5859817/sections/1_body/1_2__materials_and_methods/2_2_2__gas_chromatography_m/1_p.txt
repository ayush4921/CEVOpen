0: The GC-MS analysis of the essential oil was performed at Department of Analytical Chemistry, University of Science, Vietnam National University of Ho Chi Minh City with the given protocol.
1: Briefly, chemical compositions of essential oil were analyzed on a GC-MS Aligent 6890 system equipped with a splitless mode injector and DB5MS column (30 m  0.25 mm ID, film thickness 0.25  m from Aligent Technologies, USA).
2: The GC injector temperature was set at 250C.
3: A 1 mL volume of 2,000 ppm oil solution (1 hot water: 10 methanol) was injected.
4: Helium in constant pressure was used as carrier gas at flow rate of 1.0 mL/min.
5: The oven initial temperature was maintained 60C for 1 min and heated at 10C/min until oven temperature reached 200C, and the oven was kept in this temperature for 5 min.
6: Then oven was heated at 20C/min to 280C and then kept for 1 min.
7: The temperature of transfer line was set at 280C.
8: For GC-MS analysis, an electron ionization with ionization energy of 1700 eV was used, covering a mass range from 40 to 450 mz.
9: The compounds were identified by NIST MS Search version 2.0.
