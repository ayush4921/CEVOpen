0:  Establishment of second-degree burn wound models.
1: Histological analysis showed that injury of burn wound was extended into both epidermis and dermis.
2: In normal skin section, thick squamous epithelium covered the epidermis, and both of epidermis and dermis had the normal structure with several hair follicles and sebaceous glands (a).
3: In burn wound skin section, epidermis and dermis lost their normal structure.
4: Of note, squamous epithelium layer was removed, and epidermis was necrotized.
5: Moreover, the underlying stromal tissue was swollen and congestive (b).
6: These results indicated that the second-degree burn model was successfully established in experimental mice.
7: The arrows indicated the border between the dermis and hypodermis. )
