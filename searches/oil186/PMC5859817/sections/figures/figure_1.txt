0:  GC/MS chromatogram of essential oil extracted from Cleistocalyx operculatus leaves.
1: A total of 13 compounds were identified in CLO: 6-camphenol; isopinocarveol; p-cymen-8-ol; ()-myrtenol; I-verbenone; cis-carveol; ethaneperoxoic acid, 1-cyano-4,4-dimethyl-1-phenylpentyl ethaneperoxate; (+)-carotol; caryophyllene oxide; ()-globulol; 2-(4a,8-dimethyl-2,3,4,4a,5,6-hexahydronaphthalen-2-yl)propan-1-; and longipinocarvone.
2: Among them, many bioactive compounds identified in CLO exhibited antimicrobial and/or anti-inflammatory activities.
3: This finding supports the idea of using Cleistocalyx operculatus essential oil as topical agent for treatment of burn wound, at least to prevent the infection and sepsis. )
