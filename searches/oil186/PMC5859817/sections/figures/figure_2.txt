0:  Antimicrobial activity of C. operculatus essential oil.
1: Both CLO and commercial tamanu oil exhibited antibacterial activity against S. aureus whereas they did not inhibit the growth of P. aeruginosa.
2: The diameter of inhibition zones against S. aureus of gentamicin (positive control) was highest (11.37  0.15 mm), followed by tamanu oil (9.03  0.31 mm) and CLO (7.17  0.12 mm).
3: On the contrary, only gentamicin showed the antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa (12.07  0.15 mm); both tamanu oil and CLO did not affect the growth of P. aeruginosa.
4: This finding implies the potential use of CLO as anti-infective agent for burn wound treatment.
5: The experiments were triplicated, and results were presented as mean  standard deviation. )
