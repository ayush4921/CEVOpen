0: GC Analysis: Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis A GC/MS.
1: ITMS Varian 4000 GCMS/MS (Varian, USA) equipped with a CP-8410 auto-injector and a 30 m  0.25 mm i.d.
2: VF-5 ms column (Varian, USA), film thickness 0.25 m, was used; carrier gas He at a rate of 0.5 ml/min; injector and detector temperature 250 and 200 C, respectively; split ratio 1:50; injection volume 5 l. A temperature gradient was applied (50 C for 1 min, then incremented by 4 C/min to 250 C, then held at 250 C for 10 min); ionization energy 70 eV; mass range 40870 Da; scan time 0.80 s. The oil obtained was collected in dark glass vessels, dried using dehydrated sodium sulfate and stored at below  10 C until chromatographic determination.
