0: Prototheca zopfii isolates were obtained from a range of milk samples taken from cows with mastitis in the Department of Animal and Environmental Hygiene, University of Life Sciences in Lublin.
1: P. zopfii strains were identified using standard microbiological methods: They were cultured in Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (bioMerieux, Poland), incubated for 4872 h at 37 C and then Gram-stained.
2: Identification was performed using routine culture, macro- and microscopic morphological characterization and API 20C AUX (bioMerieux, Poland) [ 16 19].
3: Clotrimazole susceptibility testing using antibiotic disks (clotrimazole 50 g) (Bio-Rad) allowed rapid differentiation of  P. wickerhamii from  P. zopfii [ 20].
