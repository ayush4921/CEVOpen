0: The tested strains of  P. zopfii were cultured in a Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) bioMerieux and incubated for 48 h under aerobic conditions at 37 C. From the inoculum, suspensions of algae were prepared in physiological saline (0.85%) with an optical density of 0.5 McFarland, which is approximately equal to 1  108 c.f.u./ml.
1: To determine the density of the suspension, a Den-1B McFarland Densitometer (BioSan) was used.
