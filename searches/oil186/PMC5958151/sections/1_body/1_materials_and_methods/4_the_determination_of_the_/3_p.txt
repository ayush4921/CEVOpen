0: The tests were performed using sterile 96-well microtiter plates (ProfiLab, Poland).
1: The oils were diluted in DMSO.
2: For each oil, concentrations of 32 to 0.0625 l/ml were prepared in Sabouraud Dextrose Broth (Graso, Poland), with 100 l of each concentration being mixed with the same volume of algae suspension.
3: Two controls were prepared: a positive control without the essential oil and a negative control without the  Prototheca suspension.
4: Control media, containing only DMSO at the concentration used, did not inhibit the growth of strains.
5: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the test substance, i.e., its lowest concentration preventing the growth of the microorganism (no turbidity), was determined after 48-h incubation at 37 C under aerobic conditions.
6: To confirm the visually defined MIC, SDA plates were plated with 100 l dilution from the last well without turbidity and the results were read after 48 h under aerobic conditions at 37 C. All tests were performed in triplicate.
