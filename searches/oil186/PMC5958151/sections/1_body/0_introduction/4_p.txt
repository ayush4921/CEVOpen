0: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of essential oils obtained from  Thymus vulgaris L.,  Origanum vulgare L.,  Origanum majerana L.,  Mentha   piperita L. and  Allium ursinum L. against  P. zopfii strains that cause inflammation of the udder (mastitis) in cows.
1: The study used thyme, marjoram, mint [ 6,  8,  10,  11], oregano [ 6,  11,  12] and bear garlic oils [ 13,  14], which are believed to have antifungal and anti-algae effects.
