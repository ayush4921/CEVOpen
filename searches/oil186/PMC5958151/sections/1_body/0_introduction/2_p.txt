0: Prototheca zopfii is mainly responsible for infection in animals, and the most common protothecosis is mastitis.
1: The disease causes serious economic losses.
2: Infection results in reduced production and poorer quality of milk, and the infected cows are usually slaughtered.
3: The pathogen is transmitted through sick animals and the environment: drinking water, slurry, feces, the walls and floors in stalls, equipment and cups of milk [ 2].
4: A number of factors are known to promote infection, including age of cows, number of episodes, past inflammation and treatment method.
5: The cows are more vulnerable in the early lactation stage [ 2,  3].
6: Treating  Prototheca mastitis is difficult, and the applied therapy is beset by resistance, which may be caused by the presence of sporopollenin in the algal cell wall [ 2].
7: Commonly used antibacterial and antifungal agents are ineffective, despite demonstrating biological activity in vitro.
8: Despite many attempts, the use of intramammary administration of levamisole and tetramisole has failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy [ 2,  4].
