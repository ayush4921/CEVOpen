0: Table 2Advantages and disadvantages of different technologies that were most cited as green and sustainable techniques over the last 10 yearsAdvantagesDisadvantagesSolvent processingInexpensive and simplicity; allows for solvent reuseDoes not always uses benign solvents; frequently requires an evaporation/concentration step for recovery; usually demands large amounts of solvent and long extraction time; possibility of thermal degradationMicrowave processingReduced extraction time; reduced solvent usage; improved extraction yield; simple and inexpensiveNot good when either target compounds or solvents are non-polar or volatilesUltrasonicationInexpensive, simple and efficient; can reduce the operating temperature (good for thermolabile compounds); can be used with any solventIts efficiency may be linked to the nature of plant matrix; the active part of ultrasound inside the extractor is restricted to a zone located in the vicinity of the ultrasonic emitterSupercritical fluidModerate extraction temperature (good for thermolabile compounds); rapid mass transfer (larger extraction rate); solubility of a chemical in a supercritical fluid can be manipulated; can eliminate concentration process; the solutes can be separated from supercritical fluids without losing volatiles due to its extreme volatility; additional filtration or centrifugation to remove solid residue is not necessaryOnerous operating conditions
