0: An important proposal related to waste hierarchy as a framework for residue management can be seen in Fig.
1: 2 [ 14,  15], which was reformulated to include agro-industrial waste.
2: In this case, the agro-industrial waste hierarchy has a different meaning from top to bottom, since all biomass is valued as raw material.
3: Prevention is an intrinsic part of optimized processes, avoiding overproduction.
4: Therefore, the least probable option is disposal as the supply chain is designed to attend sustainable consumption, using all bio-based material generated.
5: Here, sustainable production also includes eco-efficiency, cleaner and green productivity, whereas sustainable consumption allows greener choices to be made by individuals based on eco-procurement, supply chain management, waste minimization, recycling, and resource efficiency measures.
6: Both sustainable production and consumption comprises life-cycle thinking, aiming at preventing problems shifting from one life-cycle stage to another, one geographical area or environmental compartment to another.
