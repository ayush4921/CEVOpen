0: According to the Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations [ 3], after years of progress, world hunger has increased since 2015.
1: Around 60% of the worlds starving people are from countries affected by conflict and climate change, including northeast Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, and Yemen with 20 million people, often suffering extreme climatic events such as droughts and floods.
2: Not surprisingly, some of the FAOs top priorities for the next 2 years include topics such as sustainable agriculture, climate change mitigation and adaptation, water scarcity and support of subsistence rural practices, and fisheries and forestry [ 3,  4].
3: The challenges related to this demanding context can be intensified and better understood when taking into account that the world population is expected to increase by about 30% over the next 35 years, reaching more than 9.5 billion people in 2050 and 11.2 billion in 2100 [ 5].
