0: Currently, it can be observed that global sustainability challenges are all closely interconnected, such as pollution, climate change, biodiversity loss, poverty, energy, and food security.
1: As stated by Liu et al.
2: [ 1], only holistic and disruptive approaches integrating various components of human and natural systems are effective in identifying and proposing suitable solutions for these challenges, especially those related to research, development, and innovation (RD&I) in interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary studies.
3: To exemplify this systemic view, Fig.
4: 1 illustrates the Earth surface that, based on the Dymaxion map (the Fuller Projection Map), shows the planet as a continuum without splitting any continents, seas, and oceans, where cycles are integrated through flows of matter, energy, and information [ 1,  2].
5: Here, Brazil, China, the Caribbean, and Africa interact across space, time, and organizational levels in many ways.
6: For instance, the expansion of soybean production aggravates deforestation in Brazil, but also provides food and feedstock to China.
7: The food trade between both countries also affects other areas, including the Caribbean and Africa.
8: Dust particles from the Sahara Desert, also increased due to unbalanced agricultural practices, can reach the Caribbean and have an impact on coral reefs and soil fertility, diminishing tourism in this region.
9: In addition, nutrient-rich particles from Africa can reach Brazil, improving its forest productivity.
