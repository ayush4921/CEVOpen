0: As can be noted, new generations of biorefinery combine innovative biomass resources from different origins, chemical extraction and purification and/or synthesis of biomaterials, biofuels and bioenergy via benign processes.
1: From the very beginning, the identification and quantification of all potentially high value-added compounds that could be removed from the available renewable feedstocks requires another analytical approach, also connected to green chemistry [ 20,  21].
