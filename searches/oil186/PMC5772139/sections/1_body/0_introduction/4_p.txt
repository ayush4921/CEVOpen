0: It is estimated that around 140 billion tons of biomass from the agricultural sector are generated every year in the world [ 8,  9], and a considerable part is recognized as waste and not conflicting with food availability, e.g., leaves, roots, stalks, bark, bagasse, straw residues, seeds, wood and animal residues.
1: Using alternative strategies to avoid additional losses and produce several high value-added chemicals could minimize the volume of non-renewable materials used today (i.e., roughly 50 billion tons of fossil fuels), enough to greatly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on non-sustainable resources.
2: Therefore, considering their available volume and practically low costs locally and globally, associated to rich function, structure and chemical heterogeneity, all agro-industrial waste should also be considered for their chemical and material potential, as well as a source of energy [ 10 13].
