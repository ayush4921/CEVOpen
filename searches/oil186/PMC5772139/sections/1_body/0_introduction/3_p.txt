0: As pointed out by Xia et al.
1: [ 6], the global food waste of approximately 1.3 billion tons per year is shocking in this context and, although it should be avoided or minimized, it cannot be completely prevented nowadays.
2: Primary and secondary processing generates unpreventable food supply chain waste.
3: This can be due to a number of factors along the supply chain, differing by the commodity and country in question.
4: In general terms, developing countries such as some African countries suffer the greatest loss during the early, upstream part of the primary processing, corresponding to 75% of food losses during production and postharvest.
5: Various initiatives, e.g., building better infrastructure through knowledge transfer (more efficient storage and transport technologies) and improving collaboration and market opportunities in the food supply chain could have a positive role.
6: In industrialized countries, waste occurs especially in the consumption stage, accounting for 50% of overall loss of crops in some countries of North America, Europe, and Oceania.
7: In this case, together with educational and cultural actions, other aspects such as developing legislation to make date labels more user-friendly for consumers (sell-by, best-before, and consume-by), redesigning packaging characteristics (avoiding the buy 1 get 2 offers) and retailer marketing strategies should be considered [ 7].
