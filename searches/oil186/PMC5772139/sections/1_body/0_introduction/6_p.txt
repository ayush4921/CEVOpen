0: One of the most important and cited references highlighting the advances in genetics, biotechnology, process chemistry, and engineering that has helped establish a new manufacturing concept to convert renewable biomass into valuable fuels and products, known as biorefinery, was published by Ragauskas and collaborators in the mid-2000s [ 16].
1: According to these authors and other researchers [ 16,  17], integrating biomass and biorefinery technologies has the potential to develop sustainable bio-based energy and materials leading to a new manufacturing paradigm (Fig.
2: 3).
