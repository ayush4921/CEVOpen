0: Chitosan powder (Sigma AldrichAmerica) with high molecular weight was dissolved in 1% acetic acid to give a 2% solution.
1: The resulting solution was stirred at room temperature for one night and was filtered using filter paper No.
2: 3 after addition of glycerol (0.5 ml per g of chitosan) as a plasticizer and tween 80 as an emulsifier for 30 min at room temperature, then the pH of the solution was adjusted to 8.5 using zinc.
3: After adding the desired concentrations of AEO (v/v% 2, 1.5, 1, 0.5, and 0) was homogenized using homogenizer at 12000 g for 2 min and films were molded in Tefloncoated dishes and dried for 36 hr at 25  2C.
4: Prepared films were stored for 48 hr before the test in a desiccator containing sodium bromide (25  2C and 50  2% RH).
