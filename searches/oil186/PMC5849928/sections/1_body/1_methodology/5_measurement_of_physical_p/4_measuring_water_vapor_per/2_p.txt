0: To carry out this experiment, ASTM No.
1: 96 E was used (ASTM,  1996).
2: Water was poured into the cell permeability measurement for testing.
3: Afterwards, the cell surface was coated with molten paraffin.
4: Cells were placed inside the desiccators containing silica gel.
5: Water at 25C produces 100% moisture.
6: The difference in humidity on the two sides of the coating at 25C makes the gradient of a steam pressure equal to 2.337*10 3 psi.
7: Changes in cell weight over time were measured using a digital scale with a precision of 0.0001 g. In all samples, by drawing the cell weight change curve relative to time, a straight line ( R2 > .99) was obtained.
8: The water vapor transmission rate was equivalent to the slope of the resulting lines divided by the cell surface and was obtained from the following equation: cell surface was 0.00287 m 2.
9: Cell surface/Line gradient=Water vapor transfer rate
