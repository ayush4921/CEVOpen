0: After weighing, the film pieces were put into 50 cc of distilled water and stirring was done for 6 hr at a temperature of 25C.
1: Then the film and water mixture was filtered in a filter paper that has already reached constant weight and was accurately weighed.
2: The filter paper was placed at 110C with the sample to reach constant weight.
3: The solubility of films in water is calculated as follows: (Hosseini et al.,  2009).
4: Solubility percentage=AB/C100
