0: Subsequent concentrations of the anise essential oil (100, 125, 150, 175, 200, etc.)
1: were prepared in MullerHinton medium containing 5% Dimethyl Sulfoxide.
2: In this method, plates of 96 houses were used with round holes and 300 l volume.
3: Then, 100 l of essential oil was transferred to each well and 20 l of bacterial suspension was added.
4: The contents of each well were mixed for 2 min by the Shakerequipped Plate Reader.
5: Then, light absorption was read using a plate reader at zero and at 630 nm length.
6: Plates were incubated at 35C for 24 hr and after completing the incubation, cloudiness or lack of cloudiness were observed in the wells and light absorption was read using Plate Reader at the wavelengths (Hosseinzadeh et al.,  2011).
