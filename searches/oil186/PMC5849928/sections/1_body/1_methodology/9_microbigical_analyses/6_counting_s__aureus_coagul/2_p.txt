0: Different dilutions prepared on a plate containing Baird Parker Agar Base were incubated at 37C for 48 hr and then plates containing 20300 colonies of  S. aureus were counted.
1: For significant colonies of this microorganism, coagulase test was performed and positive coagulase colonies were reported as  S. aureus.
2: The coagulase test was performed as follows: the suspicious colonies were transferred to tubes containing 0.3 ml of heart and brain juice and mixed well, and then cultured on a tryptic soy agar diagonal agar using a culture loop.
3: Both the liquid and solid cultures were incubated for 2418 hr at 37C.
4: Solid culture was used for storage for confirmatory tests, if necessary.
5: To a culture medium, about 0.5 ml of plasma was added and mixed, the tube containing the culture was reincubated at 37C and were examined for clot formation at intervals of up to 6 hr, and in case of clot formation, 4+ and 3 +  clots were reported as positive coagulase (Downes & Ito,  2000).
