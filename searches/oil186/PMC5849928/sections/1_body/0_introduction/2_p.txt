0: With the increase in population and the emergence of new phenomena such as the development of cities, the establishment of factories and, consequently, the employment of family members, to provide livelihood and relative welfare, the need for readymade foods has become a necessity and expanded to some extent that these foods are an integral part of people's lives today, while chicken products are of particular importance (Luiz, Moreira, Correa Ede, & Falcao,  2004).
1: One of the products of chicken meat is frozen raw chicken burger.
2: Meat keeping is limited due to its biological composition, even in glacial conditions, and it quickly receives microbial and chemical contamination, which can, in addition to health hazards, cause undesirable changes in its qualitative characteristics such as taste and smell, color, texture and a reduction in nutritional value and, finally, a loss of shelf life (Davidson & Zivanivic,  2003).
3: Oxidative spoilage causes unpleasant smell, undesirable flavor changes, eventually a change in the nutrient structure and a decrease in the nutritional value of the product, while microbial spoilage and contamination lead to serious risks to the health of the consumer.
4: Therefore, the use of appropriate substances with antibacterial and antioxidant activity is useful and necessary to improve the quality and increase the shelflife of the meat while preventing economic losses.
5: Antioxidants have been used for many years as additives in food.
6: In fact, antioxidants, by reducing the rate of fat oxidation, increase the shelflife of foodstuffs and improve the stability of lipids and lipid foods, thereby preventing the loss of sensory characteristics and their nutritional value (Burt,  2004).
7: Today, the use of natural antioxidants, such as spices and plants, as an alternative to synthetic antioxidants, is highly recommended for food preservation (Sakanaka, Tachibana, & Okada,  2005).
