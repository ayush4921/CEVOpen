0: Plates containing  A. flavus in PDA medium after 5 days of incubation at 28C were prepared for measuring aflatoxin B 1 test.
1: Culture medium content was completely transferred to 100 ml beaker and 8 ml of chloroformwater mixture with ratio of 115 were added to the beakers, and beakers content was mixed for 20 min.
2: Then the reaction mixture was filtered by filter paper and permeated into second series of beakers.
3: The remaining solids were returned to first series of the beakers, and all steps were repeated with 7 ml of solvent mixture.
4: Finally, the filter paper was washed with 11.5 ml of chloroform, and all permeate obtained were collected in the second series of the beakers.
5: Beakers were completely dried and washed with 3 ml of methanol and the collected solutions were poured in a special container with a lid that prevented the evaporation of methanol (Mayer, Farber, & Geisen,  2003).
