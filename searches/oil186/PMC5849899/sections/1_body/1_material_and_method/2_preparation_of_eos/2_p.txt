0: Using industrial boilers, EOs of thyme leaves was extracted by hydrodistillation method in which the EO extraction efficiency was equal to 1.1%.
1: The extraction efficiency for thyme has been previously reported as 1.66% (Moosavy et al.,  2008), which was generally influenced by many factors, such as the plant leaves to water ratio, time, and temperature of extraction process.
2: Initially, thyme was sun dried and the EO was extracted using hydrodistillation method in semiindustrial boilers (manufactured by KashanIran Taghtiran Co.).
3: For extraction of thyme EO, the proportion of water to dry leaves of  Zataria multiflora was 800/100 (l/kg).
4: Furthermore, the EO of clove was purchased from a Shargh Osareh Co. (Chenaran Industrial Estate, Mashhad, Iran).
5: Oil extraction efficiency (weight basis) was calculated from the following equation (Shukla, Kumar, Singh, & Dubey,  2009): EO extraction percentage(%)=ABA100where  A = weight of dry plant,  B = weight of essential oil obtained.
