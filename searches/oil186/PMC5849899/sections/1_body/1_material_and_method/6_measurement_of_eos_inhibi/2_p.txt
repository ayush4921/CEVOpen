0: PDB medium was prepared in accordance with Difco method (Difco Laboratories, 1984).
1: Erlenmeyer flasks containing a 3day culture of fungus were kept in incubator at 28C for 10 days, and their contents were evacuated in preweighed filter paper that had been put in a desiccator.
2: After complete drawl of fluid, filter paper containing fungal hyphae were transferred to 40C vacuum oven.
3: Then, the initial weight of filter paper was subtracted from filter paper containing fungus, and dry weight of fungus hyphae was found.
4: Comparison of the hyphae weight of the test sample with the weight of fungus in positive control sample indicated the effect of the tested EOs in inhibiting the fungal growth.
5: After separating the solid part, the permeate was excluded for measuring aflatoxin B 1 tests (Rasooli et al.,  2008).
