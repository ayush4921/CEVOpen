0: Plates containing any of thyme or clove EOs were prepared.
1: In order to culture  A. flavus, one of the fungus 3day cultures was divided into parts (2  2 mm), and each of these parts was placed at the center of the plates and incubated at 28C.
2: The positive control plate contained fungi with no EO, and negative control plate only contain EOs with no fungi.
3: The plates were checked every day, and the growth of fungus was enumerated as a function of hyphae growth radius.
4: Comparison of this radius in plates containing different concentrations of EO and positive control plate was introduced as inhibitory effect of EO on the fungi growth (Gandomi et al.,  2009).
5: Inhibition percentage(%)=R0R1R0100where  R0: radius of fungal hyphae growth in the positive control sample,  R1: radius of fungal hyphae growth in the test sample.
