0: Color deformation effects of  M.  officinalis oil cultivated in France, Ireland and Serbia and their major commercial components against  D.  farinae and  D.  pteronyssinus were investigated by the methods of Lee  et al.
1: 4.
2: Approximately two-fold concentrations of the contact + fumigant LD 90 values of each test sample were applied to 5.5 cm diameter filter paper.
3: After drying under a fume hood for 2 min, each filter paper was placed in the bottom section of a petri dish (5.5 cm i.d.
4: 1.5 cm deep), and then 80100 randomly selected adult mites (both sexes, 810 days old) of  D.  farinae and  D.  pteronyssinus were inoculated in each petri dish, and the lid was sealed as stated in above (contact + fumigant mortality bioassay section).
5: A color alteration of the mites was compared with color deformation before and after treatment and conducted using a light microscope (40 and 100) and naked eye.
