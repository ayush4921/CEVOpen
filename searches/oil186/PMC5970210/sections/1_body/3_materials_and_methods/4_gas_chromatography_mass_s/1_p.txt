0: The essential oils were analyzed on a GC-MS (HP 6890 and 5973 IV, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, USA).
1: The GC column was a DB-5 (0.25 mm film) fused silica capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm i.d.
2: 0.25 m thickness).
3: The GC oven temperature was programmed from 51 C to 211 C, then increased to 200 C at 2 C/min, and held at this temperature for 15 min.
4: Helium was used as the carrier gas at a rate of 0.81 mL/min for the analysis of the essential oils.
5: The essential oil was introduced directly into the MS. Mass spectra were obtained by automatic scanning in the mass range  m/z 50600 for 2 seconds.
6: Chromatographic peaks confirmed the retention index, retention time, and mass spectra, by comparison with the published mass spectra data 32.
