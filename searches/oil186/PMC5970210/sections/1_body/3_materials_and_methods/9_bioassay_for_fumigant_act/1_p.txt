0: Fumigant chambers covered with non-woven fabric of three thicknesses (10, 25, and 30 mm) were used to determine whether the  M.  officinalis oil (France) and 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal were effective in the control of  D.  farinae and  D.  pteronyssinus that live deep in pillows, carpet, and other fabric materials.
1: A fumigation chamber was constructed with two petri dish bottoms (5.5 cm i.d.
2: 1.5 cm deep each), stacked lip-to-lip to create a total volume of 71.24 cm 3 (Supplementary Fig.
3: S1).
4: The two plastic petri dish bottoms were separated by a 7  7 cm section of non-woven fabric of the three thicknesses.
5: Approximately two-fold concentrations of the contact + fumigant LD 90 values of each test samples were applied to 5.5 cm diameter filter.
6: After drying under a fume hood for 3 min, each treated filter paper was attached with double-sided adhesive tape (3 M, South Korea) to the lid of the upper chamber.
7: For each test, 30 adult mites (both sexes, 810 days old) were introduced into the untreated 5.5 cm diameter filter paper on the bottom of the lower chamber.
8: A wad of cotton saturated with distilled water (50 L) had been introduced to the bottom of the lower chamber.
9: The two plastic petri dish bottoms were held together, and wrapped in several layers of Parafilm , and the mites were held at 24 C and 74% relative humidity for 24 h. The mortality of each bioassay was determined by observing the number of mites under a binocular microscope (20, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
10: All experiments were replicated three times.
