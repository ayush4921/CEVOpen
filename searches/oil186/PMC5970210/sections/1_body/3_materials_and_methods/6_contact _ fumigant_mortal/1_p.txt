0: A contact + fumigant mortality bioassay was modified from the method described by Yun  et al.
1: 28 Various concentrations (104, 52, 26, 19.5, 13, 6.5, 3.25, 1.63 and 0.82 g/cm 2) of the three  M.  officinalis oils (France, Ireland, and Serbia) and all compounds were dissolved in ethanol (100 L), and applied to 5.5 cm diameter filter paper.
2: After drying under a fume hood for 2 min, each filter paper was placed in the bottom section of a petri dish (5.5 cm i.d.
3: 1.5 cm deep), and then 30 randomly selected adult mites (both sexes, 810 days old) of  D.  farinae and  D.  pteronyssinus were inoculated in each petri dish, and the lid was sealed.
4: Positive control with the  N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide, a commonly used acaricide for mite control, was similarly formulated.
5: Negative controls received ethanol (100 L) only.
