0: The closed and open container method, described by Kwon and Ahn 29, was used to determine whether the lethality of  M.  officinalis oil (France) and 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal against adults of  D.  farinae and  D.  pteronyssinus was attributable to contact or fumigant (vapor) action.
1: A group of 30 randomly selected adult mites (both sexes, 810 days old) were introduced into untreated 5.5 cm diameter filter paper on the bottom of a petri dish (5.5 cm i.d.
2: 1.5 cm deep), and each petri dish was covered with a fine cotton mesh.
3: Approximately two-fold concentrations of the contact + fumigant LD 90 values of each test material were applied to 5.5 cm diameter filter papers, as stated in contact + fumigant mortality bioassay.
4: Each treated filter paper was separately placed on top of the cotton mesh (6.5 cm diameter), to prevent direct contact of mites with the test sample.
5: Each petri dish was sealed either with another tight-fitting lid (closed container method), or with another tight-fitting lid with a 3 cm central hole (open container method), to determine the potential vapor phase toxicity of the test samples.
6: Negative controls received ethanol (100 L) only.
