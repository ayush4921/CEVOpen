0: Direct and indirect spray application methods described by Kim  et al.
1: 33 and Yun  et al.
2: 28 were used to investigate the efficacy of the three spray formulations against adult  D.  farinae and  D.  pteronyssinus.
3: For the direct spray application method, groups of 40 adult mites (both sexes, 810 days old) were placed on 5.5 cm diameter filter paper 5 min prior to spraying.
4: Each test sample was then sprayed two times successively at 15 cm upwards onto the 5.5 cm diameter filter paper.
5: For the indirect spray application method, each test sample was sprayed two times successively at 15 cm upwards onto the filter paper (5.5 diameter).
6: Groups of 30 randomly selected adult mites (both sexes, 810 days old) were introduced into treated 5.5 cm diameter filter paper on the bottom of a petri dish (5.5 cm i.d.
7: 1.5 cm deep), and each petri dish was sealed with lid.
8: For comparison, DEET and permethrin ( cis:trans 25:75) 2.5 g /L were served as the positive controls.
9: Because permethrin ( cis:trans 25:75) 2.5 g /L spray has been approved by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS, South Korea), the commercial acaricide served as positive controls for spray bioassays.
10: Ethoxylated castor oil (surfactant) + ethanol + distilled water was served as the negative control.
11: The treated and control mites were maintained for 24 h at 24 C and 74% relative humidity in darkness.
12: The mortality of each bioassay was determined by observing the number of mites under a binocular microscope (40 and 100, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
13: All experiments were replicated three times.
