0: To the best of our knowledge, no reports are available on acaricidal toxicities and the color deformation effects of  M.  officinalis oils cultivated in France, Ireland, and Serbia against  D.  farinae and  D.  pteronyssinus.
1: Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the chemical composition of the essential oils of  M.  officinalis cultivated in France, Ireland, and Serbia, and to evaluate their acaricidal and color deformation properties against  D.  farinae and  D.  pteronyssinus.
2: We further tested spray formulations containing 0.25, 0.5, and 1%  M.  officinalis oil cultivated in France and its main compound, to investigate the most effective formulations for use as a future acaricide and mite indicator.
