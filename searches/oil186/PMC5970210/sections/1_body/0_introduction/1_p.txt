0: House dust mites (HDMs), such as  Dermatophagoides farinae and  D.  pteronyssinus, are an important source of atopic dermatitis, perennial rhinitis, and asthma, with more than a million people at risk in the world 1.
1: HDMs, mainly inhabit the house, apartment, and workplace 1,  2.
2: Changes in housing lifestyle, such as individual households in flats, together with carpets and central installed heating, have increased the conditions for the multiplication of  D.  farinae and  D.  pteronyssinus3.
3: In addition, HDM allergy is also caused by mite faecal pellets, eggs, and dead mite bodies, making it difficult to control mites from the indoor environment 4.
4: Control of  D.  farinae and  D.  pteronyssinus has been conducted by chemical or physical methods 5.
5: Synthetic acaricides are most commonly used, and include chemical agents containing benzyl benzoate, dibutyl phthalate  N, N-diethyl- m-toluamide (DEET) and pyrethroids 6.
6: Although these acaricides are effective, misuse of synthetic acaricides has led to serious drawbacks, including acaricidal resistance, toxicity of human and animals, and environmental hazards 7.
7: In recent years, the development of natural insecticides derived from plants and microbes is required to overcome these drawbacks.
8: Plant-derived products (e.g.
9: 2-isopropyl-5-methylphenol and geraniol) that have wide bioactivity against hygienic insect pests and harmful insects have been researched as alternatives to existing insecticides 8,  9.
