0: The essential oil from  F. vulgare oil was analyzed by GLC-MS using an instrument (GCMS-QP2010 Ultra, Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) operated in the EI mode (electron energy = 70 eV), scan range = 3.0 scans s 1.
1: The GC column was ZB-5 fused silica capillary with a (5% phenyl)-polymethyl siloxane stationary phase a film thickness of 0.25 mm.
2: The carrier gas was helium with a column head pressure 551 kPa and flow rate of 1.37 mL min 1.
3: Injector temperature was 250 C and the ion source temperature was 200 C, increased in temperature rate 2 C min 1 to 260 C. The GC oven temperature program was programmed from 50 C initial temperature, increased at a rate of 2 C min 1 to 260 C. A 5%  w/ v solution of the sample in CH 2Cl 2 was prepared and 0.1 L was injected in splitting mode (30:1).
