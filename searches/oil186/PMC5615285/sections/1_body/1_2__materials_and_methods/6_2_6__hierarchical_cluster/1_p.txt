0: A total of 68 chemical compositions of  F. vulgare essential oils, including the sample from this study in addition to 66 compositions obtained from the published literature [ 5, 6, 7, 9, 23, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45] were used to carry out the cluster analysis using the XLSTAT software, version 2015.4.01.
1: The essential oil compositions were treated as operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and the percentages of 34 of the most abundant essential oil components ( trans-anethole, limonene, estragole, fenchone, -pinene, -phellandrene,  p-anisaldehyde, -phellandrene, -pinene,  exo-fenchyl acetate,  p-cymene, myrcene, ( E)--ocimene, camphor, 10-nonacosanone, piperitenone oxide, sabinene, neophytadiene,  cis-anethole,  trans-dihydrocarvone, -terpinene, carvone, phytol, 1,8-cineole,  iso-isopulegol,  trans--terpineol,  endo-fenchyl acetate, camphene, carvacrol, apiole,  o-cymene, -3-carene, linalool, and thymol) were used to establish the chemical relationships of the  F. vulgare essential oil samples using the agglomerative hierarchical cluster (AHC) method.
2: Pearson correlation was selected as a measure of similarity, and the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic average (UPGMA) was used for definition of the clusters.
