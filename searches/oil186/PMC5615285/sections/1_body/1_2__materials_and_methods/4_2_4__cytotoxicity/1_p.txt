0: The potential cytotoxicity of the fennel essential oil against of the five human tumor cell lines (HeLa, Caco-2, MCF-7, CCRF-CEM and CEM/ADR5000) were determined by the MTT assay.
1: The cells were seeded at a density of 2  10 4 cells/well (HeLa, Caco-2, MCF-7) and 3  10 4 cells/well (CCRF-CEM and CEM/ADR5000).
2: The essential oil was serially diluted in media in the presence of DMSO at concentrations between 10 mg/L and 5 g/L; 100 L of each concentration was applied to the wells of a 96-well plates.
3: Cells were incubated with the essential oil for 24 h (HeLa, Caco-2, MCF-7) and 48 h (CCRF-CEM and CEM/ADR5000) before the medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium containing 0.5 mg/mL 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT).
4: The formazan crystals produced were dissolved in DMSO 4 h later; the absorbance was measured at 570 nm with a Biochrom Asys UVM 340 Microplate Reader (Cambridge, UK).
