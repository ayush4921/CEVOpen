0: The DS database comparison process was comprised of four phases: Phase1 - the selection of DS databases to be incorporated into our study; Phase2 - a top-down, systematic review of these databases to understand essential data elements required for DS representation; Phase3 - the generation of a preliminary model that could be employed to represent each DS concept in a consistent, precise, and holistic fashion; Phase4 - a comparison of data elements coverage across the selected databases.
1: Figure 1 illustrates the phases and corresponding criteria.
