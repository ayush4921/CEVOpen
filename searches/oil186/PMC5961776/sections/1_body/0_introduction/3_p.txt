0: Integrating information across diverse resources (e.g., online databases, biomedical literature) and further developing a data model to comprehensively represent DS and relevant safety information could potentially fill the knowledge gap to improve DS product safety.
1: Common online sources for DS information include commercial databases such as Natural Medicines (NM), a primarily ingredient level resource, and publically available databases, such as U.S. Dietary Supplement Label Database (DSLD) and Canadian Natural Health Product Ingredient database (NHPID), which are both considered as product level resources.
2: Product labeling statements in these resources contain very limited safety information.
3: There remains a critical need to more fully represent supplements by linking these databases using a common data model.
4: Accurate and comprehensive supplement representation is also vital for accurate information extraction from both the biomedical literature and online databases.
