0: Most people consider DS as safe and usually take them without consulting with healthcare providers.
1: However, there is increasing evidence that DS could interact with prescription medicine and also cause serious adverse events.
2: According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an average of 23,000 annual emergency visits were related to DS in US  5.
3: Unlike prescription and over-the-counter medicines, DS are regulated by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA)  6 and unlike drugs, clinical trials on DS safety and efficacy before getting marketed are not required.
4: In addition, it is voluntary for healthcare providers to report only serious adverse events, including hospitalization, disability, and death, related to DS in the post-market surveillance.
5: Current safety documentation for DS is very limited as most available information is based either on pharmacologic research, animal models or pharmaco-epidemiologic studies that often solely focus on a small set of drugs or supplements.
6: These have greatly limited our ability to build up our knowledge on safety of DS.
