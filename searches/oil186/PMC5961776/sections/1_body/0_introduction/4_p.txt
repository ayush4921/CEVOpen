0: Our prior work demonstrated number of gaps with regards to term representation in existing standard terminologies (Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), RxNorm and National Drug File-Reference Terminology (NDF-RT)) and clinical notes within Electronic Health Records  7,   8.
1: Currently, no prior work has been done to comprehensively represent DS and the associated data model.
2: In this study, we selected five online databases for DS, both at the ingredient and product level, and compared them against the list of data elements considered essential to comprehensively represent DS.
3: This is the initial step towards the development of formal DS terminology/ontology model that could represent DS related information in a more accurate and consistent format, similar to drugs.
4: The knowledge gained here will promote informatics research in DS, such as information extraction and knowledge discovery of safety on DS.
