0: The objective of this study is to evaluate and compare existing online resources for DS representation.
1: Common sources for DS information include databases such as, Dietary Supplement Ingredient Database (DSID)  10, Natural Medicine (NM)  11, Natural Health Products Ingredients Database (NHPID)  12, Dietary Supplement Label Database (DSLD)  13, and Licensed Natural Health Products Database (LNHPD)  14.
2: Some drug databases also incorporate DS coverage to variable extent, e.g., DailyMed  15, drugs.com  16, etc., which are not included in this study.
3: This goal is achieved through systematic review of selected resources at both the ingredient and product levels, compilation of the essential elements for DS representation as a preliminary model, and a comparison of the existing databases using this model as a check-list.
4: To achieve this goal, we examined element of three ingredient level databases (DSID, NM, & NHPID) and two product level resources (DSLD & LNHPD), to assess areas of uniqueness, overlaps and gaps where further information may be beneficial.
