0: A broth microdilution method was used to determine the MIC and MBC.
1: The potato dextrose broth and Mueller Hinton broth were prepared at twice the final concentration.
2: M. alternifolia essential oil was added to glass tubes to yield final sample media concentrations at 0.2 to 48 mg/mL for the potato dextrose and Mueller Hinton broths, respectively.
3: The control sets were run simultaneously without the addition of an antimicrobial agent.
4: An appropriate volume of inoculum (6.0 logCFU/mL) was added to the media to give an approximate final cell concentration of 4.0 logCFU/mL.
5: P. italicum Wehmer and  P. digitatum Sacc.
6: cultures in potato dextrose broth were incubated at 28C and 120 rpm for 48 h, whereas  E. coli and  S. aureus cultures in Mueller Hinton broth were incubated at 37C and 120 rpm for 24 h. The essential oil concentration that yielded no visible growth for a tested species was considered the MIC for that particular species.
7: Then, 0.1 mL suspension obtained from the above transparent tubes was spread onto either potato dextrose agar (PDA) or Mueller Hinton agar (MHA).
8: After 48 h culturing at 28C (fungi) or 48 h culturing at 37C (bacteria), the concentration of inoculated suspension containing the lowest level of antimicrobial agent that showed no colonies on the plate was determined as the MBC.
