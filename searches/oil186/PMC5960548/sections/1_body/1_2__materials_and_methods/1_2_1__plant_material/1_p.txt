0: Melaleuca alternifolia (M. alternifolia) samples were collected in four locations of Zhaoqing City of Guangdong Province at altitudes between 300 and 600 m. Samples were dried in well-ventilated spaces away from sunlight.
1: Samples were then placed at 50C to dry the samples to a constant, dry weight and disintegrated through a 90-mesh sieve.
2: Air-dried plant materials were hydrodistilled using a Clevenger-type apparatus.
3: The composition of  M. alternifolia essential oil was analyzed in the laboratory using Hewlett-Packard 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a cross-linked 5% PH ME siloxane Hewlett-Packard-5MS capillary column (25 m  0.25 mm ID, 0.25  m film thickness), coupled to a Hewlett-Packard 5972A mass spectrometer (Hewlett-Packard Ltd., Bracknell, UK).
4: The GC operating conditions were as follows: helium as carrier gas with a flow rate 2.0 ml/min; column temperature programming from 60C to 275C at 4C/min; injector and FID detector temperatures of 215 and 275C, respectively.
5: The MS operating parameters were as follows: ionization potential, 70 ev; resolution, 1000; ion source temperature, 250C.
6: Identification of components was based on GC retention indices and the fragmentation patterns of the mass spectra with those of authentic samples, as well as the NIST 98 and HPCH 2205 GCMS libraries.
7: Relative percentage amounts were obtained directly from GC peak areas.
8: The composition of the essential oil from  M. alternifolia is presented in  Table 1.
