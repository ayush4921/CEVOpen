0: This spectrophotometric assay uses the stable 2,2-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical as a reagent [ 14].
1: One milliliter of various concentrations of the samples in methanol was added to 3 mL of 100  M DPPH dissolved in methanol.
2: After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the absorbance was measured against a blank at 517 nm.
3: The antioxidant activity was determined using the following equation: (%, elimination of DPPH) = ( Ablank   Asample/ Ablank)  100.
4: The extract concentration providing 50% elimination (EC50) was calculated from the graph plotting inhibition percentage against extract concentration.
5: Tests were carried out in triplicate.
