0: The thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) method was used as described by [ 15].
1: One milliliter of various concentrations of the samples in methanol was added to 3 mL of 10% yolk homogenate and incubated for 30 min at room temperature.
2: Then, 0.1 mL of a ferrous sulfate solution was added and the reaction incubated for 30 min at 37C.
3: Next, 3.0 mL of 10% trichloroacetic acid was added and the reaction centrifuged at 2000 g for 5 min.
4: Subsequently, 1.0 mL of the supernatant was mixed with 3.0 mL of a 0.67% TBA solution in 50% glacial acetic acid.
5: The mixture was heated in a boiling water bath for ~30 min.
6: The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 2000 g for 5 min if the solution became turbid.
7: Finally, the absorbance was measured at 535 nm.
8: A decrease in absorbance indicates an increase in antioxidant activity.
9: The antioxidant activity was determined using the following equation: (%, inhibition of peroxidation) = ( Ablank   Asample/ Ablank)  100.
10: The extract concentration providing 50% inhibition (IC50) was calculated from the graph plotting inhibition percentage against extract concentration.
11: Tests were carried out in triplicate.
