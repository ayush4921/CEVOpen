0: The hydroxyl radical scavenging activity was measured by the method described in [ 16].
1: The reaction mixture (1.0 mL) consisting of 0.1 mL of 2-deoxy-D-ribose (28 mM in 20 mM KH 2PO 4-KOH buffer, pH 7.4), 0.1 mL of various concentrations of the samples, 0.2 mL EDTA (1.04 mM) and 200  M FeCl 3 (1 : 1 v/v), 0.1 mL of H 2O 2 (1.0 mM), and 0.1 mL ascorbic acid (1.0 mM) was incubated at 37C for 1 h. One milliliter of thiobarbituric acid (1%) and 1.0 mL of trichloroacetic acid (2.8%) were added and the solution incubated at 100C for 20 min.
2: After cooling, the absorbance was measured at 532 nm.
3: The antioxidant activity was determined using the following equation: (%, elimination of hydroxyl radical) = ( Ablank   Asample/ Ablank)  100.
4: The extract concentration providing 50% elimination (EC50) was calculated from the graph plotting inhibition percentage against extract concentration.
5: Tests were carried out in triplicate.
