0: All the physical parameters measurements were performed on 5 samples/group and 6 samples/group in Exp.
1: 1 and Exp.
2: 2, respectively.
3: Marbling were scored using the National Pork Producer Council standards (marbling from 1 = devoid to 10 = abundant) [ 28].
4: Measurements of pH at 45 min and 24 h postmortem were performed on LT muscles using a pH meter (pH-STAR, SFK-Technology, Denmark).
5: Meat color (MC) at 45 min and 24 h in Exp.
6: 1 were measured for 3 times per sample on the cut surface using the OPTO-STAR meat color determinator (Matthaus).
7: Color measurements (L*, a*, b*) in Exp.
8: 2 were performed at 45 min postmortem from a mean of four random readings made with a chromameter (CR-300, Minolta Camera, Osaka, Japan), previously calibrated against a white tile according to the manufacturers manual.
9: Drip loss and Cooking loss were determined by the method described by Honikel [ 29].
10: For drip loss determination, fresh meat samples (approximate 40 g) were held in a plastic box on a grid parallel to the fibre direction.
11: The weight loss percentages after 1 (Exp.
12: 1), 2, 4, and 8 days of storage at 4 C were calculated.
13: For cooking loss determination, a fresh slice from each sample was weighed (approximate 145 g), placed in a plastic bag, and cooked to an internal temperature of 70 C in a 75 C water bath.
14: The internal temperature was monitored during cooking with a handheld temperature probe.
15: The cooked samples were cooled for 30 min, blotted dry, and weighed.
16: Cooking loss was expressed as the weight change percentage at the end of cooking.
17: Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF) was determined in samples cooled at 4 C for 24 h. Six cylindrical cores (10 mm  10 mm) were removed from each sample parallel to the fiber direction, then, were sheared with a WBSF device attached to an Instron Universal Testing Machine (model 1011, Instron instrument, USA) with a 50-kg tension using a crosshead speed of 100 mm/min.
18: The peak force (Newton/cm 2) was recorded.
