0: Lipids from LT muscle samples were extracted in chloroform-methanol according to Folch et al.
1: [ 31].
2: Fatty acid methyl esters were separated and determined with a CP-3800 Gas Chromatograph [ 32].
3: The fatty acids were identified by comparing the retention times of the peaks with those of known standards (Sigam Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA).
4: The response factors for the fatty acids were calculated using the same standard mixtures plus an internal standard [ 32].
5: Peaks were identified using standards where available (Sigma Chemical Co. Ltd., Poole).
