1: The data were analyzed using the Statistical Analysis System (version 8.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
2: Data for physical and chemical parameters, antioxidant enzyme activities, and fatty acid profile of IMF were analyzed by one-way ANOVA where the diet was the main effect.

4: 2 were assessed by a two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with dietary treatment, time, and their interaction as effects.

7: When a significant  p-value ( P < 0.05 or  P < 0.10) was observed in ANOVA, means of dietary treatments were compared using Duncans multiple comparison, whereas  P < 0.10 was considered a tendency.
