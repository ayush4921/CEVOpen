0: In total, 21 healthy crossbred barrows (Landrace  Large White, 50 days old) with initial BW of 16.31  1.26 kg were used in a 95-d trial.
1: Pigs were placed in metabolism cages that were equipped with a feeder and a nipple drinker, fully slatted floors, and a screen floor.
2: The pigs were randomly allotted to one of three diets based on BW in a randomized complete block design with seven replicate pigs per diet.
3: The diets based on corn, distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS), and soybean meal.
4: Each diet supplemented with 150 mg aureomycin per kg feed as antibiotic growth promoter.
5: A normal protein diet (NPD) with 170 and 156 g CP/kg with one percentage unit below the nutrient requirements of the National Research Council [ 26] for the growing and finishing period, respectively.
6: A medium CP level diet (MPD) with 10 g CP/kg less than the NPD for the growing and finishing period, and a low level diet (LPD) with 20 g CP/kg less than the NPD for the two phases.
7: All diets were fortified with Lys, Met, Thr and Trp to meet the requirements of growing-finishing pigs [ 27].
8: Nutrient contents of the experimental diets were presented in Table  1.
9: All pigs were allowed ad libitum access to feed and water throughout the experiment.
