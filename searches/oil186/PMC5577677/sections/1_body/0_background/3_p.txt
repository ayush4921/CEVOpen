0: Synthetic and natural antioxidants have been used to delay the lipid oxidation in pork [ 12].
1: Herbal feed additives and organic acid have been suggested as desirable alternatives to benefit growth performance of the pigs by improving the gut health.
2: Oregano essential oil (OEO) contains the natural and volatile aromatic compounds that exert different biological actions, such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative activities [ 13].
3: Carvacrol and thymol, the two main phenolic derivatives that constitute about 81.9 and 3.5% of OEO, are principally responsible for the activities [ 13,  14].
4: In addition, other minor constituents such as -terpinene and -cymene, two monoterpene hydrocarbons that constitute about 4.49 and 3.07% of OEO, respectively, also contribute to the activities [ 15,  16].
5: In our previous studies, we found that OEO can improve growth performance [ 17], intestinal barrier integrity [ 18], and antioxidant enzyme activities in the intestinal tissues [ 19].
