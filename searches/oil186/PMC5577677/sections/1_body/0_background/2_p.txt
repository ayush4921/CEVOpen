0: Dietary methods to manipulate the fat quantity and composition of pork have been previously reported, including low-protein or lysine-deficient diets [ 3,  6,  7].
1: A reduced protein diet promoted pork with higher IMF percentage which was more monounsaturated and less polyunsaturated even when balanced with essential amino acids [ 2,  8].
2: The tissue-specific increase of expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase could be one reason for higher de novo synthesis of fatty acids in muscle of pigs fed reduced protein diets [ 9].
3: However, unsaturated fatty acids are more sensitive to oxidation than saturated fatty acids (SFA) and particularly vulnerable to peroxidative attack [ 10].
4: Moreover, the lipid oxidation in muscle is a major deterioration of nutritional and sensory properties of meat and meat products [ 11].
