0: During the last few decades, the pork market has been subjected to several changes influenced by consumer demands, which have focused the production toward healthier, safer, and tastier meat.
1: The intramuscular fat (IMF) is crucial for meat palatability, such as tenderness and juiciness, and is an important economic trait in pork production [ 1 3].
2: Besides the IMF amounts, consumers are becoming increasingly interested in food containing high concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA).
3: PUFA are considered as functional ingredients to prevent cardiovascular disease [ 4,  5].
4: Hence, meat producers require producing and supplying meat that contains appropriately higher IMF and PUFA.
