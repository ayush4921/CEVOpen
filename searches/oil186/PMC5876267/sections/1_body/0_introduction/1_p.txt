0: Anisakiasis is a fish-borne parasitic disease; it is caused by the consumption of raw or undercooked fish, as well as cephalopods, contaminated by third instar larvae of species belonging to the genus  Anisakis (Anisakidae), with special reference to  Anisakis simplex,  Anisakis pegreffii and  Pseudoterranova decipiens (Grabda  1976; Mattiucci and Nascetti  2006; Audicana and Kennedy  2008; Pravettoni et al.
1: 2012) .
2: After ingestion, the larvae penetrate the gastric and intestinal mucosa, causing the symptoms of anisakiasis (Broglia and Kapel  2011).
3: Recently, it has been estimated that about 20,000 cases of anisakiasis are reported per year worldwide.
4: The large majority of the cases is from Japan (> 90%), due to the traditional use of  sashimi as food.
5: Other countries characterized by a rather large number of anisakiasis cases are Spain, the Netherlands, Germany and Scandinavia (Bao et al.
6: 2017).
