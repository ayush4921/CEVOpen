0: Nowadays, the endoscopic removal of live larvae still represents the main effective treatment against anisakiasis (Sugita et al.
1: 2008; Pravettoni et al.
2: 2012).
3: Furthermore, protection against anisakiasis can be enhanced educating consumers about the risks linked with eating raw or undercooked seafood.
4: From a pharmacological point of view, antibiotics, anticholinergics and/or corticosteroids have been employed for the treatment of anisakiasis, showing patchy and limited efficacy (Matsui et al.
5: 1985).
6: However, a relevant exception is represented by albendazole (Dziekonska-Rynko et al.
7: 2002; Romero et al.
8: 2014), since it has been recently showed that this compound dose-dependently reduced (500 g/ml led to 100% 48 h post-treatment) the survival of  A. simplex third instar larvae (Arias-Diaz et al.
9: 2006).
10: However, it has been noted that acidic medium pH reduced its efficacy (Arias-Diaz et al.
11: 2006).
12: In this scenario, there is an urgent need to develop novel and effective tools and drugs for the treatment of  A. simplex parasitic infections (Molina-Garcia and Sanz  2002; Brutti et al.
13: 2010), including the use of natural products (Hierro et al.
14: 2004,  2006; Lin et al.
15: 2010; Gomez-Rincon et al.
16: 2014; Valero et al.
17: 2015).
