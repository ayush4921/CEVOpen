0: Live larvae of  A. simplex can cause a parasitic infection of the digestive tract.
1: In addition, they can also affect other organs causing erosive and/or haemorrhagic lesions, ascites and perforations until granulomas and masses, if the larvae are not promptly removed.
2: Furthermore, the presence of larvae of  A. simplex can lead to allergic reactions, as anaphylaxis, acute/chronic urticaria and angioedema (Asturias et al.
3: 2000; Nieuwenhuizen et al.
4: 2003; Berger and Marr  2006; Choi et al.
5: 2009; Pravettoni et al.
6: 2012).
7: Notably, the larvae of  A. simplex can induce an immune adaptive response characterized by T-lymphocyte proliferation with polyclonal and monoclonal (which are responsible for allergic symptoms), IgE production, eosinophilia and mastocytosis (Park et al.
8: 2009; Pravettoni et al.
9: 2012).
