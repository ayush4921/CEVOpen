0: Agar block plates were prepared in 12-well plates to study the capacity of the living larvae to penetrate.
1: The agar solution was made with the following reagents: 0.75% agar in RPMI 1640 medium solution (pH 4, Sigma, USA) with 20% FBS (Lonza, USA).
2: One millilitre of the solution was poured into each well.
3: Then, 100 l of supernatant, RPMI-1640 (RPMI-1640, 20% FBS, 1% commercial pepsin, pH 4.0), was placed into each well.
4: A. simplex L3 larvae were incubated with a sub-lethal concentration (0.125 mg/ml) of  O. compactum essential oil for 24 h. Five larvae were placed on each control or simple well.
5: The plates were incubated for 24 h, and the number of L3 larvae that penetrated the solid agar block was counted after that period.
