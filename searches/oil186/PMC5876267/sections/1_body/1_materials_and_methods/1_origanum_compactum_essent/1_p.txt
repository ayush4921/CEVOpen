1: Its analysis was achieved on an Agilent 6890 N gas chromatograph equipped with a 5973-N mass spectrometer (MS).
2: The settings for the MS were as follows: EI mode, 70 eV, and mass to charge ratio ( m/z) scan between 35 and 400.
3: A HP-5 MS capillary column (30 m  ID 0.25 mm  0.25 m film thickness, J & W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA) using helium gas flow (1.0 ml/min) was used for separation.
4: The GC temperature program was as follows: initial 50 C for 5 min, then increasing with 20 C/min to 300 C. The injector temperature was 150 C. Quali-quantitative analysis of the essential oil was performed according to the work of Benelli et al.
