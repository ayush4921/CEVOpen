0: This assay was performed in 6 well plates.
1: Ten larvae were introduced in each well of polystyrene plates with a final volume of 2 ml sterile saline solution containing different concentrations of the test solution (Gomez-Rincon et al.
2: 2014).
3: O. compactum essential oil was tested against  Anisakis in the range of 01 l/ml.
4: The major constituents carvacrol and thymol were tested in the same range of concentrations.
5: Appropriate control wells without treatments were also carried out in each experiment.
6: The parasites were incubated at 37 C for 24 and 48 h. Levamisole was used as the reference antiparasitic drug.
7: Larvae were examined at 24 and 48 h under microscope, and immobile L3 was considered dead.
