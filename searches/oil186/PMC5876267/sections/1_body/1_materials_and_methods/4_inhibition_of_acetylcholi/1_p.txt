0: The inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was determined in 96 microplates using the method by Ellman et al.
1: ( 1961) with some modifications.
2: Each well contained 25 l of 15 mM ATCI in Millipore water, 125 l of 3 mM DTNB in buffer C (50 mM TrisHCl, pH 8, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.02 M MgCl2 6 H2O), 50 l buffer B (50 mM TrisHCl, pH 8, 0.1% bovine serum), and 25 l of test compound or extract.
3: Every concentration was tested in triplicates.
4: Then, 25 l and 0.22 U/ml AChE were added and the absorbance was measured eight times every 13 s at 405 nm.
5: Galantamine was used as reference.
