0: The amount of total phenolic content was measured in ethanolic extracts by colorimetric method using Folin-Ciocalteu.
1: Standard solutions with concentration of 12.5, 25, 50, 62.5,100, and 125 ppm were prepared from gallic acid in 60% solution.
2: A total of 0.1 mL of each solution was transferred to a test tube and 0.5 mL of reagent Folin-Ciocalteu solution 10% was added and after 3 to 8 minutes, 0.4 mL 7.5% sodium carbonate solution was added to it, then the tubes were kept at laboratory temperature for 30 minutes.
3: The optical absorption was measured at a wavelength of 765 nm by a spectrophotometer (Unico UV-2100, Dayton, NJ, USA) and a standard curve was prepared.
4: Then 0.01 to 0.02 g of the dried extract was dissolved in 60% methanol up to the volume of 10 mL.
5: Total phenol content was determined based on Folin-Ciocalteu method with the difference that instead of the standard solution, 0.1 mL of the extract solution was added.
6: The obtained absorbance rate was posed at the standard curve and thus the total phenol content of the extract in mg/g gallic acid equivalent was estimated.
