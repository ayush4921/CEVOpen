0: The gas chromatographic analyses of essential oils were carried out by an Agilent 6890 GC system with a HP-5MS (60 m  0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 m).
1: The carrier gas (helium) was used at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min.
2: The gas chromatograph oven temperature was kept at 40C for 1 minute and programmed to 230C at the rate of 3C/min.
3: The injector and detector temperatures were 230C and 250C, respectively.
4: Quantitative data were obtained electronically from flam ionization detector area percent data.
5: The main chemical constituents of essential oils were compared with analytical standard and tested in triplicate.
