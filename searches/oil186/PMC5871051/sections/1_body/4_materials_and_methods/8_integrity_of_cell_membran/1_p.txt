0: The cell integrity of  Listeria strains is tested by determining the release of cell components into supernatant according to the method described by Xu et al 26 with some modifications.
1: Bacteria from the working culture of  Listeria strains were collected by centrifuged for 15 minutes at 5000 rpm, washed 3 times, and resuspended in 0.1 M phosphate buffered solution.
2: Then, cell suspension obtained were incubated at 37C under agitation for 4 hours in the presence of essential oils and extracts at MIC concentration.
3: After that, 10 mL of samples were collected and centrifuged at 11 000 rpm for 3 minutes.
4: The concentration of the released components including especially of nucleic acids, 1 mL supernatant was used to measure ultraviolet absorption at 260 nm.
