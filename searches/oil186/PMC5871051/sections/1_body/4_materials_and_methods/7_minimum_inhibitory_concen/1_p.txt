0: The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC).
1: The 96-well plastic microdilution tray were prepared by dispensing into each well 95 L of Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB; Merck Co, Darmstadt, Germany) and 5 L of each isolate suspension equivalent to 0.5 McFarland.
2: Finally, 100 L of consecutive dilution of (serial 2-fold dilutions) each extract or essential oil were added to each well.
3: Positive and negative controls were considered as follows: positive control195 L MHB containing DMSO and 5 L of bacterial suspension without extracts and essential oils and negative control200 L of MHB containing DMSO without bacterial inoculum.
4: After mixing the samples by shaker (with the rate of 300 rpm per 20 S), they were placed in an incubator for 18 to 24 hours at 37C.
5: The wells were examined according to the presence or lack of turbidity.
6: Dilution plate of the well containing the lowest concentration of plant extracts or essential oils that inhibited growth of bacteria (lack of turbidity) was determined as the MIC.
7: Furthermore, the lowest concentration that showed no visible growth on Mueller-Hinton agar was determined as the MBC.
