0: The determination of the total antioxidant activity of plant extracts and essential oils was done by iron reduction (ferric reducing antioxidant power assay).
1: 24 The stock solutions included 300 M acetate buffer pH 3.6 (3.1 g C 2H 3NaO 2c3H 2O and 16 mL C 2H 4O 2), 10 M 2,4,6- tripyridyl-s-triazine (TPTZ) solution in 40 M HCl, and 20 M FeCl 3c6H 2O solution.
2: FRAP reagent was prepared by mixing 25 mL acetate buffer, 2.5 mL TPTZ, and 2.5 mL FeCl 3c6H 2O solution.
3: The temperature of the solution was raised to 37C before use.
4: A volume of 200 L of the plant extracts (1 mg/mL) and essential oils was mixed with 2800 L of the ferric reducing antioxidant power reagent.
5: The absorbance was measured after 30-minute incubation at 37C in dark condition at 593 nm.
6: The values were calculated from a calibration curve obtained with FeSO 4c7H 2O (100-1000 M).
7: Final results were expressed as M Fe 2+/g extract or essential oil.
