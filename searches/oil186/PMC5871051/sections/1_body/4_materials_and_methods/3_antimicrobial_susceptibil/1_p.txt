0: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the  Listeria isolates was performed by the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method using Mueller-Hinton agar (Merck Co, Darmstadt, Germany) according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute.
1: 22 A bacterial suspension with equivalent turbidity to 0.5 McFarland standard (1.5  10 8 cfu/mL) was prepared in sterile phosphate buffered saline (137 mM NaCl, 10 mM phosphate, 2.7 mM KCl, pH 7.4).
2: The sterile swab stick was dipped into bacterial suspension and then on the surface of agar was uniformly inoculated.
3: Five antibiotic disks were placed for each plate and incubated at 35C for 24 hours.
4: Inhibition zones on agar plate were measured after 24 hours and the results were recorded in accordance with interpretive criteria provided by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute.
5: The antibiotics discs (HiMedia Laboratories Pvt Ltd, Mumbai, India) are reported as follows: ampicillin (10 g), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, clindamycin (2 g), erythromycin (15 g), gentamycin (10 g), ciprofloxacin (5 g), penicillin (10 g), tetracycline (30 g), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (10 g), vancomycin (30 g), nitrofurantoin (300 g), norfloxacin (30 g), kanamycin (30 g), ceftriaxone (30 g), and chloramphenicol (30 g).
