0: Therefore, there is an urgent need for control the spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens to new antimicrobial agents as a strategy.
1: Presently, extracts and essential oils of medicinal plants are used as a novel source of effective antimicrobial agents.
2: 17 Previous works have demonstrated the antimicrobial properties of many plant essential oils and extracts as natural substances.
3: 1,  2,  17,  18 The presence of bioactive compounds such as phenolic substances in extracts and essential oils may react with microorganisms and restrain microbial growth.
4: 19 Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the chemical composition, antioxidant and antibacterial activity of  Bunium persicum,  Eucalyptus globulus, and rose water on multidrug-resistant  Listeria species.
