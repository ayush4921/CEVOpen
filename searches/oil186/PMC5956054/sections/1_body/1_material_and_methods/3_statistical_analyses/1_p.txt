0: All analyses were performed at least duplicated or triplicated.
1: The results of the samples obtained from various sample suppliers are expressed as means and SD.
2: One-way analysis of variance was fitted to the data.
3: LSD was calculated for pairwise comparisons.
4: If the difference between two samples is higher than LSD, the difference is statistically significant at 5% level.
5: Because of imbalance of sample sizes, LSD will vary between comparisons.
6: Median LSD was reported (=typically LSD for comparison where sample with  n = 1 was compared to sample where  n = 3).
7: SAS 9.3. was used to fit the model (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, USA).
