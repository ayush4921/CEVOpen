0: PTZ was used to induce tonic-clonic convulsions  [23].
1: PTZ (85 mg/kg, i.p.)
2: was administered to different groups of mice (n = 5), which were pretreated with 5% Tween 80, oil (50,100 or 200 mg/kg) or diazepam (1 mg/kg) for 30 min.
3: Each mouse in each group was individually monitored for incidence of convulsions, latency of convulsions, death and mortality.
4: Mice that survived beyond 30 min after PTZ injection were considered protected  [24].
5: Cut-off time of 1800 s was used for mice that did not convulse or died within 30 min for the purpose of statistical analysis.
