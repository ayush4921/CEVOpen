0: Acute toxicity (LD 50) of EOCL was determined as described by  [15] via both oral and intraperitoneal routes.
1: Three doses (10, 100 and 1000 mg/kg) of emulsified EOCL were administered to three different groups of mice (n = 3).
2: In the second phase, doses of 1000, 2000, 2900 and 5000 mg/kg (n = 1) were used for the oral route because there was no mortality at 1000 mg/kg in this route; while 400, 600, 800 and 1000 mg/kg (n = 1) were used for the intraperitoneal route because there was 100% mortality at 1000 mg/kg in the first phase for this route.
3: The animals were monitored for 2 h and incidence of mortality recorded after 24 h for each group.
4: The LD 50 values were calculated with the following formula: LD  50 = (A x B), Where A and B represent maximum non-lethal and minimum lethal doses respectively
