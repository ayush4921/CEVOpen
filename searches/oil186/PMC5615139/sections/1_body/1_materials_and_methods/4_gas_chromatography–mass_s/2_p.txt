0: EOCL (0.5 mg/mL in CH 2Cl 2) was analyzed by GCMS (Focus-ISQ, Thermo Scientific).
1: Separation was achieved using a ZB5 ms capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm , Phenomenex) and a temperature program of 40 C (2 min) ramped to 250 C (10 m) at 5 C/min.
2: The eluted compounds were identified by determining the Kovat indices, spectral matching with the 2008 National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) spectral library and known standard and literatures  [13],  [14].
