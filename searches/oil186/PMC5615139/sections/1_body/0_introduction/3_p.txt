0: Several pharmacological properties have been reported for curcumin, a major component of the alcohol extract of  C. longa and  C. domestica rhizomes  [8].
1: The essential oil of  C. longa has been reported to contain monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, alcohols and ketones  [9],  [3],  [10].
2: Terpinolene and -phellandrene have been identified as the predominant constituents of leaf oil of a Nigerian grown  C. longa[11], while  [12] reported a different chemotype -tumerone from Southwest Nigeria.
3: The main focus of previous research study was on the anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anti-diabetic and other nutritional properties of the plant as well as on curcumin, ethanolic extract of the rhizome.
4: However, there has been no report on the central nervous system effects of the plant, this study therefore aimed at evaluating the  in-vivo neuropharmacological activity, determine the acute toxicity profile and investigate the chemical composition of the essential oil of the studied species since there were different chemotypes of the Nigerian  C longa.
5: Therefore this study reveals the contribution of the plants volatile component to its central nervous system activities, toxicological profile and provides rationale for its ethnomedicinal uses.
