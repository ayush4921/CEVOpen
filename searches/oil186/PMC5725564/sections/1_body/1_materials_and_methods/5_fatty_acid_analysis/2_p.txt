0: The oil extracted from each sample was converted to the methyl ester using the method described by Adeyeye and Adesina [ 7].
1: A 50 mg aliquot of the dried oil was saponified for 5 min at 95C with 3.4 ml of 0.5 M KOH in dry methanol.
2: The mixture was neutralized by 0.7 M HCl and 3 ml of 14% boron trifloride in methanol was added.
3: The mixture was heated for 5 min at 90C to achieve complete methylation.
4: The fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed using an HP 6890 gas chromatograph powered with HP Chemistation Rev.
5: a 09.01 (1206) software fitted with a flame ionization detector and a computing integrator.
6: Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas.
7: The column initial temperature was 250C rising at 5C/min to a final temperature of 310C, while the injection port and the detector were maintained at 310C and 350C, respectively.
8: A polar (HP INNO Wax) capillary column (30 m  0.53 mm  0.25 m) was used to separate the esters.
9: The peaks were identified by comparison with standard fatty acid methyl esters obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis MO, USA) [ 8].
10: However, the quantitative evaluation was carried out on the basis of gas chromatography peak areas of the different methyl esters.
11: The heptadecanoic ester was used to calculate the response factor for fatty acids which was found to be 0.96.
12: Three determinations were made for each sample.
