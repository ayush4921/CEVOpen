0: The phytosterol analysis was done as described by AOAC [ 6].
1: The aliquots of the extracted fat were added to the screw - capped test tubes.
2: The samples were saponified at 90C for 30min, using 3 ml of 10% KOH in ethanol, to which 0.20 mL of benzene was added to ensure miscibility.
3: Deionized water (3 mL) was added and 2 mL of hexane was added in extracting the non  saponifiable materials.
4: Three different extrations, each with 2 mL of hexane were carried out for 1h, 30min and 30min, respectively.
5: The hexane was concentrated to 1 mL in the vial for gas chromatography analysis and 1 L was injected into the injection pot of GC.
6: The GC conditions of analyses were similar to the GC conditions for methyl esters analyses [ 8].
