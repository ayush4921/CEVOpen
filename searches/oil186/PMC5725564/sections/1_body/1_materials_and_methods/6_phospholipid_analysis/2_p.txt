0: The phospholipid content of the pulp and seed oils was determined by gas chromatography (GC).
1: 0.01 g of the extracted fats was added to the test tube.
2: To ensure complete dryness of the oil for phospholipids analysis, the solvent was completely removed by passing the stream of the nitrogen gas on the oil.
3: 0.04 mL of chloroform was added to the content of the tube and it was followed by the addition of 0.10 mL of chromogenic solution.
4: The content of the tube was heated at a temperature of 100C in a water bath for about 1 min.
5: The content was allowed to cool, 5 mL of the hexane was added and the tube with its content shook gently several times.
6: The solvent and the aqueous layers were recovered and allowed to be separated.
7: The hexane layer was recovered and allowed to be concentrated to 1.0 mL for gas chromatography using flame photometric detector.
8: The conditions for phospholipid analysis include: H.P 5890 powered with HP ChemStation REV.
9: A 09.01 (1206) and split injection ratio of 20:1, nitrogen as carrier gas, inlet temperature 250C, column type HP5, column dimension: 30 m  0.25 mm  0.25 m, oven program: initial temperature at 50C, first ramping at 10C/min for 20 min, maintained for 4 min while second ramping at 15C/min for 4 min, maintained for 5 min.
10: Detector: PFPD Detector temperature was 300C, hydrogen pressure being 20 psi, compressor air being 35 psi [ 8].
