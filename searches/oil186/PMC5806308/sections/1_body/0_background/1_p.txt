0: In Mexico, diverse plants have been utilized in traditional medicine in the treatment of several diseases, as well as in the treatment of cuts, cutaneous infections, wounds and burns [ 1,  2].
1: These presumptive curative properties may be attributable to secondary metabolites that the plants possess which are distributed in leaves, flowers, stems, seeds or roots [ 2].
2: Among the plants that have been reported to exert these biological activities are those that belong to the family  Lamiaceae such as  Ocimum micranthum Willd [ 3].
3: For other species of the genus  Ocimum such as  sanctum linn,  gratissimum linn,  kilimandscharicum wound healing properties of its crude extracts, and essential oil have been reported [ 4 6]; in the case of the crude extracts of the species  micranthum, in vitro tests on healthy cell lines that support the therapeutic benefits of these extracts on wound healing and cutaneous infections have yet to be reported.
4: Moreover, studies have not addressed the potential antimicrobial activity of these extracts against pathological microorganisms.
