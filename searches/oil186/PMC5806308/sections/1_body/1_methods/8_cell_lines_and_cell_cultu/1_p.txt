0: Two cell lines were used in this study, healthy human breast-derived fibroblasts (hFB) and adherent Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1, Gibco, USA), this last cell line is a classic model of cytotoxic tests and proliferative assays due to its capacity of adaptation in adherent mode or suspension [ 19].
1: Both cell lines were routinely grown in DMEM F12 medium (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, USA) at 37 C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2.
