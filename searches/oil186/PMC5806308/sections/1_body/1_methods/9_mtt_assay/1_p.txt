0: The effect of the essential oil and the aqueous and ethanolic extracts of  Ocimum micranthum leaves on CHO-K1 and hFB cell lines was assessed using the tetrazolium colorimetric MTT assay [ 20].
1: The cells were seeded at a density 2  10 4 cells/well in 96-well microtiter plates and incubated at 37 C and 5% CO 2 in a humidified environment for 24 h. Subsequently, 100 L of six different concentrations of each extract was added to the wells, and the plates were incubated for 48 h. The final concentrations of the extracts in the wells were 0.0075%, 0.015%, 0.03%, 0.06%, 0.125% and 0.25% for essential oil; 0.25%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 4%,8% for aqueous extract and 0.0075%, 0.015%, 0.03%, 0.06%, 0.125% and 0.25% for ethanolic extract.
2: After that, 10 l of MTT solution (5 mg/ml in RPMI-1640 without phenol red, Sigma Aldrich) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 37 C for 2 h. Following the incubation period, 100 L of MTT solvent (0.1 N HCl in anhydrous isopropanol) was added to the wells to solubilize the formazan crystals.
3: Multiskan FC (Thermo Scientific) microplate reader at 570 nm was used for the measurement of the absorbance.
4: The measurement of the color control of all concentrations of each extract was carried out to ensure that no interference occurred in the measurement of each well.
5: The percentage of relative cell proliferation was calculated based on a comparison with untreated cells (control) as [extract absorbance/control absorbance]  100.
6: Microscopic viewing of the cell cultures was performed before and after the assay using an inverted microscope Axio Vert 200 (Carl Zeiss) coupled to a video camera.
