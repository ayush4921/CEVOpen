0: For the McFarland turbidimetric analysis [ 17], a wavelength of 590 nm was used.
1: The absorbance values of this test were correlated with the absorbance values from the growth kinetics of each microorganism tested.
2: This correlation was used to calculate the time taken by each microorganism to reach the exponential phase and the concentration of microorganism necessary to carry out the microdilution test.
3: The value recorded in the present study was 0.50 on the McFarland scale which is equivalent to 1.5  10 8 CFU/mL.
4: In the growth kinetics, a pre-inoculum of each microorganism was incubated for 2021 h at 35 C in agitation.
5: The culture medium used for this purpose were brain heart infusion (BHI) broth for  S. aureus and  B. subtilis, nutritive broth ( P. aeruginosa) and sabouraud broth ( C. albicans).
6: The absorbance was measured every 2 h during a period of 16 h using a spectrophotometer model GENESYS 20 (Thermo Scientific) at a wavelength of 590 nm.
