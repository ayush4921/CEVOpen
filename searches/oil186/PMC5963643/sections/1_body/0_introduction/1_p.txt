0: In all aerobic organisms, including human beings, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is balanced by antioxidant defense system.
1: A serious imbalance between the production of ROS and antioxidant defense system is responsible for oxidative stress.
2: Thus, ROS plays an important role in the etiology of many diseases and aging.
3: Antioxidant defense system which prevents oxidative damages of ROS consist of flavanoids, carotenoids, phenolic compounds, vitamins, and antioxidant enzymes ( 1).
4: Although there are some synthetic antioxidants such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) which is commonly used in processed food, it has been reported that these compounds have some side effects ( 2).
5: Recently, there has been increasing interest in finding plants with high antioxidant capacities since they can protect human body from free radicals and retard the progression of many chronic diseases ( 3- 5).
