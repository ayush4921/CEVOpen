0: The air-filled cavities of sinuses is one of host defense system, which act by classical, pseudostratified and ciliated columnar epithelium.
1: When one or more of paranasal sinuses become inflamed, sinusitis occurs.
2: Classically, there are four types of sinusitis including acute, sub-acute, chronic and recurrent ones.
3: The infection of paranasal sinuses, which occur 10 days and less than 4 weeks is defined as acute sinusitis.
4: The inflammatory diseases of sinuses, much similar to asthma is chronic sinusitis.
5: Viral upper respiratory infection leads to inflammation of sinuses, damaging the mucosa and defective performance of cilia, which prone the environment to bacterial infections 1.
6: Rhinoviruses,  Streptococcus pneumonia,  Haemophilus influenza, and  Moraxella catarrhalis are the majority pathogens of acute sinusitis  2,  3.
7: In spite of inflammatory nature of acute sinusitis, the involved bacterial pathogens of acute sinusitis,  Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative  Staphylococci are found in chronic sinusitis  4.
8: Postnasal drip, greenish nasal discharge, nasal congestion, tenderness of the face under the eyes or at the bridge of the nose, frontal headaches, pain in teeth, cough and fever are common symptoms of sinusitis.
9: Antibiotics (amoxicillin, doxycycline, cephalexin and cefadroxil, etc.)
10: are prescribed for 85-98% of patients with acute sinusitis  5,  6,  7.
11: Nasal corticosteroids, and anti-histamines are used in patients with sneezing or rhinitis.
12: Corticosteroids and antibiotics are used in chronic sinusitis  8.
13: The appearance of antibiotic resistant pathogens to chemical agents along with the adverse effects of drugs encourage the scientists to search among the medicinal plants.
14: One of popular plants in traditional medicines for management of sinusitis and clinical symptoms is  Nigella sativa seeds.
