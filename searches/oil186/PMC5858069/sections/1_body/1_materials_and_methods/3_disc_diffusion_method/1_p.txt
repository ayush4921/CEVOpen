0: Assessment of the antimicrobial activity of essential oils was done using the well-plate method.
1: Standard strain  E. faecalis (ATCC51299) was used for this purpose.
2: After culturing  E. faecalis in blood agar medium, 0.5 McFarland microbial suspension in saline was prepared.
3: For this purpose, 0.5 mL of 1.175% barium chloride solution was added to 99.5 mL of 1% sulfuric acid.
4: Next, bacterial suspension was streak cultured on Mueller-Hinton agar using a cotton swab.
5: Wells were created in the plate using a sterile Pasteur pipette, and 50 L of each essential oil was inoculated into the wells.
6: After 15 min, the plates were incubated at 35C37C for 1824 h. The diameter of the growth inhibition zone was measured by a ruler and reported in millimeters.
7: Gentamycin was used as control in disc diffusion method.
