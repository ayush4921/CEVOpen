0: To determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of essential oils, micro-broth dilution method was used; 5% dimethyl sulfoxide was used to dissolve the essential oils.
1: In addition, 100 L of fresh culture medium was added to nine wells of each row.
2: These materials were added to the first well to reach a final concentration of 1:200 (v/v) (1 L of essential oil + 10 L of dimethyl sulfoxide + 89 L of the culture medium).
3: Next, 100 L of the first well was removed and added to the second well and mixed by pipetting up and down ten times.
4: The same was repeated for the next wells and 100 L of the 7 th well was discarded (not added to the 8 th well).
5: The 8 th well served as the positive control (contained bacteria without essential oils) and the 9 th well served as the negative control (without essential oils or bacteria to control for sterility).
6: Next, 100 L of microbial suspension was added to the 8 th well and 100 L of sterile culture medium was added to the 9 th well.
7: Serial dilutions of essential oils (1:200, 1:400, 1:800, 1:1600, 1:3200, 1:6400, and 1:12800 v/v) were prepared as follows; 100 L of 0.5 McFarland standard concentration of the microbial suspension was added to each well and the plate was incubated at 37C for 1824 h. Minimum concentration of essential oil with no turbidity was considered as the MIC.
8: For MBCs with this culture (subculture) of transparent tubes (no growth), MIC test was performed and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) as the concentration that kills 99.9% or more of the initial inoculation is considered.
