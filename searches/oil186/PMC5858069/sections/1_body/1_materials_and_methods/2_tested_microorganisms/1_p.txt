0: S. mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, and  Lactobacillus acidophilus strains were obtained and microbiologically approved.
1: Microorganisms were stored in brainheart infusion broth containing 15% glycerol (v/v) at 80C.
2: Before the experiment, microbial suspension was transferred to nutrient broth and incubated overnight at 37C.
3: The turbidity of the inoculum suspension was adjusted at 0.5 McFarland standard concentration to achieve 1.5  10 8 colony-forming units/ml.
4: Double-seriated dilution in 0.1% (w/v) suspension of peptan in distilled water in nutrient agar was used to ensure the viability of microorganisms.
