0: The main goal of modern dentistry is to maintain the function of the masticatory system throughout one's life.
1: This goal is hard to achieve without endodontic therapy in most patients.
2: [ 1]  Enterococci are responsible for most of the primary infections of the root canal system.
3: They have been isolated from many treated root canals with chronic apical periodontitis and failed root canal treatment.
4: [ 2] These bacteria are capable of invading the dentinal tubules.
5: They can tolerate different ecological conditions, well adapt to unfavorable intracanal environment, and are multidrug resistant.
6: Enterococci are highly sensitive to sodium hypochlorite and also chlorhexidine (CHX).
7: However, their sensitivity decreases with a reduction in the concentration of these antimicrobial agents.
8: [ 3] Since inadequate cleaning and shaping as well as debris pushed into the root canal are among the factors responsible for root canal treatment failure, different irrigating solutions are used for cleaning and disinfection of the root canal system.
9: [ 4] Irrigating solutions must have low cytotoxicity and surface tension, adequate flow, and sustained antimicrobial activity.
10: Moreover, they must be easily accessible and affordable and have a pleasant odor.
11: An irrigating solution with high antimicrobial activity and insignificant adverse effects is obviously preferred.
12: [ 5]
