0: The effect of microbial burden on healing of chronic wound is not completely understood and it is probably underestimated.
1: 2 The presence of a biofilm was indicated as a critical factor and a correlation between depth and duration of the lesion and the presence of  Staphylococcus strains was demonstrated.
2: 4 Moreover, microbial wound colonization (typically due to  Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes, and some  Clostridium strains) was proved responsible for a further delay in wound recovery.
