0: Wound repair is one of the most complex physiologic processes, involving a multitude of different cell types, the contribution of which is tightly regulated over time.
1: The breakdown of such a complex path could result in wound healing failure, leading to nonhealing wounds.
2: The typical path of wound repair includes overlapping stages of inflammation, new tissue generation, and subsequent remodeling of neoformed tissue.
3: These stages take place over dramatically different timescales, lasting from minutes (initial clotting and coagulation) to several months or even years.
