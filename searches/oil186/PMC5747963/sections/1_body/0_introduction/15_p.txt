0: Nanoparticles were characterized for physicalchemical properties, bioadhesion, cytocompatibility, in vitro proliferation enhancement, and wound healing properties toward normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF).
1: Antimicrobial activity of nanoparticles was evaluated against two reference microbial strains, one of  Staphylococcus aureus, the other  of Streptococcus pyogenes.
2: Finally, the capability of nanoparticles to promote wound healing in vivo was evaluated on a rat burn model.
