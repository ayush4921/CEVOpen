0: Resident cells are less proliferating in chronic wounds and possess a morphology similar to that of senescent cells.
1: In particular, fibroblasts of chronic wounds (long-lasting vascular leg ulcers) are characterized by a poorer response to platelet-derived growth factor, altered capability of transforming growth factor beta type II receptor expression, and abnormal phosphorylation of critical signal transduction proteins.
2: Such features are typical of cells exposed to low oxygen tension, suggesting that chronic wounds are hypoxic.
