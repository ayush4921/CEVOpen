0: In each well of a 96-well plate, 210 4 fibroblasts/well were seeded and grown 24 h to obtain subconfluence.
1: Afterwards, cell substrates were put in contact with 200 L of each sample.
2: Nanoparticle suspensions and nanoparticle suspensions containing 5% w/w pull, as described in the section Lipid nanoparticle preparation, were diluted with GM in a 1/100 w/w ratio.
3: Cells kept in contact with GM were considered as positive control (standard growth conditions).
4: After 48 h contact, an MTT test was performed as previously described.
