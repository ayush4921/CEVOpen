0: Then cells were washed with saline solution and subsequently put in contact with 200 L of each sample.
1: Nanoparticle suspensions, as described in the section Lipid nanoparticle preparation, were diluted with GM in a 1/20, 1/40, and 1/100 w/w ratio.
2: In the case of 1/100 dilution, nanoparticle suspensions containing 5% w/w pull, as described in the section Lipid nanoparticle preparation, were also examined and cytocompatibility was compared with that of 5% w/w pull solution diluted 1/100 with GM.
3: Cells kept in contact with GM were considered as positive control (standard growth conditions).
4: After 3 h contact, an MTT test was performed.
5: This test is based on the activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenases of vital cells, which convert MTT to formazan.
6: One hundred twenty-five microliters of MTT solution (Sigma Aldrich) at 0.25 g/mL concentration in Hanks buffered salt solution pH 7.4 was put in contact with each sample for 3 h. The reagent was then removed from each well and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (150 L) to remove the samples and the unreacted MTT solution.
7: After PBS removal, 100 L of dimethyl sulfoxide was put in each well and the absorbance was assayed at 570 nm by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (Imark Absorbance Reader, Biorad, Milan, Italy), with a reference wavelength set at 655 nm.
8: Cell viability was calculated as % ratio between the absorbance of cells treated with a sample and the absorbance of the cells kept in contact with the control, GM.
