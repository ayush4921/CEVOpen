0: All experiments on animals were carried out in full compliance with the standard international ethical guidelines (European Communities Council Directive 86/609/EEC), approved by Italian Health Ministry (D.L.
1: 116/92).
2: The study protocol was approved by the Local Institutional Ethics Committee of the University of Pavia for the use of animals.
3: Male rats (Wistar 200250 g) were anesthetized with equitensine at 3 mL/kg (39 mM pentobarbital, 256 mM chloral hydrate, 86 mM MgSO 4, 10% ethanol v/v, and 39.6% propyleneglycol v/v) and shaved to remove all hair from their backs.
4: Three circular full-thickness burns, having a diameter of 4 mm, were produced on the back of the animals by contact with an aluminum rod (105C for 40 s).
5: Twenty-four hours later, the formed blisters were removed using a 4-mm diameter biopsy punch to obtain full-thickness lesions.
6: Either 20 L of nanoparticles suspension or 20 L of nanoparticles suspension containing 5% w/w pull as described in the section Lipid nanoparticle preparation, was applied to the lesions.
7: Lesions treated with 20 L of saline solution were considered as control.
8: After treatment, each lesion was protected with a sterile gauze and the rats back was wrapped with a surgery stretch (Safety, Bovisio Masciago, Italy).
9: At prefixed times after blister removal (0, 3, 7, 10, 14, and 18 days), photographs of the lesions were taken by a digital camera (Sigma SD 14, Sigma Corporation, Milan, Italy), which allowed sizing of the lesions and monitoring the healing process.
10: Each treatment was repeated after each photograph.
11: The dimensions of wounded area were determined by an image analysis software (ICY, Institute Pasteur, Paris, France).
