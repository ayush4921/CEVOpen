0: The antimicrobial properties of nanoparticles and eucalyptus EO dispersed in lecithin solution at the same concentration of nanoparticles were assessed against the following reference bacterial strains:  Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 and  Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615.
1: Before testing, bacteria were grown overnight in Tryptone Soya Broth (Oxoid, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy) at 37C and in Todd Hewitt Broth (Oxoid, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37C in the presence of 5% CO 2 in the case of  Streptococcus pyogenes.
2: The cultures were centrifuged at 224  g for 20 min, to separate microorganisms from culture broth and then washed with sterile distilled water.
3: Washed cells were resuspended in Dulbeccos PBS and optical density at 650 nm wavelength was adjusted to 0.2, corresponding approximately to 110 7110 8 colony-forming units/mL.
4: The antimicrobial activity was determined with the macrodilution broth method, according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines (2009), with some modifications.
5: The desired sample concentration was achieved by adding in 15100 mm test tubes an appropriate sample volume (nanoparticle suspension, as described in the section Lipid nanoparticle preparation) to 1 mL of double-concentrate isoSensitest broth (Oxoid, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy).
6: Bacterial suspensions were added to the test tubes.
7: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was evaluated after 24 h incubation at 37C as the lowest concentration that completely inhibited the formation of visible microbial growth.
8: Control test tubes contained microorganisms in culture broth without nanoparticles.
9: Various concentrations of each sample were tested.
