0: Fibroblasts were seeded in each chamber at 10 5 cells/cm 2 concentration and grown at confluence in standard conditions as previously described.
1: After 24 h, cells reached confluence and the insert was removed displaying two areas of cell substrates divided by the gap.
2: The cell substrates were put in contact with 200 L of each sample.
3: Nanoparticle suspensions and nanoparticle suspensions containing 5% w/w pull, as described in the section Lipid nanoparticle preparation, diluted with GM in a 1/100 w/w ratio were tested.
4: Cells kept in contact with GM were considered as control.
5: At prefixed times (0 and 48 h), microphotographs were taken to evaluate cell migration in the gap.
