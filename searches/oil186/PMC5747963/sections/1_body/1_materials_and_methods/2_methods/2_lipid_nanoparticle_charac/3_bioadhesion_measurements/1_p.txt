0: Bioadhesion measurements were carried out using a texture analyzer apparatus (TA.XT plus, Stable Microsystems, ENCO, Spinea, Italy) equipped with a 1 kg load cell, a cylinder probe having a diameter of 10 mm (P10), and the A/MUC measuring system.
1: 18, 19 The A/MUC measuring system consists of a support in which a biologic substrate can be fixed.
2: In this case, the biologic substrate chosen to mimic damaged skin was an egg shell membrane, 18 wetted with 100 L of isotonic saline (NaCl 0.9% w/v).
3: To recover the membrane, the egg shell was placed in a 0.5 M HCl solution for 1 h. The A/MUC system was thermoset at 32C.
4: One hundred microliters of each nanosystem containing 5% w/w of pull, as described in the section Lipid nanoparticle preparation, and 5%/w pull solution, as control, were placed onto the cylinder probe covered by filter paper disc and the sample and the biologic substrate were put in contact under a preload of 2.5 N for 3 min.
