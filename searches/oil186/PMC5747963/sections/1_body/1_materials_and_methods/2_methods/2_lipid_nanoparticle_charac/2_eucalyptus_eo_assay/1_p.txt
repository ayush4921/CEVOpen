0: Loading of eucalyptus EO in lipid carriers was determined by means of head space solid phase microextraction (HSSPME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (according to eucalyptus oil  07/2010:0390, Eur Ph.
1: 9.0 Ed monograph).
2: The following HSSPME experimental parameters were used: sample amount, 100 L; water addition, 10 mL; fiber polydimethylsiloxane (100 m); extraction temperature, 40C; extraction time, 30 min; desorption temperature, 280C; desorption time, 5 min.
