0: In contrast to common cultivation, in the current study, clones were used in order to have plants with known analytical and identical genetic backgrounds.
1: Plants of seed propagated valerian populations would probably vary too much in the contents of secondary compounds [ 34].
2: Therefore, the four elite plants were cloned by sterile micropropagation using inflorescences at an early bud stage as starting tissue and side shoots as propagation parts.
3: Rooted plantlets were cultivated for 2 years in the field of the experimental station Baumannshof of the Bavarian State Research Center for Agriculture (4842N /1132E, 360 m MSL).
4: A detailed description of the plant material, the cloning by in vitro propagation and the cultivation conditions are described in Penzkofer et al.
5: [ 19], where the same plant material was used.
