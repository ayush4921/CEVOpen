0: Due to the age of the plants, flowering was induced and shoots started to develop in spring of the harvest year.
1: The inflorescence development influences the essential oil content and causes a decrease of the essential oil content from summer to autumn [ 35].
2: Therefore, the inflorescences were cut off in an early stage of development to counteract the decline [ 36].
3: Our plant material was harvested in autumn (2014), the usual harvest time for valerian cultivation.
4: At least one cloned plant of each elite was dug out carefully and the adventitious roots were separated into four diameter fractions (< 2,<  3,< 4, > 4 mm; Table  1).
5: The fresh roots were stored in air-tight containers at 56  C to prevent dehydration of the roots and a loss of essential oil.
6: Prior to preparation for microscopy, the roots were washed carefully with water.
