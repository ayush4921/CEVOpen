0: For statistical analysis, in each class, the mean number of oil droplets of the root-slices was determined.
1: The distribution of these oil droplets as affected by the horizons, the root diameter fractions, the root classification and the genotypes, were compared with the Friedman-Test and Wilcox-Test.
2: To compare the different factor levels, such as different genotypes (CE), root diameter fractions (RF) or horizons (HZ), the oil droplet density for each root-slice was calculated.
3: An analysis of variance (ANOVA) and  t Test was performed.
4: For all statistical analyses, significance was given at  p <  0.05.
