0: The relative distance data was assigned to one of nine classes with a class width of 11.11%; this led to the interval limits for class 1 = [011.10%); class 2 = [11.1122.21%); class 3 = [22.2233.32%); class 4 = [33.3344.43%); class 5 = [44.4455.54%); class 6 = [55.5566.65%); class 7 = [66.6677.76%); class 8 = [77.7788.87%); class 9 = [88.88100%].
1: Figure  3B shows a generalized illustration of the nine classes.
2: Class 1 was always within the central cylinder; class 2 delineated mostly the border of the central cylinder.
3: The area of both classes together was addressed as central cylinder.
4: The classes 38 comprised the parenchyma, class 9 the outer cell layers.
5: The area of the classes increased from the center to the edge.
6: Therefore, both the number of oil droplets in each class and the oil droplet density were determined to compare the classes.
7: The density was calculated as the quotient of number of oil droplets over the class area.
