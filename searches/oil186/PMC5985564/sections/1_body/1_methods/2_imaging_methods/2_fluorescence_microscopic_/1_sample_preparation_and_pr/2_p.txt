0: The cutting of thin root-slices was done by hand with a height adjustable cylinder-microtome.
1: A segment of the respective root diameter fraction and horizon was clamped between a buffer-material, cut out from a carrot root parenchyma.
2: This material has a comparable structure and consistency to the examined valerian roots.
3: Thereby, the fresh valerian roots were well enclosed.
4: With a moderate pressure, a constant velocity and without displacement, a straight metallic blade was moved through the valerian root tissue.
5: The cut was performed in a constant angle of 20.
6: Through the moveable and height adjustable hanger, thin root-slices of a uniform thickness of 0.2 mm were able to be produced.
7: These root-slices were then placed on top of a drop of water on a microscope slide.
8: From each horizon, 1520 thin-sections were cut, but just a low number of slices (seven on average) were suitable for the following image processing, analysis and evaluation.
