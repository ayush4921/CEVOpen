0: For data evaluation, the determined xy-coordinates were adapted and related to each other.
1: The coordinates of the centers were used as new coordinate origins (formula Ia and Ib) and the distances of the oil droplets and the edges related to the center were calculated with Formula  II.
2: This was only achievable when the center, the oil droplet and the corresponding point of the root edge all lay on an imaginary line.
3: An example is shown in Fig.
4: 3A.
5: The corresponding point of the root edge was calculated with help of the polar angle, which must be the same for the distance between the center and the oil droplet (CD in Fig.
6: 3A) and for the distance between the center and the corresponding point of the edge (CE in Fig.
7: 3A).
8: The polar angle of both distances was calculated with Formula  III.
9: At last, the relative distances of the oil droplets and the root edges to the center were determined (Formula  IV).
10: This data was used for the evaluation.
