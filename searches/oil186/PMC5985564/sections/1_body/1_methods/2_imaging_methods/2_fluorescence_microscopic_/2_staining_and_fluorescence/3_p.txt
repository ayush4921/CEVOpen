0: The green fluorescence oil droplets were imaged with a high-contrast against the black background.
1: Despite all precautions taken, the root-slices did not always have exactly the same thickness and the cytoplasm of the cut cells was more or less leaked, so that the light transmittance of the cell layers varied among and within the root-slices.
2: In order to make the oil droplets clearly visible in all areas of the root slice, brightness and contrast were adjusted through the camera software (ZEISS AxioVison, Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany) by one to two units, upwards or downwards, for each image.
3: The depth of focus on the microscope was not changed so that the same cell layer was shown on each image.
