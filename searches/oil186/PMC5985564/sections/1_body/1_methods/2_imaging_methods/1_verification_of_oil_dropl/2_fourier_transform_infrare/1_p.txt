0: Thin-section slices of 0.01 mm thickness were made by a freezing microtome (Leica CM 1100, Leica Biosystems Nussloch GmbH, Nussloch, Germany).
1: Each slice was screened for colorless round bodies by light microscopy that was integrated in the FTIR spectrometer.
2: Sections with round bodies were subsequently analyzed applying FTIR imaging.
3: FTIR transmission spectra of the thin-section slices were recorded with the FTIR spectrometer Varian 4100 FTIR (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany) combined with the IR-microscope Varian UMA 600 (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany).
4: The thin-section slices were placed on a ZnSe window and FTIR images were produced with a 32  32 focal plane array detector (FPA).
5: The spectra were recorded over the wavelength range of 4000850 cm 1 and 128 scans per spectrum were accumulated.
