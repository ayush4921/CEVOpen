0: Our intention was to give a more detailed histochemical description within the valerian roots.
1: The development of an appropriate method to visualize and clearly identify the essential oil droplets required several consecutive steps grouped into two fields: (k) Verification of oil droplets and (kk) generation of an essential oil distribution map.
2: Verification of the oil droplets (k) was done by light-microscopic imaging and subsequent confirmation of the essential oil in the found oil droplets by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) imaging.
3: Based on the results of these investigations, fluorescence-microscopic imaging for generating oil droplet maps (kk) could be applied.
