0: To counteract the losses of root mass and secondary compounds during harvesting, cleaning and the further production process of dried valerian roots, breeding was started in 2008 to develop new varieties of valerian with a coarser root-system (thicker adventitious roots) and with high contents of secondary compounds.
1: A coarser root system would probably preserve the secondary compounds, essential oil and valerenic acid [ 9].
2: According to the European Pharmacopoeia, the minimum content of essential oil must be 4 ml  kg 1 and of valerenic acid at 0.17% (m/m) [ 2].
3: The most frequent major constituents of essential oil of  Valeriana officinalis L. s.l.
4: are the monoterpenes borneol and its esters, bornyl acetate and bornyl isovalerate [ 10 15].
