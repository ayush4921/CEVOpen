0: Based on this, the study at hand was carried out to better understand the histochemical background of the two observations (i) and (ii).
1: Observation (i) must be well interpreted to assess the achievability of the breeding target of a thick root-system with good essential oil content.
2: Understanding the histological background of observation (ii) may explain why the entire essential oil is not all lost during a more robust, mechanized root harvesting and processing in large-scale valerian field production.
3: We postulated that a great part of the essential oil droplets occur in the inner parts of the valerian root.
