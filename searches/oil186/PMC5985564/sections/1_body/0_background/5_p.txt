0: The application of various vibrational spectroscopy methods for visualizing secondary metabolites in different plant tissue is already described for e.g.
1: polyacetylenes and carotenoids in carrots, or essential oil components in fennel, chamomile and curcuma [ 23 28].
2: The Fourier-transform infrared FITR imaging method allows one to study the occurrence and distribution of a wide range of molecules in cell tissues.
3: However, it has not yet been applied for the essential oil in valerian.
4: The fluorescence-microscopic method is suitable for the visualization and localization of secondary compounds in plant roots, and was used with sunflowers and mountain arnica [ 29 31].
5: Furthermore, a spectral-sensitive camera could make more oil droplet structures visible, or make chemical differentiation possible, respectively [ 32,  33].
