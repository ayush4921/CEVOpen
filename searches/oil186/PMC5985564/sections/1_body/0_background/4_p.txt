0: In contrast to the abundant analyses of pharmaceutical secondary compounds and their medicinal values, there are relatively few studies related to the physiology and localization within the root.
1: Zacharias [ 16] described essential oil to be located in [...] the outer exodermis [...], whereas Tschirch and Oesterle [ 17] found it in the [...] single-row hypodermis [...].
2: Both authors described one oil droplet in a single exodermis cell.
3: Localization of essential oil only in the outer cell layers of the valerian roots would support the two following observations made during the breeding of coarse valerian: (i) Considering 200 selected plants (elites), the essential oil content decreased with the increase of root thickness [ 18].
4: This behavior is explainable, because with increasing root diameter, the root surface area decreases in relation to the root volume (calculated as cylinder).
5: (ii) After careful hand-harvesting and hand-processing, high essential oil contents were achieved [ 19].
6: Due to careful handling, the surface was not damaged and the essential oil, close to the root surface, still present.
7: The presence of essential oil close to the root surface was confirmed by Holzner-Lendbrandl [ 20] und Fridvalszky [ 21], who additionally recognized small round bodies named oil sacs in the parenchyma of the roots.
8: These oil sacs were found predominantly in the outer parenchyma.
9: Violon et al.
10: [ 22] identified oil droplets also in the inner parenchyma.
11: All previous investigations remain vague about the oil droplet identification and distribution across the cross-section.
12: In addition, they do not give information concerning oil droplets among different varieties, at different root diameters on the same plant, or at different positions along the roots.
