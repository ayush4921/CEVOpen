1: 5Light-microscopic (   A) and FTIR images, of valerian root cross section showing high absorbance for mainly bornyl acetate at 1737 cm   1 (   B) and cellulose at 998 cm   1 (   C).
2: The spectrum was taken from the cross mark in the appropriate FTIR images for cellulose (   D).
3: Colors blue, green, yellow, and red represent increasing contentthe warmer the color, the higher the spectral intensity
