0: Fig.
1: 7Mean oil droplet density (number of oil droplets/mm   2), determined from root thin section slices of valerian.
2: Shown are four cloned elites (CE1, CE2, CE3, CE4) (   A), two root classifications (thin- and thick-rooted) (   B), four root diameter fractions (RF1, RF2, RF3, RF4) (   C) and three horizons (HZ1, HZ2, HZ3) (   D).
3: Further details of the cloned elites, the root classification, the root diameter fractions and horizons are shown in the text.
4: Vertical lines: standard deviation.
5: Significant codes: *< 0.05, **< 0.01, ***< 0.001.
6: Different small form letters mark significant differences between the oil droplet densities (   p <  0.05, SNK).
7: Number of root slices given in Table    2
