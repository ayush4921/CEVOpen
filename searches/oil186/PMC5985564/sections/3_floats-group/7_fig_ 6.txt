0: Fig.
1: 6Mean number (columns) and density (points; mean number/class area) of oil droplets, determined from root thin section slices of valerian and allocated in nine classes (19).
2: Shown are four cloned elites (CE1, CE2, CE3, CE4) (   A), two root classifications (thin- and thick-rooted) (   B), four root diameter fractions (RF1, RF2, RF3, RF4) (   C) and three root horizons (HZ1, HZ2, HZ3) (   D).
3: Vertical lines: standard deviation.
4: Significant codes: *< 0.05, **< 0.01, ***< 0.001.
5: The same capital and small form letters mark that the oil droplet mean numbers and the densities are equal (   p <  0.05, SNK), respectively.
6: The colored background marks the classes of the parenchyma.
7: Further details of the cloned elites, the root classification, the root diameter fractions, the horizons and the parenchyma are shown in the text
