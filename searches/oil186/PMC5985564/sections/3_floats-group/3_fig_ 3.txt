1: 3A Schematic illustration of a root-slice segment with the identified elements    center (C), oil    droplets (D, labeled is one oil droplet) and the root    edge (E).
2: indicates the polar angle with C as pole and the x-axis (horizontal line) as polar axis.
3: B Generalized illustration of the nine classes (19), to which the oil droplets (pp, Formula    IV) were assigned based on their relative distance to the center
