0: Stock solutions at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in methanol and Trolox were prepared from  R. chalepensis essential oils that were collected from three Palestinian regions.
1: Each one of these stock solutions was diluted in methanol to prepare 12 of the working solutions with the following concentrations: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 80, and 100  g/ml.
2: A freshly prepared DPPH solution (0.002% w/v) was mixed with both methanol and with each of the above-mentioned working solutions at 1 : 1 : 1 ratio.
3: In addition, a negative control solution was prepared by mixing the mentioned DPPH solution with methanol in 1 : 1 ratio.
4: All of these solutions were incubated at room temperature in a dark cabinet for 30 min.
5: By the end of the incubation period, the optical density of these solutions was determined spectrophotometrically at a wave length of 517 nm using methanol as the blank solution.
