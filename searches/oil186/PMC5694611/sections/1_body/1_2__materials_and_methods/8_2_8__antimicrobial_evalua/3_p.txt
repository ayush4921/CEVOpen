0: Each one of the isolated  R. chalepensis essential oils was dissolved in DMSO (5%) at a concentration of 132 mg/ml.
1: The prepared  R. chalepensis essential oils solutions were filter-sterilized and then were serially microdiluted (2-fold) eleven times in sterile nutrient broth.
2: In 96-well plates, the dilution processes were carried out under aseptic conditions.
3: In the microwells that were assigned to evaluate the antibacterial activities of the extracted  R. chalepensis essential oils, the concentration of these oils ranged from 0.129 to 66 mg/ml.
4: On the other hand, the concentrations of these essential oils in the microwells assigned to evaluate their antifungal activities ranged from 0.065 to 55 mg/ml.
5: In these plates, microwell number 11 contained essential oil free nutrient broth, which was used as a positive control for microbial growth.
6: In addition, the microwell number 12 contained essential oil free nutrient broth that was left uninoculated with any of the test microbes.
7: This well was used as a negative control for microbial growth.
8: Microwells number 1 to 11 were inoculated aseptically with the test microbes.
9: At the time of inoculation, the final concentrations of microbial cells were about 5  10 5 and 0.52.5  10 3 colony-forming unit (CFU)/ml for the tested bacterial pathogens and  Candida albicans, respectively.
10: Each of the included microbes in this study was examined in duplicate for being inhibited by the  R. chalepensis essential oils.
