0: The essential oils of the three samples of  R. chalepensis plant were isolated by using microwave-ultrasonic method which was described by Jaradat with minor modifications [ 44].
1: The powder suspension was exposed to ultrasonic waves to improve the isolation process.
2: In this study, the apparatus consisting of a microwave oven combined with an ultrasonic extractor was used.
3: About 100 g of the dried leaves powder was suspended in about 500 ml deionized water into a 1 L round bottom flask and placed in this apparatus and connected with Clevenger apparatus.
4: The power of the microwave-ultrasonic extractor apparatus was adjusted at 1000 W. The ultrasonic power of the apparatus was adjusted at its maximum power as well (50 W with a frequency of 40 kHz).
5: The isolation process using this apparatus was conducted for 10 min at 100C.
6: This process was repeated for three times for each plant sample.
7: The obtained essential oil was collected into a clean beaker, chemically dried, and stored in the refrigerator at 28C [ 7].
8: The obtained  R. chalepensis essential oils yield was 0.6% v/w from the Jenin sample, 1.3% v/w from the Hebron sample, and 1.6% v/w from the Jerusalem sample.
