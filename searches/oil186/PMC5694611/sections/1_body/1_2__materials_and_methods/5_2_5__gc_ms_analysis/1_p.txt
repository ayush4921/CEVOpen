0: The GC-MS chromatograms were recorded using Shimadzu QP-5000 GC-MS.
1: The GC was equipped with Rtx-5 ms column (30 m long, 0.25  m thickness, and 0.25 mm inner diameter).
2: Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 ml/min.
3: The injector temperature was 220C.
4: The oven temperature was programmed from 50C (1 min hold) at 5C/min to 130C and then at 10C/min to 250C and was kept isothermally for 15 min.
5: Transfer line temperature was 290C.
