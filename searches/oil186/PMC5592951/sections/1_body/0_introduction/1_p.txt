0: Nature is rich in antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant products.
1: Plants are considered as one of the important anti-organism producers.
2: Plants produce various types of secondary metabolites that are characterized by their biological properties, for use against predators and microbial pathogens.
3: One of these secondary metabolites, which have an effective antimicrobial activity, is the essential oil (EO).
4: 1 EOs, also known as essences, volatile oils, etheric oils, or aetheroleum, are natural products that can be produced from different parts of the plants (e.g., flowers, leaves, stems, seeds, fruit, or barks of aromatic plants).
5: The EOs consist of several types of compounds, which are usually liquid, volatile, limpid, with lower density than water, and soluble in organic solvents.
6: Extracting the EOs from different parts of the plants can be done by various chemical techniques such as steam distillation, solvent extraction, expression under pressure, supercritical fluid, and subcritical water extraction.
