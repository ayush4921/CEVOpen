0: In higher plants, fatty acids are synthesized  de novo in the stroma of plastids through a complex series of condensation reactions to produce either C16 or C18 fatty acids.
1: These fatty acids are then incorporated into the two glycerolipid synthetic pathways: the prokaryotic pathway and eukaryotic pathway [ 10, 11].
2: Chloroplast galactolipids contain substantial amounts of trienoic fatty acid, either the hexatrienoic acid (16:3) or 18:3, which may vary in different plant species [ 12].
3: In both glycerol pathways, desaturation of fatty acids is performed by a series of membrane-bound desaturases of the chloroplast and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [ 2, 11].
