0: Fatty acid desaturases are encoded by nuclear genes and differ in the substrate specificity and subcellular localization, and play critical roles in maintaining proper structure and cellular function of biological membranes [ 2, 13, 14].
1: Stearoyl ACP desaturase (SAD) is the only soluble desaturase, which convertes stearoyl-ACP (18:0-ACP) to oleic acid (18:1-ACP) by introducing the first double bond at the 9 th position from the carboxylic end of the fatty acyl chain in the process of fatty acid synthesis [ 14, 15].
2: Furhter desaturations are carried out by membrane-bound desaturases in the ER (FAD2 and FAD3) and the chloroplast (FAD4, FAD5, FAD6, FAD7, and FAD8) as we mentioned before.
3: FAD2 and FAD6 are -6 desaturases that synthesize linolenic acid (18:2) from oleic acid (18:1) by introduction of a double bond at the 12 th position from carboxylic end or 6 th position from the  end in the ER and plastid, respectively.
4: While, FAD3, FAD7, and FAD8 are -3 desaturases that desaturase 18:2 to 18:3 by inserting a double bond at the 15 th position from the carboxylic end or 3 rd position from the  end.
5: Moreover, the  FAD8 gene encodes a plastidial -3 desaturase that is cold-inducible, which can compensate the decreased expression of  FAD7 under the low temperature [ 16, 17].
6: FAD4 and FAD5 synthesize 16:1 from 16:0 specifically for the main component of chloroplast membrane phosphatidylglycerol and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, respectively [ 15].
