0: The genes encoding -3 fatty acid desaturases have been identified and studied from several plant species, such as Arabidopsis [ 16, 18, 19], soybean [ 11, 13, 20],  Zea mays [ 21], olive [ 1, 22], safflower ( Carthamus tinctorius L.) [ 23],  Jatropha curcas [ 24], and flax [ 25].
1: Microsomal FAD3 enzymes have been shown to be the major contributors to seed 18:3 content in Arabidopsis, soybean, and flax [ 14, 18, 20, 25].
2: On the contrary, the overexpression of a chloroplast -3 fatty acid desaturase was demonstrated to enhance the tolerance to low temperatures [ 26, 27].
3: Furthermore, overexpression of -3 fatty acid desaturases  BnFAD3 from  Brassica napus and  StFAD7 from  Solanum tuberosum in tomato enhanced resistance to cold stress, and altered fatty acid composition with an increase in the 18:3/18:2 ratio in leaves and fruits [ 28].
4: Increased desaturation of glycerolipids severs as compensation to cold-caused decrease in membrane fluidity [ 29, 30].
5: Thus, plant desaturases are very sensitive to several environmental cues such as temperature, light, or other factors [ 11, 31].
