0: In the present work, a chloroplast -3 fatty acid desaturase ( EgFAD8) and its promoter from oil palm has been isolated and characterized.
1: The expression pattern of  EgFAD8 in leaves and mesocarp at five developmental stages has been detected by Real-time quantitative PCR.
2: The  in vivo function of EgFAD8 has been verified by overexpression in  Saccharomyces cerevisiae (INVSc1) with exogenous linoleic acid (18:2).
3: To detect whether it could be induced by low temperature or the change of environment, we detected the efficiency of the  EgFAD8 promoter in transgenic Arabidopsis treated with low temperature and darkness, respectively.
4: These results revealed the function of  EgFAD8 and the feature of its promoter from high plants, which will be useful for understanding the role of -3 fatty acid desaturases from fruits grown in the tropical areas.
