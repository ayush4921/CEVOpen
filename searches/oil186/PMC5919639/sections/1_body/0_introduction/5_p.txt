0: Oil palm ( Elaeis guineensis Jacq.)
1: is the most productive oil-bearing crop in the world [ 32].
2: It is native to West Africa, but is now grown thuoughout the humid tropical lowlands [ 33, 34].
3: There are two major economic productions from oil palm fruits: palm oil extracted from the mesocarp and palm kernel oil from the endosperm [ 35, 36].
4: Palm oil contains oleate (18:1; 45%), linoleate (18:2; 8%), and 47% saturated fatty acid (43% of 16:0 and 4% of 18:0).
5: Therefore, much effort has been made to understand the oil synthesis in oil palm fruits and improve the fatty acid composition of palm oil since the high content of saturated fatty acid has been thought to be unhealthy to human [ 37].
6: The activity of a 12 fatty acid desaturase from oil palm has been tested in yeast, and it produced about 12% of linoleic acid in yeast, which barely exist in wild-type yeast cells [ 38].
7: Recently, the  in vivo function of a  DGAT2 gene from oil palm mesocarp has been verified in yeast and transgenic Arabidopsis, exhibiting a substrate preference towards unsaturated fatty acids [ 39].
