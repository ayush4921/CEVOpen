0: Linolenic acid (18:3) plays important roles in plant metabolism as a structural component of storage and membrane lipids, and as a precursor of signaling molecules involved in plant development and stress response [ 1, 2].
1: For human, alpha-linoenic acid (18:3 -3) is one of essential fatty acids, which are necessary for health and must be acquired from diet [ 3].
2: Moreover, 18:3 is a metabolic precursor for long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) synthesis [ 4], such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5 5,8,11,14,17, -3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6 4,7,10,13,16,19, -3).
3: They are essential constituents of human nutrition, and play key roles in brian and cardiovascular health [ 5 8].
4: However, the primary source of EPA and DHA is the marine product, especially fish oil [ 9].
