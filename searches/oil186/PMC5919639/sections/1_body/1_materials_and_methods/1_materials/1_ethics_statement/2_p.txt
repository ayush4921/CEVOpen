0: Oil palm fruits were collected from the Coconut Research Institute, Chinese Agricultural Academy of Tropical Crops, Wenchang, Hainan, China.
1: Fruits at five developmental stages (3060 days after pollination (DAP), 60100 DAP, 100-12- DAP, 120140 DAP, and 140160 DAP) were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C until use.
2: Wild-type  Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia was used in this study.
3: Arabidopsis plants were cultivated in a growth chamber at 23C with a 16-h photoperiod (16 h of 150 E m -2 sec -1 light and 8 h of darkness).
4: Yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae) strain INVSc1 (MAT ahis3 1 leu2 trp1-289 ura3-52/MAT  his3 1 leu2 trp1-289 ura3-52) and the high copy number shuttle vector pYES2 (Invitrogen, USA) were used for gene function analysis.
