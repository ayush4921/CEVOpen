0: For histochemical GUS staining, various tissues of Arabidopsis were incubated in GUS assay buffer with 2 mM X-Gluc, 5 mM K 3Fe(CN) 6, 100 mM Na 3PO 4 (pH 7.0), 5 mM K 4Fe(CN) 6, 0.2% Triton X-100 and 10 mM EDTA at 37C overnight under the darkness, and then cleared with 70% ethanol [ 47].
1: The samples were viewed by stereo-microscopy.
