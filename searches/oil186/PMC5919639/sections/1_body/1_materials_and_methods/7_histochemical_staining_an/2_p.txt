0: Quantitative analysis of GUS activity in transgenic Arabidopsis was determined according to Jefferson [ 47].
1: The protein concentrations of plant extracts were measured as descried by Bradford [ 48].
2: GUS activity was calculated as pmol 4-Methylumbelliferone (4-MU) per min per microgram protein.
3: Three replicates were performed for each sample.
