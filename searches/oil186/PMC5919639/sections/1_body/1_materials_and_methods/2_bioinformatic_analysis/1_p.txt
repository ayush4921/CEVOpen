0: Nucleotide and amino acid sequence analyses used the BLAST program and open reading frame (ORF) finder from NCBI website ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).
1: Amino acid alignment of fatty acid desaturases was performed by ClustalX 2.1 program with default setting [ 40].
2: A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method in MEGA5 [ 41].
3: Promoter prediction and  cis-acting regulatory element analysis were carried out on the PlantCARE ( http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html/) [ 42].
