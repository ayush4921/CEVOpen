0: Total RNA from mesocarp was extracted by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) based method as described previously [ 43].
1: First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 g of total RNA using FastQuant RT Kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China) according to manufacturers instructions, and was used for gene cloning and expression analysis.
2: The coding sequence of EgFAD8 was amplified by Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) using primers EgFAD8-pYES2 F and R with restriction site  KpnI and  XbaI, respectively ( Table 1).
3: PCR was performed with an initial denaturation at 98 C for 30s, 30 cycles at of 98 C for 10 s, 56 C for 30s, 72 C for 60 s and a final extension step of 72 C for 5 min.
4: The PCR product was cloned into the pEASY-Blunt vector (Transgen biotech, Beijing, China) and sequenced.
5: The cloning of  EgFAD8 promoter region sequence has been published in our previous study [ 44].
