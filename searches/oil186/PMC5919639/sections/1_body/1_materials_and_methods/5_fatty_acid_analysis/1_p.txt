0: Yeast cells were directly transmethylated by 2 mL of methanol containing 2.7% (v/v) H 2SO 4 at 80C for 2 hours.
1: Then, 3 mL of Hexane was added for recovering fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), and 2 mL of NaCl (2.5%, w/v) was used for phase separation.
2: After centrifuge, the upper hexane phase was transferred to a fresh tube and applied for gas chromatography (GC) analysis.
