0: Total RNA from mature leaves and mesocarp at five developmental stages were extracted as described previously, and cDNAs was used for real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).
1: EgFAD8 RT-PCR primers RT-EgFAD8 F/R ( Table 1) were designed for RT-qPCR.
2: The housekeeper gene -actin (RT--actin F/R,  Table 1) was used as an internal control for expression analysis.
3: RT-qPCR was carried out using a CFX Connect TM Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and SYBR  premix Ex Taq TM II (Tli RNaseH Plus) Kit (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturers instructions.
4: Expression was quantified as comparative threshold cycle (Ct) using 2 Ct method [ 49].
5: Reactions were in triplicate including template-free and no-reverse-transcriptase negative controls.
