0: In order to generate a yeast expression construct,  EgFAD8 fragments were digested with  KpnI and  XbaI from pEASY vector, and subcloned into pYES2 vector.
1: The construct EgFAD8-pYES2 and the control pYES2 were separately transformed into INVSc1 cells using the polyethylene glycol/lithium acetate method [ 45, 46].
2: Transformants were selected on synthetic complete medium lacking uracil (SC-U) supplemented with 2% (w/v) glucose.
3: Three independent positive clones of each transformation were used for further expression studies.
