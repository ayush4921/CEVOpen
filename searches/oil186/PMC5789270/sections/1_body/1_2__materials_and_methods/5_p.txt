0: EO diffusors were made by adding EO (10%  v/ v), sterilized deionized water (88%  v/ v) and Tween 20 (2%  v/ v) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) to agar-agar (Merck) (15 g/L).
1: Lower EO concentrations were obtained by serial dilutions.
2: 50 mL of medium were poured into Petri dishes and after agar solidification, 5 diffusors were installed in storage cabinets under the fruit boxes.
3: Fruit were stored in refrigerator cabinets (75  70  65 cm) at 0 C and 98% relative humidity for 28 days.
4: Fumigation was performed at 1% and 10% EO concentrations.
5: A total of four treatments were tested: thyme EO at 1%, thyme EO at 10%, savory EO at 1% and savory EO at 10%.
6: An untreated control was included.
7: The analyses were performed at 1, 14 and 28 days of cold storage.
