0: The effect of essential oils on conidial germination was investigated on two main peach and nectarine pathogens,  B. cinerea and  M. fructicola.
1: Two virulent strains isolated from peaches were stored on agar slant at 4 C until use.
2: B. cinerea conidial suspension was obtained from 15 days of culture grown on PDA+ streptomycin 25 mg/L at 25 C.  M. fructicola was cultured on tomato agar plate (250 mL of tomato puree, 750 mL of deionized water and 20 g of agar) amended with 25 mg of streptomycin for 5 days.
3: 5 mL of sterile deionized water were added to the plate and the mycelium was gently scraped with L-shaped spreader to detach the conidia.
4: Conidial suspension was filtered through four layers of sterile cheesecloth and 100 L were spread on PDA+ streptomycin plates.
5: PDA plates were sealed with the essential oil diffusor.
6: EOs were added to the diffusors at 350 L/L and 35 L/L, a concentration proportional to the quantity present in the cabinet considering the concentration of EO diffusor, the number of diffusors per cabinet and the volume of the cabinet and the plates.
7: Conidial germination was assessed after 20 h for  B. cinerea and 36 h for  M. fructicola counting 100 conidia per plate.
8: Three replicates were used for each treatment and the assay was repeated twice.
9: Conidia were considered germinated when the germ tube exceeded the conidial length.
