0: Ascorbic acid (AA) was determined according to Sanchez-Moreno et al.
1: [ 30] and Gonzalez-Molina et al.
2: [ 31], and evaluated at 0, 14 and 28 days (three replicates per treatment and per time point).
3: The ascorbic acid was extracted using 10 mL of extraction solvent (methanol:water 5:95  v/ v) and 10 g of fruit flesh from 10 fruit per treatment by homogenization with a T-25 Ultra-Turrax for 3 min.
4: Then, pH was adjusted to 2.22.4, and the extract was adsorbed onto a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters Associates, Milford, MA, USA).
5: The resultant solution was added to 1,2-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Fluka Chemika, Neu-Ulm, Switzerland) and left to stand for 37 min before HPLC analysis.
6: The AA and dehydroascorbic acid contents were expressed as mg/kg fresh weight.
7: Three replicate analyses were performed on the flesh.
8: The chromatographic system (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) was equipped a Kinetex-C18 column (4.6  150 mm, 5 m, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA), a pump and a diode array detector.
9: The system was controlled through HPLC online software (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) at 40 C. The mobile phase (isocratic) comprised 50 mM monobasic potassium phosphate and 5 mM cetrimide (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, Saint Louis, MO, USA) in methanol:water (5:95  v/ v).
10: The flow rate was 0.9 mL/min.
11: The detector was set at 261 nm for AA and 348 for dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA).
12: External calibration curves for AA and DHAA, respectively, were used for quantification.
13: The total run time was 15 min.
14: The detection limit is 0.5 mg/kg of fresh weight.
