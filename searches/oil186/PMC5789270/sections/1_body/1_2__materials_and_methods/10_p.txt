0: The carotenoid content was determined every 14 days, using the method reported by Talcott and Howard [ 29].
1: The carotenoids were extracted using 10 mL of extraction solvent (ethanol/acetone  w/ w with 0.2% butylhydroxytoluene) and 2 g of fresh sample from 10 fruit, homogenized at 24,000 rpm for 1 min using an Ultra-Turrax T-25 Tissue homogenizer (IKA -Labortechnik, Saufen, Germany).
2: The samples were then centrifuged at 2900 rpm for 20 min at 2 C (Avanti J-25 centrifuge, Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA, USA).
3: The recovered supernatants were combined with 30 mL of extraction solvent, 25 mL of hexane and 12.5 mL of nanopure water.
4: The tubes were left in the dark at 4 C for 1 h, then the samples were transferred to quartz cuvettes.
5: Absorbance was measured using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (DU 530, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) at 450 nm, with -carotene as an external standard.
6: The results are expressed as g -carotene equivalents per kg weight of fruit and are an average of three replicates per treatment and per time point (at 0, 14 and 28 days of storage).
