0: The EOs of thyme ( Thymus vulgaris) and savory ( Satureja montana) used in the assays were prepared by Soave (Turin, Italy).
1: The compositional analyses were performed using a gas chromatograph Shimadzu GC-2010 Plus (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a mass spectrometer GCMS-QP 2010 Ultra (Shimadzu) and a split-splitless injector.
2: The gas chromatograph was fitted with a 30 m  0.25 mm fused silica capillary Zebron ZB-5MSi column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) with 0.25 m film thickness.
3: Helium carrier gas using a linear velocity of 37 cm/s with a constant flow rate of 1.0 mL/min was used.
4: The pressure was 55 kPa and total flow was 105 mL/min.
5: Ion electron impact spectra at 70 eV were recorded in scan mode (30700 m/z).
