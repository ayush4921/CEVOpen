0: Pure essential oil of savory and thyme were diluted at 1% and 10% in  n-hexane (VWR, Radnor, PA, USA) for direct injection using split mode (80%).
1: Sampling in the chambers was performed using SPME fiber assembly 100 m PDMS (Supelco Analytical, Bellefonte, PA, USA) for 5 min in triplicate at 1, 14 and 28 days of incubation whereby the injector was in splitless mode.
2: Relative composition (percentage) of volatile compounds was calculated by comparing peak area to area of total chromatogram (from 7.5 to 40 min).
3: Absolute quantification was calculated for carvacrol and thymolusing a standard calibration curve between 1 and 50 ppm (mg/L).
4: Relative quantification was determined for the other compounds, by using standard calibration curve of thymol for thyme essential oil and standard calibration curve of carvacrol for savory essential oil.
