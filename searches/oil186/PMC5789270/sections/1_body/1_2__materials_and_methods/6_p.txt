0: After harvesting, healthy sound fruit were selected.
1: Rotten fruit were counted and incidence of diseased fruit was calculated for each treatment every 7 days up to 28 days of storage, and for 5 days of shelf life at 20 C. Pathogens were isolated by transferring small pieces of symptomatic fruit tissues, previously washed in 1% sodium hypochlorite and rinsed in sterile deionized water, onto potato dextrose agar (PDA, Merck) plates amended with 25 mg/L streptomycin sulfate (Merck).
2: A 7-day-old culture was used for DNA extraction by using the EZNA Plant DNA Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA, USA).
3: The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA of 50 isolates was amplified using the ITS1/ITS4 primers [ 28].
4: The PCR reaction mixture comprised 2 L 10  PCR buffer, 1 L ITS1 primer at 10 mM, 1 L of ITS4 primer at 10 mM, 1 L of nucleotides mixture at 5 mM, 12 L of MilliQ autoclaved water, 0.8 L of MgCl 2 at 25 mM, 0.2 L of Taq polymerase and 2 L of template DNA.
5: PCR cycles included a denaturing step at 95 C for 2 min and 35 cycles as follows: 94 C for 30 s, 55 C for 30 s, 72 C for 1 min and a final elongation step at 72 C for 7 min.
6: ITS amplicons were sequenced by BMR Genomics (Padua, Italy), and DNA sequences were compared with those present in the NCBI database and deposited with accession numbers.
