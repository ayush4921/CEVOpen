0: Hence, intense research efforts focus on developing innovative, unconventional, sustainable strategies to preserve fruit quality and decrease food losses.
1: The most promising control approaches are the use of microorganisms and natural products with intrinsic antimicrobial properties [ 13, 14].
2: Essential oils (EOs) represent a powerful tool to reduce the environmental impact of fruit production [ 15].
3: The efficacy of plant EOs has been extensively evaluated in vitro [ 16], but a few studies have been performed in vivo [ 17].
4: However, these treatments may modify the organoleptic characteristics of fruit, changing taste or flavor during cold storage.
