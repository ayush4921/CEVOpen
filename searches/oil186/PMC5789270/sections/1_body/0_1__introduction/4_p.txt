0: The antifungal activity of EOs is determined by their chemical composition.
1: In particular, aldehydes, phenols and ketones considerably inhibit pathogen growth.
2: Thymol, carvacrol and  p-anisaldehyde have a proven fungicidal activity and EOs rich in these components showed the highest inhibitory activity against many postharvest pathogens, such as  Penicillium digitatum [ 18],  Colletotrichum gloeosporioides [ 19] and  R. stolonifer [ 20].
3: EOs of thyme ( Thymus vulgaris) and savory ( Satureja montana) are mainly composed of thymol and carvacrol [ 21], which are highly effective in controlling fungal pathogens.
4: Generally, the efficacy of EOs is investigated through direct contact with fruit, by application through spraying or dipping [ 22].
5: However, these application methods can have undesired effects, including phytotoxicity and organoleptic modification of treated fruit.
6: Only a few studies have reported the efficacy of EO treatments through biofumigation, focusing on phytopathological aspects [ 23].
7: Scientific research recently started to pay particular attention to the assessment of the antifungal activity of EO vapors [ 24, 25].
8: Fumigation with thyme and savory EOs resulted in effective control of several postharvest pathogens, showing antifungal activity against  Colletotrichum [ 26],  Aspergillus,  Penicillium,  Mucor and  Trichoderma spp.
9: [ 27] The use of EOs through fumigation avoids the direct contact with the product, reducing the possibility of influencing the sensorial profile.
