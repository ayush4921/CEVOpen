0: The most common postharvest pathogens on stone fruit are  Monilinia spp.
1: ( M. fructigena Honey,  M. fructicola (G. Winter) Honey, and  M. laxa (Aderh.
2: and Ruhland) Honey), agents of brown rot,  Botrytis cinerea Pers.
3: agent of gray mold,  Penicillium expansum Link, agent of blue mold,  Alternaria spp., agent of black mold, and  Rhizopus stolonifer, Ehrenb., agent of Rhizopus rot [ 7, 8].
4: On peaches, postharvest losses can cause even higher damage than preharvest diseases [ 9].
5: Crop protection in Europe should be performed in the orchard because only one fungicide (fludioxonil) can be used on stone fruit after harvesting, but the supermarket chains typically request either no further postharvest treatments or a limited number of active ingredients, as residues, on the fruit.
6: The last fungicide has to be applied 1 or 2 weeks before harvesting, to guarantee a high level of fruit protection against pathogens during storage, and to remain below the maximum residue limits imposed by European legislation [ 10].
7: Moreover, consumer attention is attracted by environmentally friendly production practices, preferring foods treated with natural products instead of conventional pesticides [ 11].
8: At present,  Monilinia spp.
9: control depends on an integrated strategy based on orchard fungicide spray programs and maintenance of proper storage conditions in the packinghouse and during distribution [ 12].
