0:  The analysis of volatile organic compounds isolated from  T.minuta was performed using a complete HP/Agilent 6890/5973 GC-MS system with a FID detector (Palo Alto, USA).
1: The GC column specified for the methods was a capillary HP-5MS column (5% phenylmethylsiloxane, 30 m X 0.25 mm i.d., coating thickness 0.25 m).
2: The injector temperature was set at 250 C and helium carrier gas flow was adjusted to 1 ml/min.
3: The samples pass through the interface heated to 200 C into the mass spectrometer operated at 70 eV, which is scanned from 30-300 amu.
4: The electron multiplier voltage was increased to near 3000 V, and the injection volume was 1 l. GC oven temperature ranged from 70o to 240 C at l0 C /min.
5: Qualitative identification for separated constituents was achieved using MS data libraries (Wiley7n.1 and NIST 2008), by comparison of their retention time (RT) obtained on HP-5MS column and then verified by (RI, HP-5MS) with those published in the literature.
