0:  where A0 is absorbance of the blank and AS is absorbance of the sample at 520 nm.
1: Also the IC 50 of the plant was obtained by plotting the percent DPPH remaining at the steady state (60 min) of the reaction against the corresponding antioxidant level.
2: The IC 50 is the concentration of antioxidant to quench 50% DPPH under the experimental conditions.
