0:  The free-radical scavenging activity was measured by the decrease in absorbance of methanolic solution of DPPH.
1: 26 Briefly, 10 l of the samples were added to 2 ml of methanolic DPPH (0.0023 mol/l) solution, and allowed to react at room temperature.
2: After 30 min the absorbance values were measured at 520 nm and converted into the percentage antioxidant activity using the following formula:
