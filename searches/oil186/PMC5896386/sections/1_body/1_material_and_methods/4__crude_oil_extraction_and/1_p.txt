0:  Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were prepared using 2 mol/l NaOH in methanol and n-heptane.
1: The oil samples were analyzed for chemical components using GC equipped with Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID, model 6890 N, Agilent Technologies, USA) and DB-Wax capillary column having 30 meter length (30 m, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 m film thickness).
2: It was also fitted to a injector with Agilent tapered liner (4mm id).
3: A fixed quantity of oil (1 l) was injected into the column after dilution.
4: Oven temperature ranged between 100-230 C. The temperature of the FID injection system was 250 C and that of FID detector was 280 C. Nitrogen carrier gas flow was adjusted to 1.8 ml/min.
5: The identification of individual component was made by running standards (Sigma, Chemical Co.St.
6: Louis).
7: The area under individual peak being calibrated into percent area by integrator itself, gives the percentage of individual component in the sample.
