0:  Quantification of flavonoids was based on a procedure described by Shin et al.
1: consisting of a spectrophotometric test at 510 nm.
2: 25 Methanolic solution of extracts and EOs (20 l) were mixed with 1 ml of distilled water and 0.075 ml of a 5% Sodium nitrite solution.
3: After 5 min, 0.15 ml of 10% aluminium chloride solution was added.
4: It was left at room temperature for 6 min and 0.5 ml of sodium hydroxide (1 mol/l) was added.
5: Then the absorbance of each mixture was measured immediately at 510 nm with a double beam UV/Visible spectrophotometer.
6: The calibration curve was plotted by preparing quercetin solutions in methanol.
7: (The calibration equation for quercetin: y = 0.0779 x - 0.0136, R 2 = 0.9979).
