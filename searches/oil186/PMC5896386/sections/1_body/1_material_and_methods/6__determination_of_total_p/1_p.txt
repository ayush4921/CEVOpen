0:  Total phenolic concentration (TPC) in the bioactive extracts namely the methanol extracts and essential oils were estimated spectrophotometrically (WPA Biowave S2100) by the FolinCiocalteu (FC) assay described perviously with slight modification.
1: 24 In this study the TPC was expressed as milligrams of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) per gram dry weight of samples.
2: Briefly, an aliquot of (20 l) the samples were transferred into a test tube and 1 ml reactive FC (previously diluted 10-fold) was added and mixed.
3: Afterward, 0.8 ml of 7.5% sodium carbonate solution was added to the mixture and mixed gently.
4: After incubation for 30 min in the dark and at ambient temperature (25 C), the absorbance was read at 765 nm of wave length against blank by using a UVVisible spectrophotometer.
5: TPC values were calculated from a standard curve plotted with known concentration of gallic acid and all determinations were done in triplicate.
6: (The calibration equation for Gallic acid: y =0.0421 x - 0.0232, R 2 =0.998).
