0:  Methanol extract (80%) and essential oil of the plant were evaluated in this study.
1: The main Polyphenol standards were used for separation and characterisation of phenolic compounds in the aromatic herb.
2: The analysis of phenolic acids was performed with a HPLC system Knauer-Germany equipped with UV-Vis detector according to the method proposed the authors.
3: 23 The filtered samples were injected on Eurospher 1005 C 18 column (25 cm X 4.6 mm; 5 m) from Agilent Technologies.
4: In this experiment, the mobile phase for the HPLC-UV system was composed of deionized water/acetic acid (2% v/v) as solvent A and acetonitrile as solvent B at flow rate 0.8 ml/min.
5: The gradient used in the evaluation was as follows: from 0 to 5 min isocratic 85% A flow, from 5 to 19 min a linear gradient of 85% A to 100% B.
6: In this process, fifteen minutes of equilibration (85% A) is required before another injection.
7: The column temperature was maintained at 25C and the injection volume was 20 l. Peaks were detected at 280 nm.
8: Finally, phenolic compounds were determined according to their UV spectra, relative retention times and comparison with reference curves.
