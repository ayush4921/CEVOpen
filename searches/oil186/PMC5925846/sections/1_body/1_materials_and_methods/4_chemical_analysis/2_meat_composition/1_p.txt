0: Composition of fatty acids in oil extractions taken from breast and leg meats were determined by an anonymous method [ 32].
1: To determine the fatty acid composition, crude fat of the breast and leg meats were extracted using a chloroform:methanol (2:1, vol/vol) mixture according to the method described by Folch et al.
2: [ 33].
3: Fatty acids were measured using an HP-6890 gas chromatograph (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA).
4: The determination of nutrient composition, dry matter, crude ash, crude fat analysis of breast and leg meats (which had been homogenized by shredding), were carried out in accordance with the Weende analysis method [ 20].
5: The crude protein contents of breast and thigh meats were determined employing the method developed by Kjeldahly [ 34].
6: The amount of nitrogen found as a result of the analysis was multiplied by the factor of 6.25 and the crude protein contents of the samples were found.
