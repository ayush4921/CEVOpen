0: A total of 400 male-female broiler chicks (Ross-308) were used as animal material.
1: Experiments were carried out with 5 groups each containing 80 chicks: 4 treatment groups and 1 control group.
2: Each group was further divided into 5 sub-groups each composed of 16 chicks.
3: Among these five dietary treatment groups formed for the trial, the control group was fed without any feed additives.
4: The second group was fed with 150 mg capsicum oleoresin per kg of feed, the third group with 150 mg carvacrol per kg of feed, the fourth group with 150 mg cinnamaldehyde per kg of feed, and the last group with 150 mg mixtures (CAP+CAR+CIN) per kg of feed.
5: The trial was maintained for 6 weeks.
6: Feeds that were used in the experiments were obtained from a commercial feed factory (EGETAV, Izmir, Turkey).
7: Rations were prepared in accordance with the nutrient requirements provided in NRC [ 19] (Table  1).
8: Rations for each treatment group were prepared by adding 150 mg / kg each of capsicum oleoresin (CAP), carvacrol (CAR), cinnamaldehyde (CIN) or their mixture (CAP+CAR+CIN).
9: To ensure a homogeneous blend, secondary metabolites were pre-mixed with zeolite and the generated crumble was added to the feed.
10: Commercially marketed synthetic 99% carvacrol, 98% cinnamaldehyde and naturally produced 99% capsicum oleoresin and their combinations at a ratio of 1:1:1 were used.
11: The amount of food substance of the feeds used (except for raw cellulose) was specified according to the Weende [ 20] method while the raw cellulose was specified according to the Lepper method [ 21].
12: The regression equation suggested by the 9610 No TSI was used for calculation of the metabolizable energy content [ 22].
