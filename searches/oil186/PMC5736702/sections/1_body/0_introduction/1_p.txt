0: The recent boom in unconventional oil and gas production from shale has revolutionized the energy landscape in the United States 1 and stimulated both considerable research 2  5 as well as environmental and political concerns.
1: Shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock, composed of solid organic matter (OM) scattered in a mineral framework.
2: This solid OM is the source of petroleum, as the OM breaks down into oil and gas under high temperatures during a process known as maturation.
3: The solid OM remaining after maturation develops a network of nanoscale pores responsible for hydrocarbon storage and transport during petroleum production and migration over geologic time 6  8.
4: Additionally, OM partially controls shales geomechanical properties as it is the softest component, affecting both fracturing efficiency and flow of petroleum to the wellbore 9.
5: Therefore, investigation of geochemical and geomechanical properties of OM in shale is important for building robust geological models to access unconventional resources and enhance hydrocarbon production efficiency.
