0: In this study, we demonstrate the first application of AFM-IR in the earth sciences.
1: This technique is used to provide direct, in situ, simultaneous geochemical and geomechanical characterization of individual dispersed OM particles at nanoscale.
2: The AFM-IR images are correlated with optical microscopy images to analyze chemical and mechanical properties of macerals (optically discernible organic constituents) in a New Albany Shale sample.
3: To understand the impacts of maturation on nanoscale OM composition, similar measurements are performed on a series of samples prepared to different stages of maturation by laboratory hydrous pyrolysis.
4: This approach allows evaluation of compositional and mechanical variations among different macerals and unravels the chemical evolution of different macerals with increasing maturity.
5: Beyond the bulk picture provided by conventional analysis, this approach of following compositional and mechanical evolution of individual macerals at the relevant length scale during maturation provides a microscopic picture of the heterogeneous process of petroleum generation.
