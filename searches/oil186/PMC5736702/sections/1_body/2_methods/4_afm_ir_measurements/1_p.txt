0: The localized nanoscale mid-IR spectra and images were carried out using the commercial NanoIR2 AFM-IR instrument (Anasys Instruments).
1: The AFM-IR technique is accomplished by coupling a pulsed tunable IR source with an AFM.
2: The IR source covers a broad range of the mid-IR region, produced by a tunable optical parametric oscillator laser system (EKSPLA) with ~ 10 ns pulse length at a repetition rate of 1 kHz.
