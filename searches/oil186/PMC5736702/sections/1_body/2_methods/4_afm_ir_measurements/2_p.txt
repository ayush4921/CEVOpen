0: The topography, IR absorption, and contact resonance frequency image (stiffness map) are collected simultaneously at a fixed wavenumber of interest.
1: All images are acquired in contact mode using probes (Model: PR-EX-NIR2, Anasys Instruments) with a resonance frequency of 13  4 kHz and a spring constant of 0.070.4 N m 1.
2: The characterization measures the photothermal-induced resonance of the AFM cantilever 28  31.
3: Here, the second mode of cantilever oscillation is selected by applying a bandpass filter centered at 180 kHz with 50 kHz window.
4: The images are acquired at a scan rate of 0.2 Hz and averaged over 8 pulses, with a 100 nm  100 nm spatial resolution.
5: The image acquisition time is ~25 min for a 30  30 m area or 11 min for a 20  20 m area.
6: The spatial resolution of IR absorption imaging is affected by sample thermomechanical properties such as thermal expansion coefficient and thermal conductivity 28  31.
7: The typical spatial resolution of IR images is around 100 nm.
8: Stiffness mapping offers enhanced resolution limited by the tip radius of the cantilever, typically in the range of 10 s of nanometers.
