0: Total organic carbon (TOC) analysis and Rock-Eval II (a programmed pyrolysis method) are routine source rock geochemistry characterization methods, allowing evaluation of the amount, type and thermal maturity of organic matter present.
1: TOC and Rock-Eval were carried out in a commercial laboratory following methods previously described in Barker 48 and Peters et al.
2: 36 Leco TOC measurements were performed by combustion of acidified pulverized rock to quantify organic richness.
3: Rock-Eval II pyrolysis measures hydrocarbon generating potential and thermal maturity.
4: Rock-Eval heats samples in programmed stages ranging from 100 to 850 C, yielding four parameters: S1 measures the amount of vaporized free hydrocarbons, S2 measures the amount of hydrocarbons generated through thermal cracking of nonvolatile organic matter, S3 measures the amount of CO 2 produced during pyrolysis, and  Tmax (pyrolysis temperature during maximum generation of hydrocarbons).
5: S1, S2, and S3 are used to compute hydrogen, oxygen, and production indices [HI: 100  S2/TOC; OI: 100  S3/TOC; PI: S1/(S1 + S2)].
6: HI and OI determine the organic matter type, whereas  Tmax and PI represent the thermal maturity of organic matter.
