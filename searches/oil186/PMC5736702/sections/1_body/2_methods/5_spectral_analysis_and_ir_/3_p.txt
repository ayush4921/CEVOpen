0: The spectral region at 28003000 cm 1 can be resolved into five discrete bands: CH stretching (2897 cm 1), symmetric CH 2 stretching (2857 cm 1), CH 2 asymmetric stretching (2925 cm 1), CH 3 symmetric stretching (2872 cm 1), and CH 3 asymmetric stretching (2962 cm 1).
1: The broad absorbance band between 3000 and 3100 cm 1 region is assigned to aromatic CH stretching and used to compute Aromaticity.
2: CH 3/CH 2 ratio are computed from the ratio of integrated peak areas arising from 2957 and 2925 cm 1, respectively, i.e., A 2957/A 2925.
