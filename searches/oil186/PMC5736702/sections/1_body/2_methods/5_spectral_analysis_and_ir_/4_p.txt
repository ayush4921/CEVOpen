0: The 15001800 cm 1 region contains overlapping absorbance bands associated with oxygenated and aromatic carbon groups.
1: The broad absorbance 16001630 cm 1 corresponds to aromatic carboncarbon stretching, and it can be resolved as two distinct peaks in the spectra of organic materials centered at 1610 and 1630 cm 1.
2: A 16001630 represents the integrated peak intensity of the aromatic C=C vibrations centered at 1610 and 1630 cm 1.
3: The 1450 and 1375 cm 1 absorption signals are due to aliphatic CH bending.
4: C-factor represents the intensity ratio of the oxygenated versus aromatic functional groups.
5: A-factor is the intensity ratio of aliphatic/ (aliphatic + aromatic) bands.
6: A-factor is calculated slightly different from Craddocks method 43.
7: The integrated peak area under 1450 cm 1 is used instead of the area under 2857 and 2925 as the aliphatic absorption bands.
8: This is because the pulsed optical parametric oscillator (OPO) laser used in the nano-IR instrument has two distinct stages.
9: The laser spot size and focus is different in the different stages, thus it is difficult to compute quantitative IR ratios using intensity values from two different stages.
