0: Localized IR spectra were collected and analyzed using Analysis Studio software (version 3.11.5883, Anasys Instruments) and MATLAB program.
1: IR focus is optimized at 1450 cm 1, 1600 cm 1, and 2920 cm 1 prior to the data collection and all IR spectra are normalized to the incident power.
2: IR spectra are acquired from 1300 to 1800 cm 1 and 2800 to 3100 cm 1 with an interval of 4 cm 1 and averaging each data point over 256 pulses.
3: The spectral acquisition time is around 5 min.
4: The localized IR spectra is first smoothed using a three-point average in Analysis Studio, followed by linear baseline removal, normalized, and plotted in MATLAB.
