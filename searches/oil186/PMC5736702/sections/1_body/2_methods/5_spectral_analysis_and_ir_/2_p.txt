0: Curve fitting of the absorbance bands in IR spectra between 15001800 cm 1 and 28003100 cm 1 were performed to determine spectral parameters in MATLAB.
1: A combination of LorentzianGaussian curve functions provides a good statistical reconstruction of the measured IR spectra of complex organic matter 43.
2: The parameters are fitted to the experimental envelope by a least squares iterative procedure.
3: All peaks centers, peak amplitudes, peak half-widths, relative fraction of Lorentzian character for the fit are allowed to vary from initial guesses.
4: Generally, the solved peak centers are typically within a few centimeters from the initialization.
5: The IR structural parameters, namely, Aromaticity, CH 3/CH 2, C-Factor, A-Factor, are computed from the peak area ratios as listed in Supplementary Table  1.
