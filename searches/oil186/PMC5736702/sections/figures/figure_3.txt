0:  Nanoscale geochemical and geomechanical characterization.
1: Inertinite ( a), solid bitumen ( b), and Tasmanites ( c) in stiffness images are identified by comparison with photomicrograph of the same field (Figs.
2: 1a and  2a).
3: Areas outside of regions of interest are masked with opaque color to screen out irrelevant contact resonance (CR) frequency measurements.
4: CR frequency histogram for 130.74 m 2 area of inertinite ( d), 272.97 m 2 area of solid bitumen ( e), and 201.67 m 2 area of Tasmanites ( f).
5: Localized IR spectra from different locations (colored points in corresponding stiffness images) in inertinite ( g), solid bitumen ( h), and Tasmanites ( i) )  )  Fig.
