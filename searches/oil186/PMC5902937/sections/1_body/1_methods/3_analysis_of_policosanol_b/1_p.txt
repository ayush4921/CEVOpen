0: GC-MS analyses were performed using a capillary HP-5MS column (30 m  0.25 mm I.D., 0.25 m film thickness; Agilent Technologies) with gas chromatography (Agilent Technologies 7820A) coupled directly to the mass detector (Agilent Technologies 5975 series MSD).
1: Helium was used as carrier gas, with a constant flow rate of 1 ml/ min.
2: The injector and detector temperatures were 230 C. The oven temperature was programmed from 150 to 320 C at 10 Cmin  1 from 150 to 250 C and at 5 Cmin  1 from 250 to 320 C. Manual injection of 1 L of the aliphatic alcohol solution was performed in the split mode at a 10:1 split ratio.
3: The policosanol compounds were identified by comparing their mass spectra with the Wiley 275.L Mass Spectral Library.
