0: The reaction mixture (5 ml) was comprised of 0.2 ml of fresh hens egg albumin, 2.8 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 6.4) and 2mlof oil samples.
1: Similar volume of double distilled water served as control.
2: Then the mixture was incubated at 37 C in the incubator for 15 min and then heated at 70 C for 5 min.
3: After cooling, their absorbance was measured at 660 nm by using pure blank.
4: The percentage inhibition of protein denaturation was calculated as mentioned in Bovine serum albumin (BSA) denaturation method.
