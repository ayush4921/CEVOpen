0: The saponification and the Thin layer chromatography analysis of unsaponoifiables were done according to the previous reports [ 12].
1: The unsaponifiable fraction and the authentic 1-eicosanol were spotted on preparative silica gel thin-layer plates (silica gel 60G F254) and developed with hexanediethyl ether (65:35,  v/v).
2: After development, the plate was sprayed with 2,7-dichlorofluorescein and viewed under UV light.
3: The band corresponding to aliphatic alcohols was scraped, extracted three times with chloroformdiethyl ether (1:1, v/v), filtered to remove the residual silica, dried in a rotary evaporator and stored at  10 C.
