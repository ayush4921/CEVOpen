0: The ABTS radical scavenging capacity of the oil was measured using the method described by Rubalya and Neelamegam [ 35].
1: The ABTS + radical was generated by oxidation of 2.5 ml of ABTS solution (7 mM) with potassium persulfate (14.7 mM).
2: The mixture is kept in the dark for 16 h at room temperature (25 C).
3: Before usage, the mixture was diluted with water to obtain an absorbance of 0.70  0.05 at 734 nm.
4: The radical scavenging activity is assessed by mixing 2 ml of this diluted ABTS+ solution with different oil samples dissolved in benzene.
5: After 30 min, the percentage inhibition at 734 nm was calculated for each sample relative to blank absorbance.
6: The percentage inhibition of ABTS radical by the oils was calculated using the equation described in the DPPH assay.
