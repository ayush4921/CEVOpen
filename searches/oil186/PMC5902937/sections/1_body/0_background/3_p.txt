0: Milk thistle ( Silybum marianum L.) is an important medicinal plant from the family  Asteraceae.
1: The bioactive compounds are mainly concentrated in its seeds which have been used for more than 2000 years to treat liver diseases.
2: Milk thistle seeds contain 17.530.5% of lipids rich in unsaturated fatty acids and 13% of silymarin [ 10,  26,  27]..
3: Recently, certain  Silybum marianum accessions have begun to be cultivated in several countries and the specie is undergoing domestication for making the supply of silymarin sustainable [ 28].
4: Previously published studies examined the triacylglycerol, fatty acid, tocopherol, sterol and polyhpenol composition of milk thistle seeds [ 10,  26,  29 32].
5: Significant differences were observed between milk thistle cultivars for the content of bioactive compounds [ 10].
6: Also, the antioxidant properties of ethanolic extracts of milk thistle seeds and methanolic extracts of cold-pressed milk thistle seed oil have been reported [ 10,  31].To the best of our knowledge, however, no data has been published on the policosanol composition and the anti-arthritic activity of milk thistle oil.
7: Therefore, this study aimed to examine the policosanol profile, anti-arthritic and antioxidant activities of milk thistle oil at different stages of seed maturity.
8: Such data could serve for the evaluation of nutritional and health impact of milk thistle oil and for the development of new source of natural bioactive compounds.
